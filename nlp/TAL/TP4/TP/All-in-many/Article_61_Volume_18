Research on the risk assessment of the green construction of hydraulic tunnels based a on combination weighting-cloud model.
Based on the complex and significant green construction characteristics of modern hydraulic tunnel engineering and the identified risks thereof, an index was weighted using a combination weighting method (improved analytic hierarchy process and entropy weighting methods). A cloud model for the green construction risk evaluation of a hydraulic tunnel was constructed based on cloud theory. After applying this model to typical engineering situations, the digital features of the cloud model and an evaluation cloud map of each index were obtained. The investigation showed that in the green construction risk of hydraulic tunnels, the degree of green construction management risk was the highest, risk uncertainty of environmental pollution and damage risk was the largest, and construction resource utilization risk was the most unstable. The comprehensive cloud map revealed that the green construction risk of hydraulic tunnels lay between grades I and II (small and minor risk, respectively), being closer to grade II. Considering the evaluation results, techniques were identified to improve green construction planning and strengthen green construction management training to reduce project green construction risks.
