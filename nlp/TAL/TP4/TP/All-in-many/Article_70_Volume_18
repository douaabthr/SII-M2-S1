Quantum bee-inspired algorithm using quantum circuit and gradient descent optimizer on product recommendation.
Bee-inspired algorithms, designed to mimic bee foraging activity, are renowned for their effectiveness in addressing complex optimization problems. Classic bee-inspired algorithms face challenges when applied to large-scale datasets due to computing limitations. Integrating quantum circuits into these algorithms has the potential to address this issue by improving computational efficiency and accuracy. This work intends to measure the performance of a quantum bee-inspired algorithm using quantum circuits and a gradient descent optimizer (QBIAGDO). The model’s performance is compared with three other classical bee-inspired algorithms, such as BIAHCO, BIASAO, and BIAGAO, across the datasets: Bigbasket, supermarket sales, and Nykaa product review. The models were assessed based on computational efficiency and prediction accuracy, using measures such as iteration time, mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean squared error (RMSE). QBIAGDO regularly outperformed the other models, finishing iterations substantially faster and generating lower MAE and RMSE values. For the Bigbasket dataset, QBIAGDO completed 50 iterations in 37.55 s, with an MAE of 0.86 and RMSE of 0.91, exhibiting greater performance. The QBIAGDO shows itself to be the most efficient and accurate model among those examined, providing significant improvements in computing speed and prediction accuracy. This study illustrates the potential of QBIAGDO for large-scale predictive analytics, proposing its broader application across many sectors.
