In
traditional

robotics
robot
controllers
are
evolved
in
a
separate
design
phase
preceding
actual
deployment
we
call
this
off-line
evolution

Alternatively
robot
controllers
can
evolve

perform

this

In

Our

that
it
seems
preferable

try
many
alternative

spend
little
effort
on
refining
possibly
faulty
assessments
that
there
is
no
single
combination
of
parameters
that
performs
well
on
all
problem
instances

that
the
most
influential
parameter
of
this
algorithm
and
therefore
the
prime
candidate
for
a
control
scheme
is
the
evaluation
length
