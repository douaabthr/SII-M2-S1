Response
to
Pauline
Hogeweg
s
review
of
my
book
Evolution
a
view
from
the
21st
century
</s>
<s>
It
is
a
great
irony
to
be
criticized
in
a
journal
with
the
adventurous
title
of
Evolutionary
Intelligence
for
using
the
terms
cognitive
sentient
and
thoughtful
as
Pauline
Hogeweg
did
in
her
review
</s>
<s>
I
myself
by
the
way
never
used
the
term
thoughtful
.
It
appeared
in
a
quotation
from
Barbara
McClintock
s
fascinating
and
instructive
1983
Nobel
Prize
lecture
the
