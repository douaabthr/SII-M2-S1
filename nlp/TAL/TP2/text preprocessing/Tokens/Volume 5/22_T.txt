The
present
paper
proposes
a
peer-to-peer
P2P
information
retrieval
and
sharing
system
that
evolutionarily
creates
linkages
of
information
sources
that
are
useful
for
both
information
publishers
and
information
users
where
information
is
managed
in
a
decentralized
manner
</s>
<s>
The
proposed
system
relies
on
interactions
among
information
publishers
who
actually
generate
information
and
have
the
greatest
knowledge
of
the
information
information
users
who
use
the
information
and
a
network
that
creates
useful
linkages
of
information
sources
information
publishers

In

publishers
propose
new
