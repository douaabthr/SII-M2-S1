Fraud
is
a
serious
problem
that
costs
the
worldwide
economy
billions
of
dollars
annually
</s>
<s>
However
fraud
detection
is
difficult
as
perpetrators
actively
attempt
to
mask
their
actions
among
typically
overwhelming
large
volumes
of
legitimate
activity
</s>
<s>
In
this
paper
we
investigate
the
fraud
detection
problem
and
examine
how
learning
classifier
systems
can
be
applied
to
it
</s>
<s>
We
describe
the
common
properties
of
fraud
introducing
an
abstract
problem
which
can
be
tuned
to
exhibit
those
characteristics
</s>
<s>
We
report
experiments
on
this
abstract
problem
with
a
popular
real-time
learning
classifier
system
algorithm
results
from
our
experiments
demonstrating
that
this
approach
can
overcome
the
difficulties
inherent
to
the
fraud
detection
problem
</s>

Finally
we
apply
the
algorithm
to
a
real-world
problem
and
show
that
it
can
achieve
good
performance
