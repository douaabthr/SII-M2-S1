Evolution
is
one
of
the
major
omnipresent
powers
in
the
universe
that
has
been
studied
for
about
two
centuries
</s>
<s>
Recent
scientific
and
technical
developments
make
it
possible
to
make
the
transition
from
passively
understanding
to
actively
using
evolutionary
processes
</s>
<s>
Today
this
is
possible
in
Evolutionary
Computing
where
human
experimenters
can
design
and
manipulate
all
components
of
evolutionary
processes
in
digital
spaces
</s>
<s>
We
argue
that
in
the
near
future
it
will
be
possible
to
implement
artificial
evolutionary
processes
outside
such
imaginary
spaces
and
make
them
physically
embodied
</s>
<s>
In
other
words
we
envision
the
Evolution
of
Things
rather
than
just
the
evolution
of
digital
objects
leading
to
a
new
field
of
Embodied
Artificial
Evolution
EAE

The
main
objective
of
this
paper
is
to
present
a
unifying
vision
in
order
to
aid
the
development
of
this
high
potential
research
area
</s>
<s>
To
this
end
we
introduce
the
notion
of
EAE
discuss
a
few
examples

applications

elaborate
on
the
expected
benefits
as
well
as
the
grand
challenges
this
developing

will
have
to
address
