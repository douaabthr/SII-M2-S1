XCSR
is
an
accuracy-based
learning
classifier
system
which
can
handle
classification
problems
with
real-value
features

However
as
the
number
of
features
increases
a
high
classification
accuracy
comes
at
the
cost
of
more
resources
larger
population
sizes

longer
computational
running
times

PCA-XCSR

being

reduce
