Aging
is
a
general
mechanism
that
some
randomized
search
heuristics
employ
to
increase
the
diversity

their
collection
of

points

A
more
diverse
collection

believed
to
improve
the

The
most

randomized

heuristics
with

evolutionary

While
it
is
known
that
randomized

heuristics
with

can
be
very
much
more

the

We
prove
