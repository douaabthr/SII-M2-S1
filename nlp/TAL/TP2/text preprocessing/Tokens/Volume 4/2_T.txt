Evolutionary
Algorithms
EAs
are
population-based
stochastic
search
algorithms
that
mimic
natural
evolution
</s>

Over
the
years
EAs
have
been
successfully
applied
to

In
this
paper
we
present
three
novel
evolutionary
approaches
and
analyze
their
performances
for
synthesizing
classifiers
with
EAs
in
supervised
data
mining
scenarios
</s>
<s>
The
first
approach
is
based
on
encoding
rule
sets
with
bit
string
genomes
while
the
second
one
utilizes
Genetic
Programming
GP
to
create
decision
trees
with
arbitrary
expressions
attached
to
the
nodes
</s>
<s>
The
novelty
of
these
two
approaches
lies
in
the
use
of
solutions
on
the
Pareto
front
as
an
ensemble
</s>
<s>
The
third
approach
EDDIE-101
is
also
based
on
GP
but
uses
a
new
advanced
fitness
measure
and
some
novel
genetic
operators
</s>
<s>
We
compare
these
approaches
to
a
number
of
well-known
data
mining
methods
including
C4
.
5
and
Random-Forest
and
show
that
the
performances
of
our
evolved
classifiers
can
be
very
competitive
as
far
as
the
solution
quality
is
concerned
</s>
<s>
In
addition
the
proposed
approaches
work
well
across
a
wide
range
of
configurations
and
EDDIE-101
particularly
has
been
highly
efficient
</s>
<s>
To
further
evaluate
the
flexibility
of
EDDIE-101
across
different
problem
domains
we
also
test
it
on
some
real
financial
datasets
for
finding
investment
opportunities
and
compare
the
results
with
those
obtained
using
other
classifiers

Numerical

EDDIE-101
can
