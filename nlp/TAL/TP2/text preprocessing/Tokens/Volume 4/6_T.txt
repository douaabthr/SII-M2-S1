The
field
of
Artificial
Immune
Systems
AIS
derives
inspiration
from
processes
and
mechanisms
apparent
in
the
biological
immune
system
</s>
<s>
After
early
applications
of
this
paradigm
to
problems
in
anomaly
detection
and
classification
the
field
rapidly
expanded
leading
to
a
number
of
successful
optimization
algorithms
and
more
recently
applications
in
fields
as
diverse
as
swarm
robotics
and
wireless
sensor
networks
.
