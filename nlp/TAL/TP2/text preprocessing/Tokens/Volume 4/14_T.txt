This
work
investigates
an
artificial
immune
optimization
system
suitable
for
single
and
multi-objective
constrained
optimization
</s>
<s>
In
this
optimizer
an
evaluation
index
which
can
decide
the
importance
of
individual
in
the
current
population
is
developed
to
accelerate
population
division
the
niching-like
proliferation
scheme
is
introduced
to
strengthen
the
diversity
of
population
</s>

Thereafter
those
diverse
antibodies
with
the
help
of
immune
evolution
operations
evolve
their
structures
along
different
directions

<s>
Theoretical
results
show
that
such
optimization
system
is
convergent
with
low
computational
complexity
</s>
<s>
Experimentally
one
such
optimizer
is
sufficiently
examined
by
a
suite
of
single
and
multi-objective
test
problems
</s>
<s>
Comparative
experiments
illustrate
that
the
optimizer
with
some
striking
characteristics
is
a
potentially
alternative
optimization
tool
for
constrained
omni-optimization
.
