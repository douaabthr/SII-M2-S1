Intrusion
detection

Various

In
this

we
propose
a
new
technique
by
combining
Ensemble
of
Feature
Selection
EFS
and
Adaptive
Grasshopper
Optimization
Algorithm
AGOA
methods
called
EFSAGOA
which
can
help
to
identify
the
types
of
attack

In
the
proposed
approach
initially
EFS
method
is
applied
to
rank
the
attribute
for
selecting
the
high
ranked
subset
of
attributes

Then
AGOA
is
employed
to
determine
important
attributes
from
the
reduced
datasets
that
can
contribute

predict

behavior

Furthermore
adaptive

GOA
uses

decide

a

AGOA
uses
the
Support

a
fitness
function

choose
the
extremely

to
maximize
the
classification
performance

In

The
performance

EFSAGOA

The
experimental

demonstrate
that
the
