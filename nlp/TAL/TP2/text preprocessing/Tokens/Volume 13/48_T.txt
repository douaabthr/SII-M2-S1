Optimal

for
Telugu
speaker
diarization
</s>
<s>
Speaker
indexing
or
diarization
is
the
process
of
automatically
partitioning
the
conversation
involving
multiple
speakers
into
homogeneous
segments
and
grouping
together
all
the
segments
that
correspond
to
the
same
speaker
</s>
<s>
So
far
certain
works
have
been
done
under
this
aspect
still
the
need
of
accurate
partitioning
process
gets
lagged
under
certain
criteria
</s>
<s>
With
this
in
mind
this
paper
aims
to
introduce
a
new
speaker
indexing
or
diarization
model
Telugu
language
that
initially
involves
Mel
Frequency
Cepstral
coefficient
based
feature
extraction

Subsequently
a
new
Optimized
Artificial
Neural
Network
ANN
is
introduced
for
clustering
process

<s>
The
novelty
behind
the
clustering
process
is
the
training
of
ANN
takes
place
through
optimization
logic
that
updates
the
weight
of
ANN
by
a
hybrid
concept
of
Artificial
Bee
Colony
ABC
and
Lion
Algorithm
LA
</s>
<s>
Thereby
the
proposed
model
is
named
as
ANN-ABC-LA
model

<s>
Finally
the
performance
of
the
proposed
ANN-ABC-LA
model
is
compared
over
the
state-of-the-art
models
with
respect
to
different
performance
measures
