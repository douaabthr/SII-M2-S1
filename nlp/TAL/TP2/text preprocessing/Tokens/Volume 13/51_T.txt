In
this

a

swarm
optimization
algorithm
PSOEL
is
proposed
to
solve
the
motion
planning

manipulators
</s>
<s>
PSOEL
consists
of
one
elite
group
and
several
child
groups
</s>
<s>
The
population
is
initialized
with
a
pre-selection
mechanism
in
which
the
members
of
the
elite
group
are
initialized
with
the
best-performing
particles
of
the
child
groups
</s>

In

process

iteration
the
elite
group

child
groups
evolve
separately

When
the
elite
group
falls
into
a
local
optimum

is
inferior
to
child

for
a

an
interaction
mechanism
is
triggered
</s>
<s>
In
the
interaction
mechanism
some
of

the
elite
group

<s>
With
these
mechanism
of
pre-selection

PSOEL
can
jump
out
of
the
local

reach
