In
order

reveal

fluctuation
rules
hidden
in
a
stock

dataset
with
noise
a
novel
forecasting
model
combining
Markov

theory
with
fuzzy

theory
is
proposed
in
this
study

A
fuzzified
one-step

Markov
Chain
in
the
paper
represents
inherent
rules
of
historical
fluctuation

<s>
Comparing
with
existing
models
the
advantage
of
the
proposed
model
is
that
transition
matrix
can
express
the
relationship
between
history
and
current
flexibly
while
the
introduction
of
fuzzy
theory
can
help
to
alleviate
noises

Therefore
the
proposed
model
could
handle
complex
patterns
during
state
transitions
and
the
relatively
simple
forecasting
algorithm
could
reduce

cost

We
apply
the
