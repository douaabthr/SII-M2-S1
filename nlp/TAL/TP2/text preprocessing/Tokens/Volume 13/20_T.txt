A

pattern
describes
coexistence
of
spatial
features

instances
frequently
appear
together
in
geographic
space

Numerous
studies
have
been
proposed
to
discover
interesting
co-location
patterns
from
spatial
data
sets

most
of
them
only
use
the

In
this
paper
we
take
additional
attributes

instances
into
account
in
the
process

co-location

mining

propose
a
new
approach
for
discovering

In
our
approach
we
consider
the
spatial

relationships

the
similarity
of
instances
simultaneously
and
utilize
the
information
entropy
approach
to
measure
the
influence
of
any
instance
exerting
on
its
neighbors
and
the
influence
of
any
feature

a
co-location
pattern

Then
an
influence
index
for
measuring
the

of
a

proposed

we
prove
the
influence

measure
satisfies
the
downward

property
that
can
be
used
for
pruning

thus
an
efficient

designed
