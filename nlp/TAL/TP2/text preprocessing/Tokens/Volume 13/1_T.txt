Bio-inspired
Computing
Theories

Application
aims
at
presenting
the
most
recent
research
and
developments
in
the
area
of
bio-inspired
intelligent
computation
based
on
the
principles
of
biological

evolutionary
algorithms

Briefly
speaking
bio-inspired
computing
methodology
is
the
use
of
computers
to
model
the
living
phenomena
and
the
study
of
life
to
improve
the
usage
of
computers

It
has
attracted
widely
theoretical
research
as
well

technological
applications

These

provide
efficient
tools
to
those
problems
which
cannot
be
solved
using
traditional
