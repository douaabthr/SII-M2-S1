The

A
fuselage

an
E190
aircraft
is
considered

the
firefly
algorithm
FA
metaheuristic
is
applied
to
solve
the
inverse
problem
in
order
to
identify
structural

location
and
severity

The
method
is
then
solved
in
two
main
fronts
1
the
direct
problem
using
finite
element
analysis
and
2
the
inverse
problem
by
minimizing
an
objective

Evaluating

It
