The
problem
of
grain
transportation
optimization
is
a
typical
NP-complete
problem

To
solve
the
problem
it
is
necessary
to
construct
a
mathematical
model
for
the
optimization
of
grain
transportation

As
the
single-objective
grain
transportation
route
optimization
model
is
difficult
to
better
simulate
the
complex
and
varied
conditions
in
real
life
the
multi-objective
grain
transportation
route
optimization
model
is
closer
to
reality
and
has
more
guiding
significance
for
practical
problems

Therefore
this

a

Second

Finally

three

conducted

In
simulation

the

The
