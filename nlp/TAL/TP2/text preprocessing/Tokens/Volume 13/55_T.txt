Various

This
paper
proposes
an
approach
for
VM
migration
in
the
cloud
using
an
optimization
algorithm
Chicken-Whale
optimization
algorithm
ChicWhale
which
is
developed
by
integrating
the
Whale
optimization
algorithm
in
Chicken
swarm
optimization

In
the
developed
approach
a
local
migration
agent
is
utilized
for
monitoring
the
memory
and
resources
utilization
in
the
cloud
continuously
and
the
VM
is
migrated
using
the
service
provider
based
on
the
requirement
of
the
VMs
to
complete
a
task
assigned

At
first
the

is
designed

then
the
proposed
ChicWhale
is
employed
by
moving
the

the
fitness

for
best
VM
migration
is
carried
out
by
considering
several
parameters
