Computational
Finance
covers
a
wide
and
still
growing
array
of
topics
and
methods
within
quantitative
economics
</s>
<s>
The
core
focus
has
long
been
on
efficient
methods
models
and
algorithms
for
numerically
demanding
problems
</s>
<s>
The
advent
of
new
computational
methods
together
with
the
advances
in
available
hardware
has
pushed
the
boundaries
of
this
field
outwards
</s>
<s>
Not
only
can
the
complexity
of
investigated
problems
be
increased
one
can
even
approach
problems
that
defy
traditional
analytical
examination
altogether
</s>
<s>
One
major
contributor
of
such
methods
is
natural
computing
.
