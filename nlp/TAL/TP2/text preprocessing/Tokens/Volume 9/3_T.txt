Signal
normalization
is
a
part
of
signal
formalization
which
is
a
vital
data
pre-processing
constraint
required
for
the
functioning
of
the
dendritic
cell
algorithm
</s>
<s>
In
existing
applications
most
normalization
algorithms
are
developed
purposely
for
a
specific
application
with
drawing
on
human
domain
expertise
and
very
few
algorithms
are
designed
for
general
problems
</s>

This
makes
it
difficult
for
the
inexperienced
user
to
exploit
existing
approaches
to
another
problem

when
the
initial

Therefore
this
study
proposes
a
new
signal
normalization
method
for
the
dendritic
cell
algorithm
that
uses
the
statistical
upper

that

In

The

Its
performance

The
results
show
