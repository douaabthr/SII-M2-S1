</s>
<s>
Selecting
and
estimating
parsimonious
models
is
often
desired
but
hard
to
achieve
</s>
<s>
This
is
particularly
true
when
models
can
potentially
contain
a
very
large
number
of
parameters
but
data
are
scarce
as
is
the
case
for
many
macro-economic
models
in
general
and
interest-rate
models
in
particular
</s>
<s>
These
models
need
to
cater
for
a
large
number
of
potential
relationships
and
dependencies
but
are
fitted
on
low-frequency
data
to
focus
on
the
bigger
picture
and
long-term
effects
</s>
<s>
To
identify
the
ideal
model
and
estimating
it
is
then
particularly
demanding
from
an
optimization
perspective
</s>
<s>
In
this
paper
we
suggest
an
evolutionary
approach
that
considers
model
selection
and
estimation
simultaneously
</s>
<s>
Numerical
experiments
with
artificial
data
suggest
that
the
approach
is
well
suited
for
this
type
of
problem

In
an
empirical
application
for
short-term
and
long-term
interest
rates
denominated
in
US
dollar
euro
and
the
Japanese
yen
respectively
parsimonious
model
structures
are
identified
that
highlight
the
dependencies
as
well
as
spill-overs
across
maturities
and
currencies
.
