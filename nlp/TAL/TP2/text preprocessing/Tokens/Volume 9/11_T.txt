Anatomy
of

<s>
Predicting
the
market
s
behavior
to
profit
from
trading
stocks
is
far
from
trivial
</s>
<s>
Such
a
task
becomes
even
harder
when
investors
do
not
have
large
amounts
of
money
available
and
thus
cannot
influence
this
complex
system
in
any
way

<s>
Machine
learning
paradigms
have
been
already
applied
to
financial
forecasting
but
usually
with
no
restrictions
on
the
size

s
budget

In
this
paper
we
analyze
an
evolutionary
portfolio
optimizer
for
the
management
of
limited
budgets
dissecting
each
part
of
the
framework
discussing
in
detail
the
issues
and
the
motivations
that
led
to
the
final
choices

Expected
returns
are
modeled
resorting
to
artificial
