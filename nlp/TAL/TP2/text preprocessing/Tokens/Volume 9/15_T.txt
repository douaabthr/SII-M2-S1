This
paper
presents
an
evolutionary
approach
that
given
a
performance
goal
produces
a
communication
strategy
that
can
improve
a
multi-agent
system
s
performance
with
respect
to
the
desired
goal
</s>
<s>
The
evolved
strategy
determines
what
when
and
to
whom
agents
communicate
</s>
<s>
The
proposed
approach
further
enables
tuning
the
trade-off
between
the
performance
goal
and
communication
cost
to
produce
a
strategy
that
achieves
a
good
balance
between
the
two
objectives
according
the
system
s
designer
needs

<s>
Experiments
are
designed
to
evaluate
the
approach
using
the
Wumpus
World
application
domain
with
variations
of
three
factors
fitness
parameters
including
objectives
weights
and
action
and
communication
costs
fitness
goal
and
simulation
environment

<s>
Results
show
that
the
system
s
performance
can
be
highly
tuned
by
controlling
communication
and
that
the
presented
approach
has
significant
utilization
in
improving
the
performance
with
respect
to
the
