This
study
presents
a
new
metaheuristic
optimization
algorithm
named
Tree
Optimization
Algorithm
TOA
for
solving
mathematical
benchmark
functions
and
engineering
problems
</s>
<s>
This
algorithm
which
is
inspired
from
the
growth
of
trees
starts
from
a
random
initial
population
and
improves
their
performance
according
to
the
growth
pattern
of
trees
</s>
<s>
Indeed
the
purpose
of
this
new
optimization
method
is
to
find
the
highest
leaf
of
a
tree
by
utilizing
the
position
of
the
best
leaf
and
also
replacing
yellow
dried
leaves
by
new
random
fresh
green
ones
</s>
<s>
These
strategies
prevent
the
algorithm
from
the
premature
convergence
and
getting
stuck
in
local
minima
</s>
<s>
This
modern
optimization
method
is
evaluated
by
solving
several
mathematical
test
functions
and
a
real
world
constrained
design
problem

<s>
The
obtained
results
are
compared
with
those
of
some
prominent
evolutionary
algorithms
introduced
in
the
literature
</s>
<s>
The
numerical
and
simulation
results
verify
the
superiority
of
the
TOA
in
terms
of
the
solution
accuracy
and
the
