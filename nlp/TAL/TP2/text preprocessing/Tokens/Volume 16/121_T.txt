The
purpose
of
speaker
recognition
is
to
use
speaker
s
voice
characteristics
to
identify
the
speaker
s
identity
</s>
<s>
No
two
people
in
the
world
have
exactly
the
same
voice
characteristics
because
from
the
perspective
of
the
human
physiological
structure
different
people
s
vocal
shapes
throat
sizes
and
other
factors
related
to
pronunciation
are
different
which
makes
it
possible
to
recognize
speech
by
speech
</s>

From
the
technology
level
the
proposed
framework
contains
the
four
core
aspects
namely
speaker
identification
motion
gesture
detection
heart
rate
detection
and
breath
detection
