BackgroundThe
COVID-19
pandemic
has
badly
affected
people
of
all
ages
globally
</s>
<s>
Therefore
its
vaccine
has
been
developed
and
made
available
for
public
use
in
unprecedented
times
</s>
<s>
However
because
of
various
levels
of
hesitancy
it
did
not
have
general
acceptance
</s>
<s>
The
main
objective
of
this
work
is
to
identify
the
risk
associated
with
the
COVID-19
vaccines
by
developing
a
prognosis
tool
that
will
help
in
enhancing
its
acceptability
and
therefore
reducing
the
lethality
of
SARS-CoV-2
.
Methods
The
obtained
raw
VAERS
dataset
has
three
files
indicating
medical
history
vaccination
status
and
post
vaccination
symptoms
respectively
with
more
than
354
thousand
samples
</s>

After
pre-processing
this
raw
dataset
has
been
merged
into
one
with
85
different
attributes
however
the
whole
analysis
has
been
subdivided
into
three
scenarios
i
medical
history
ii

Also
the

LGBM
have
been
utilized
to
estimate
the

that
resulted

COVID-19

Results
For
the
above
mentioned
scenarios
all

as

Cancer

</s>
<s>
Further
for
prediction
LGBM
outperforms
all
the
other
developed
models
in
most
of
the
scenarios

LR

NB

perform
satisfactorily
in

Conclusion
The
male
population
in
the
age
group
of
50
70
has
been
found
most
susceptible
to
this
virus
</s>
<s>
Also
people
with
existing
serious
illnesses
have
been
found
most
vulnerable
</s>
<s>
Therefore
they
must
be
vaccinated
in
close
observations
</s>
<s>
Generally
no
serious
adverse
effect
of
the
vaccine
has
been
observed
therefore
people
must
vaccinate
themselves
without
any
hesitation
at
the
earliest
</s>
<s>
Also
the
model
developed
using
LGBM
establishes
its
supremacy
over
all
the
other

<s>
Therefore
it
can
be
very
helpful
for
the
policymakers
in
administrating

prioritizing
the
population

the
different
vaccination
programs
