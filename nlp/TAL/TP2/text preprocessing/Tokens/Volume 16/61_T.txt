Swarm
based
algorithms
play
a
very
important
role
in
solving
optimization
problems
as
these
algorithms
perform
better
than
the

techniques

Various
such

are
developed

experimented
with
by
previous
researchers

However
the

In
this

a

algorithm
called
Termite
Alate
Optimization
Algorithm
TAOA
is
proposed
based
on
the

The
advantage
of
this

is
its
faster
convergence

effective
exploration

exploitation
capability

The
algorithm
also
has
a
moderate

To
evaluate

Apart

Finally
a
comparison
between
