A

<s>
This
paper
proposes
a
new
hybrid
algorithm
that
merges
the
main
features
of
two
well-known
metaheuristic
algorithms
Grasshopper
Optimization
Algorithm
GOA
and
Antlion
Optimization
ALO
algorithm
</s>
<s>
ALO
is
strong
in
exploitation
due
to
the
mechanism
of
antlions
in
hunting
other
insects
</s>
<s>
On
the
other
hand
the
social
forces
in
GOA
represent
the
strong
capability
of
exploration
all
over
the
search
space
</s>
<s>
So
these
features
give
the
chance
to
combine
ALO
and
GOA
in
one
hybrid
algorithm
that
significantly
enhances
the
performance
of
both
methods
</s>
<s>
The
proposed
hybrid
algorithm
is
tested
on
32
well-known
benchmark
test
functions
13
functions
of
the
challenging
CEC2015
functions
and
two
real
problems
in
antenna
array
synthesis
where
the
elements
excitation
amplitudes
and
phases
are
optimized
to
minimize
the
maximum
sidelobe
level
and
impose
nulls
at
specific
angles
</s>
<s>
Comparisons
show
that
the
proposed
algorithm
outperforms
18
well-known
optimization
methods
including
ALO
and
GOA
in
the
majority
of
these
tests
with
huge
differences
in
some
of
them
which
prove
the
stability
robustness
and
efficiency
of
the
proposed
method
over
other
robust
algorithms
.
