This

adapts
a
hybrid
genetic
algorithm
to
estimate
the
main
parameters
of
the
network

The
proposed
method
utilizes
a
genetic
algorithm
in
a
conjunction
with
a
local
search
procedure
and
a
termination
rule
</s>
<s>
The
method
is
tested
against
other
RBF
variants
on
a
series
of
well-known
problems
from
the
relevant
literature
and
the
results
are
reported
.
