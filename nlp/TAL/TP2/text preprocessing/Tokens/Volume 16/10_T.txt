This

proposes
a
new
multi-objective
algorithm
called
Multi-Objective
Marine-Predator
Algorithm
MOMPA
dependent
on
elitist
non-dominated
sorting
and
crowding
distance
mechanism
</s>

The
proposed
algorithm
is
based
on
the
recently
proposed
Marine-Predator
Algorithm
and
it
was
inspired
by
biological
interaction
between
predator
and
prey

The
proposed
MOMPA
can
address
multiple

conflicting
objectives

The
MOMPA

formulated
using
elitist
