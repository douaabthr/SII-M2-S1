In

Finally

two
contracts

designed
3PL

combination
contract

It
is
found
that
the
retailer
with
fairness

sets
lower

price

3PL

<s>
The
retailer
s
fairness
concern
is
not
conducive
to
the
manufacturer
the
3PL
supplier
and
the
whole
supply
chain

beneficial
to
the
retailer

<s>
In
addition
both
these
two
contracts
improve
the
performance

chain

environmental
benefits

Compared
with
the
3PL
green
cost
sharing
contract
the
combination
contract
plays
a
more
significant
role
in
making
more
profit
for
the
3PL
supplier
and
more
utility
for
the
retailer
