Pricing

<s>
The
empty
equipment
repositioning
EER
problem
is
deemed
an
inefficiency
of
the
marine
industry
</s>
<s>
However
owing
to
trade
imbalance
as
the
fundamental
cause
of
EER
such
problem
is
inevitable
and
requires
consideration
in
pricing
decisions

Accordingly
this
study
explores
a
marine
service
chain
with
one
carrier
and
two
dominant
forwarders
providing
transportation
service
between
two
ports
</s>
<s>
We
built
a
mathematical
model
to
examine
how
carrier
and
forwarders
determine
pricing
decisions
with
and
without
EER
cost
sharing
</s>
<s>
We
find
that
the
smaller
one
between
empty
equipment
balancing
and
EER
costs
determines
pricing
decisions
</s>
<s>
We
also
investigate
whether
the
EER
cost-sharing
mechanism
can
coordinate
the
service
chain
and
subsequently
found
that
the
EER
cost-sharing
mechanism
aggravates
double
marginalization
</s>
<s>
Then
we
design
a
two-part
tariff
coordination
mechanism
to
coordinate
the
service
chain
</s>
<s>
Lastly
we
study
the
effect
of
EER
cost
sharing
and
coordination
mechanism
on
the
environment
</s>
<s>
Interestingly
we
find
that
EER
cost-sharing
and
coordination
should
be
avoided
from
the
perspective
of
environmental
protection
