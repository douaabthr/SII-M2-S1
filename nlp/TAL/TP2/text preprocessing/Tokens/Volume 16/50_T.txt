A

</s>
<s>
We
propose
an
online
learning
model
that
efficiently
teaches
a
defender
s
agent
to
learn
the
attacker
s
behavior
while
interacting
in
the
cyber-world
</s>
<s>
This
paper
models
the
interaction
between
these
two
agents
as
a
stochastic
game
with
limited
rationality
</s>
<s>
Because
of
this
limited
rationality
the
proposed
model
helps
the
defender
s
agent
learn
the
unknown
communicator
s
behavior
from
the
feedback
obtained
while
interacting
with
it
</s>
<s>
Many
models
are
built
to
solve
the
interaction
between
them
by
developing
a
state-oriented
stochastic
Markov
game
</s>
<s>
However
such
models
fail
due
to
the
state
explosion
problem
and
therefore
this
paper
discusses
a
model
to
solve
this
game
restricting
it
to
a
stateless
stochastic
game
</s>
<s>
The
model
is
then
compared
to
check
the
performance
with
different
algorithms
that
solve
stochastic
games

<s>
The
comparison
between
them
shows
that
the
proposed
algorithm
converges
to
an
optimal
strategy
in
a
brief
simulation
time
span
</s>
<s>
Finally
our
model
checks
the
performance
with
an
existing
technique
that
shows
that
the
proposed
algorithm
chooses
the
correct
strategy
for
around
91%
of
the
simulation
time
compared
to
73%
of
the
simulation
time
by
the
existing
