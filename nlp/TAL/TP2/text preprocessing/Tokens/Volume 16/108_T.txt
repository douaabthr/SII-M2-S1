One
of
the
main
challenges
of
the
CC
is
how
to
allocate
computational
resources
to
subcomponents
reasonably
</s>
<s>
Therefore
a
new
adaptive
computing
resource
allocation
mechanism
ACRA
is
proposed
in
this
paper
</s>
<s>
ACRA
defines
the
average
value
of
the
relative
change
rate
of
the
original
problem
after
each
round
of
optimization
as
the
contribution
rate
of
the
subcomponent
so
that
the
optimization
information
of
each
round
can
be
effectively
used
</s>
<s>
ACRA
also
sets
a
new
threshold
when
the
random
number
is
greater
than
the
threshold
the
subcomponent
with
the
largest
contribution
rate
is
selected
for
optimization
otherwise
a
subcomponent
is
randomly
selected
for
optimization
</s>
<s>
In
the
early
stage
of
optimization
such
a
subcomponent
selection
strategy
will
try
to
select
the
subcomponents
with
a
large
average
contribution
rate
for
optimization
to
speed
up
the
decline
of
the
objective
function
while
in
the
later
stage
of
optimization
all
components
will
be
selected
on
average
to
improve
the
computing
resources
in
the
later
stage

Finally
the
algorithm
proposed
in
this

is
compared
with
other
algorithms
on
