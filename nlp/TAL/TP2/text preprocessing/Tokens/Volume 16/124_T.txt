Disparity-augmented

Numerous
methods
for
human
activity
recognition
HAR
have
been
proposed
in
the
past
two
decades
</s>
<s>
Many
of
these
methods
are
based
on
sparse
representations
which
describe
the
whole
video
content
by
a
set
of
local
features
</s>
<s>
Trajectories
as
mid-level
sparse
features
are
capable
of
describing
the
movements
of
interest
points
in
two-dimensional
2D
space

<s>
However
2D
trajectories
might
be
affected
by
viewpoint
changes
potentially
decreasing
their
accuracies

<s>
In
this
paper
we
first
propose
and
compare
different
2D
trajectory-based
algorithms
for
human
activity
recognition
</s>
<s>
Then
we
propose
a
new
way
of
augmenting
2D
trajectories
with
disparity
information
without
the
calculation
of
the
3D
reconstruction
</s>
<s>
Our
obtained
HAR
results
have
shown
a
2.76%
improvement
when
using
disparity-augmented
trajectories
compared
to
using
classical
2D
trajectory
information
only
</s>
<s>
Furthermore
we
have
also
tested
our
method
on
the
challenging
Hollywood
3D
dataset
on
which
we
have
obtained
competitive
results
at
a
much
faster
speed
.
