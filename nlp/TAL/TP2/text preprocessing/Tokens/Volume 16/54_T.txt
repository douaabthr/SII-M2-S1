Evolutionary
approaches
for
the
weighted
anti-covering
location
problem
</s>
<s>
Given
a
set
of
potential
facility
location
sites
along
with
a
positive
weight
associated
with
each
site
as
per
its
importance
the
anti-covering
location
problem
ACLP
is
about
locating
a
set
of
facilities
at
some
of
these
potential
locations
such
that
no
two
facilities
are
closer
than
a
given
distance
from
each
other
and
sum
of
weights
of
chosen
locations
is
as
large
as
possible
</s>

This
mathcal
NP
hard
problem
has
several
important
real-world
applications
such
as
telecommunications
equipment
siting
locating
military
units
locating
franchise
outlets
locating

forest
management

DNA

The

ACLP
is
widely
studied
in
the
literature

However
the
weighted
version
did
not
receive
much
attention

In
this
paper
we
have
proposed
two
evolutionary
approaches
based
on
genetic
algorithm
GA
and
discrete
differential
evolution
DDE
to
solve
the
weighted
version
of
the
ACLP

The
proposed

are
used
to
solve
