Heart
failure
HF
is
a
clinical
syndrome
that
disables
the
heart
from
pumping
blood
to
effectively
nourish
the
body
or
does
it
to
elevated
intracardiac
pressures
</s>
<s>
Currently
the
main
diagnostic
methods
for
this
pathology
are
performed
clinically
by
the
measurement
of
biomarkers
such
as
B-type
natriuretic
peptide
BNP
and
by
cardiac
imaging
methods
</s>
<s>
As
cardiovascular
diseases
are
the
primary
causes
of
premature
death
new
technologies
to
identify
these
diseases
at
an
early
stage
are
of
great
importance
</s>
<s>
Thus
this
research
presents
the
development
of
two
artificial
neural
networks
ANNs
one
for
each
gender
that
recognize
the
vocal
distortions
caused
by
HF
in
an
individual
</s>
<s>
Therefore
the
voices
of
142
individuals
were
collected
separated
by
sex
and
age
</s>
<s>
Among
these
142
84
voices
of
people
already
diagnosed
with
HF
were
collected
at
the
Heart
Institute
of
Sao
Paulo
University
INCOR
USP
and
the
Metropolitan
Hospital
of
Paraiba
</s>
<s>
Also
the
voices
of
58
healthy
individuals
were
collected
in
an
extra-hospital
environment
</s>
<s>
Then
the
following
techniques
were
applied
to
extract
the
signals
features
statistical
analysis
FFT
discrete
wavelet
transform
and
Mel-Cepstral
analysis
</s>
<s>
The
selected
features
were
used
to
develop
ANNs
that
aim
to
identify
HF
</s>
<s>
Both
ANNs
achieved
an
efficiency
of
96.7%
</s>
<s>
Also
values
of
91.86%
88.1%
and
92.1%
were
obtained
for
accuracy
sensitivity
and
specificity
respectively
</s>
<s>
Therefore
comparing
the
results
reached
by
this
research
to
other
studies
in
the
field
it
is
possible
to
conclude
that
the
use
of
voice
analysis
represents
a
great
improvement
in
HF
recognition
and
early
treatment
.
