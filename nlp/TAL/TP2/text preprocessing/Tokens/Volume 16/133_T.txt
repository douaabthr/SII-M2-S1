<s>
Visible
and
infrared
images
are
important
ways
for
the
power
inspection
robot
to
detect
the
status
of
power
equipment
</s>
<s>
Image
registration
can
make
full
use
of
the
advantages
of
the
visible
and
infrared
images
which
can
provide
a
better
basis
for
subsequent
state
monitoring
</s>
<s>
Traditional
registration
methods
have
the
low
and
poor
registration
accuracy
caused
by
infrared
image
blurring
</s>
<s>
Therefore
a
new
chaos
cat
swarm
optimization
algorithm
based
on
saliency
gradient
is
proposed
to
improve
the
registration
accuracy
</s>
<s>
Firstly
based
on
the
visual
saliency
detection
of
infrared
images
the
edge

information
of
saliency

is
enhanced

Secondly
the
saliency
gradient
information
and
the
normalized
mutual
information
are
combined
as
the
measurement
function

<s>
Thirdly
a
new
chaos

optimization
algorithm
is
proposed
to
improve
the
convergence

the
image

<s>
It
uses
different
chaotic

improve
the

</s>
<s>
Logistic
chaos
mapping
is
used
in
the
algorithm
to
change
the
location
information
of
the
cat
population
in
each
iteration
process
to
avoid
the
local
optimal
problem
so
that
the
whole
population
can
reach
a
balance
between
the
global
search
ability
and
the
local
search
ability
which
has
a
good
convergence
speed

Finally

The
