Towards
fair
machine
learning
using
combinatorial
methods
</s>
<s>
With
the
rise
of
artificial
intelligence
and
machine
learning
in
the
last
decade
there
has
been
an
increasing
interest
in
developing
a
solid
theory
and
implementing
algorithmic
fairness
which
has
eventually
resulted
in
a
large
volume
of
work
over
the
past
few
years
</s>
<s>
Despite
the
enormous
amount
of
work
done
on
the
topic
over
a
concise
period
there
has
been
little
consensus
of
a
unifying
theory
of
algorithmic
fairness
</s>
<s>
In
this
paper
we
develop
a
notion
of
fairness
that
is
based
on
the
notion
of
discrepancy
of
set
systems
a
widely
studied
topic
in
the
theory
of
computer
science
and
combinatorics
