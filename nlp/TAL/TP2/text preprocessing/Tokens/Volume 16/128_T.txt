This

presents
a
multi-objective

MO

Unlike

just
the
accuracy

extensibility
of
the

the
core
the
proposed

focuses
on
searching
the

In

The
first

consisting

aims
at

The
main
ideas
of
the
MO
TPS
are
to
utilize
the
evolution
of
two
groups
of
cells
with
different
functions
in
the
tissue
P
system
for
searching
the
boundaries
of
solution
sets
obtaining
solution
sets
which
are
uniformly

have
better
extensibility
and
approaching
to
the
Pareto
front
on
the
premise
of
preserving
the
elite
