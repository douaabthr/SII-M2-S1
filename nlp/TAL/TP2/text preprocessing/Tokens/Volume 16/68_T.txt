In

an

proposed

Our
EM-BT
algorithm
uses
the
same
concept
of
the
BitTorrent
communication
protocol
to
ameliorate
the
communication
between
the
candidate
solutions
and
manage
the
way
information
is
exchanged
between
them
in
order
to
provide
sufficient
exploration
and
exploitation
of
the
search
space
