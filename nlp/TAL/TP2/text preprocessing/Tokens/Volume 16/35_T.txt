Water
cycle
algorithm
WCA
is
a
recent
meta-heuristic
algorithm
presented
to
solve
various
optimization
problems
</s>
<s>
WCA
has
received
critical
intrigued
from
researchers
in
different
fields
</s>
<s>
Nevertheless
the
search
equation
provided
in
WCA
is
not
of
adequate
explorative
behavior
</s>
<s>
In
this
study
a
reconfigured
version
of
the
WCA
is
proposed
the
proposed
algorithm
is
named
as
RWCA
</s>

So
as
to
improve
the
exploration
procedure
a
new
position
update
strategy
is
proposed
by
integrating
cauchy
operator
and
a
greedy
selection
procedure
</s>

Furthermore
in
order
to
promote
the
exploration-exploitation
balance
of
the
RWCA
algorithm
a
nonlinear

is
proposed

The
performance

RWCA
is

<s>
Statistical
analysis
proves
that
RWCA
significantly
improves
the
performance
of
basic
WCA

faster

Moreover
RWCA
has
been
used
to
solve
five

Based
on
the
experiments

comparative
findings
RWCA
illustrates
the
adequacy

to
solve
