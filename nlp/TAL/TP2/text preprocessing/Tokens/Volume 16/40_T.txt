Every
day
millions
of
skin
and
acne
face
images
are
generated
all
around
the
world
and
compression
is
the
inevitability
of
all
such
types
of
images

Acne
images
suffer
from
the
problem

Both
Peak

In
this
paper
a
new
algorithm

compression

proposed

The
Proposed
algorithm
works
in
such
a
way
that
even
a
highly
compressed
image
would
retain
all
the
mandatory
information
since
the
region
of
interest
that
is
necessary
for
diagnosis
retains
a
significant
quality
and
is
compressed
to
an
optimal
level
