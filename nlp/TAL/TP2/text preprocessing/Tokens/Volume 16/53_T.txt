The
Flower
Pollination
Algorithm
FPA
is
a
highly
efficient
optimization
algorithm
that
is
inspired
by
the
evolution
process
of
flowering
plants
</s>
<s>
In
the
present
study
a
modified
version
of
FPA
is
proposed
accounting
for
an
additional
feature
of
flower
pollination
in
nature
that
is
the
so-called
pollinator
attraction
</s>
<s>
Pollinator
attraction
represents
the
natural
tendency
of
flower
species
to
evolve
in
order
to
attract
pollinators
by
using
their
colour
shape
and
scent
as
well
as
nutritious
rewards
</s>
<s>
To
reflect
this
evolution
mechanism
the
proposed
FPA
variant
with
Pollinator
Attraction
FPAPA
provides
fitter
flowers
of
the
population
with
higher
probabilities
of
achieving
pollen
transfer
via
biotic
pollination
than
other
flowers
</s>
<s>
FPAPA
is
tested
against
a
set
of
28
benchmark
mathematical
functions
defined
in
IEEE-CEC
13
for
real-parameter
single-objective
optimization
problems
as
well
as
structural
optimization
problems
</s>
<s>
Numerical
experiments
show
that
the
modified
FPA
represents
a
statistically
significant
improvement
upon
the
original
FPA
and
that
it
can
outperform
other
state-of-the-art
optimization
algorithms
offering
better
and
more
robust
optimal
solutions
</s>
<s>
Additional
research
is
suggested
to
combine
FPAPA
with
other
modified
and
hybridized
versions
of
FPA
to
further
increase
its
performance
in
challenging
optimization
