Since

work
involves
many
fields

each
field
examines
the

translators
they

In

we
propose
an
English

model
based
on

First

use

Second
in
the
process
of
generating
the
target
sequence
by
dynamically
selecting
the
background
vector
the
translation
model
pays
more
attention
to
the
parts
with
high
correlation
with
the
source
language
during
the
translation
process
thereby
improving
the
translation
performance
of
the
model

<s>
Third
we
design
a
multi-feature
fusion
method
for
automatic
identification
of
English

errors
to
improve

Finally
we
experimentally
demonstrate
that

proposed

has
good
