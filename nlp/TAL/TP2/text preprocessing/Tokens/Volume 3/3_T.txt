This
paper
introduces
a
new
variety
of
learning
classifier
system
LCS
called
MILCS
which
utilizes
mutual
information
as
fitness
feedback
</s>
<s>
Unlike
most
LCSs
MILCS
is
specifically
designed
for
supervised
learning

<s>
We
present
experimental
results
and
contrast
them
to
results
from
XCS
UCS
GAssist

<s>
MILCS
is
also
shown
to
promote
the
discovery
ofdefault

an
important
advantage
of
LCSs
