In
mobile
robotics
a
solid
test
for
adaptation
is
the
ability
of
a
control
system
to
function
not
only
in
a
diverse
number
of
physical
environments
but
also
on
a
number
of
different
robotic
platforms

This
paper
demonstrates
that
a
set
of
behaviours
evolved
in
simulation
on
a
miniature
robot
epuck
can
be
transferred
to
a
much
larger-scale
platform
Pioneer
both
in
simulation
and
in
the
real
world
</s>

The
chosen
architecture
uses
artificial
evolution
of
epuck
behaviours
to
obtain
a
genetic
sequence
which
is
then
employed
to
seed
an
idiotypic
artificial
immune
system
AIS
on
the
Pioneers
</s>
<s>
Despite
numerous
hardware
and
software
differences
between
the
platforms
navigation
and
target-finding
experiments
show
that
the
evolved
behaviours
transfer
very
well
to
the
larger
robot
when
the
idiotypic
AIS
technique
is
used
</s>
<s>
In
contrast
transferability
is
poor
when
reinforcement
learning
alone
is
used
which
validates
the
adaptability
of
the
chosen
architecture
