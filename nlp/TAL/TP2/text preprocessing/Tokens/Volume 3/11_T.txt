Composition
of
web
services
through
genetic
programming
</s>
<s>
Web
Services
are
interfaces
that
describe
a
collection
of
operations
that
are
network-accessible
through
standardized
web
protocols
</s>
<s>
When
a
required
operation
is
not
found
several
services
can
be
compounded
to
get
a
composite
service
that
performs
the
desired
task
</s>
<s>
To
find
this
composite
service
a
search
process
in
a
generally
huge
search
space
must
be
performed
</s>
<s>
The
algorithm
that
composes
the
services
must
select
the
adequate
atomic
processes
and
also
must
choose
the
correct
way
to
combine
them
using
the
different
available
control
structures
</s>
<s>
In
this
paper
a
genetic
programming
algorithm
for
web
services
composition
is
presented
</s>
<s>
The
algorithm
has
a
context-free
grammar
to
generate
the
valid
structures
of
the
composite
services
and
also
it
includes
a
method
to
update
the
attributes
of
each
node
</s>
<s>
Moreover
the
proposal
tries
to
minimize
the
number
of
services
and
looks
for
compositions
with
the
minimum
execution
path
</s>
<s>
A
full
experimental
validation
with
four
different
repositories
with
up
to
1,090
web
services
has
been
done
showing
a
great
performance
in
all
the
tests
as
the
algorithm
finds
a
valid
solution
with
a
short
execution
path
.
