An
interdisciplinary
perspective

artificial
immune
systems

This
review
paper
attempts
to
position
the
area
of
Artificial
Immune
Systems
AIS
in
a
broader
context
of
interdisciplinary
research
</s>
<s>
We
review
AIS
based
on
an
established
conceptual
framework
that
encapsulates
mathematical
and
computational
modelling
of
immunology
abstraction
and
then
development
of
engineered
systems
</s>
<s>
We
argue
that
AIS
are
much
more
than
engineered
systems
inspired
by
the
immune
system
and
that
there
is
a
great
deal
for
both
immunology
and
engineering
to
learn
from
each
other
through
working
in
an
interdisciplinary
manner
.
