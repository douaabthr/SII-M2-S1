The
dendritic
cell
algorithm
DCA
has
been
applied
successfully
to
a
diverse
range
of
applications
</s>
<s>
These
applications
are
related
by
the
inherent
uncertainty
associated
with
sensing
the
application
environment
</s>
<s>
The
DCA
has
performed
well
using
unfiltered
signals
from
each
environment
as
inputs
</s>
<s>
In
this
paper
we
demonstrate
that
the
DCA
has
an
emergent
filtering
mechanism
caused
by
the
manner
in
which
the
cell
accumulates
its
internal
variables

Furthermore
we
demonstrate
a
relationship
between
the
migration
threshold
of
the
cells
and
the
transfer
function
of
the
algorithm

<s>
A
tuning
methodology
is
proposed
and
a
robotic
application
published
previously
is
revisited
using
the
new
tuning
technique
