Four
binary-encoded
models
describing
some
aspects
of
the
phylogenetics
evolution
in
an
artificial
immune
system
have
been
proposed
and
analyzed
</s>
<s>
The
first
model
has
focused
on
the
evolution
of
a
paratope
s
population
considering
a
fixed
group
of
epitopes
to
simulate
a
hypermutation
mechanism
and
observe
how
the
system
would
self-adjust
to
cover
the
epitopes
</s>
<s>
In
the
second
model
the
evolution
involves
a
group
of
antibodies
adapting
to
a
given
antigenic
molecules
population
</s>
<s>
The
third
model
simulated
the
coevolution
between
antibodies
generating
gene
libraries
and
antigens
</s>
<s>
The
objective
was
to
simulate
somatic

mechanisms

obtain
final
libraries
apt
to
produce
antibodies
to
cover
any
possible
antigen
that
would
appear
in
the
pathogens
population
</s>
<s>
In
the
fourth
model
the
coevolution
involves
a
new
population
of
self-molecules

function
was
to
establish
