Improving
the
reliability
of
real-time
embedded
systems
using
innate
immune
techniques
</s>
<s>
Previous
work
has
shown
that
immune-inspired
techniques
have
good
potential
for
solving
problems
associated
with
the
development
of
real-time
embedded
systems
RTES
where
for
various
reasons
traditional
real-time
development
techniques
are
not
suitable

This
paper
examines
in
more
detail
the
general
applicability
of
the
Dendritic
Cell
Algorithm
DCA
to
the
problem
of
task
scheduling
in
RTES
</s>
<s>
To
make
this
possible
an
understanding
of
the
problem
characteristics
is
formalised
such
that
the
results
produced
by
the
DCA
can
be
examined
in
relation
to
the
overall
problem
difficulty
</s>
<s>
The
paper
then
contains
a
detailed
understanding
of
how
well
the
DCA
which
demonstrates
that
it
generally
performs
well
however
it
clearly
identifies
properties
of
anomalies
that
are
difficult
to
detect
</s>
<s>
These
properties
are
as
anticipated
based
on
real-time
scheduling
theory
