The

algorithm
DCA
is
an
immune-inspired
algorithm
developed
for
the
purpose
of
anomaly
detection

The
algorithm
performs
multi-sensor
data
fusion
and

results
in

system

Previous
applications
of
the
DCA
have
included
the
detection
of
potentially
malicious
port
scanning
activity
where
it
has
produced
high
rates
of
true

and
low
rates
of
false
positives

In
this
work
we
aim
to
compare
the
performance

the
DCA

of
a
self-organizing

SOM

applied
to
the
detection
of
SYN

A
SOM
is
an
ideal
candidate
for
comparison
as
it
shares
similarities
with
the
DCA
in

of
the
data

method
employed

It
is
shown
that
the
results
of
the
two
systems
are
comparable

both
produce
false

This
shows
that
the
DCA
can
produce
anomaly

results
to
the
