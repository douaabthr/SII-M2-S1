XCS
is
an
accuracy-based
learning
classifier
system
which
has
been
successfully
applied
to
learn
various
classification
and
function
approximation
problems

<s>
Recently
it
has
been
reported
that
XCS
cannot
learn
overlapping
and
niche
imbalance
problems
using
the
typical
experimental
setup
</s>
<s>
This
paper
describes
two
approaches
to
learn
these
complex
problems
firstly
tune
the
parameters
and
adjust
the
methods
of
standard
XCS
specifically
for
such
problems
</s>

Secondly
apply
an
advanced
variation
of
XCS
</s>
<s>
Specifically
we
developed
previously
an
XCS
with
code-fragment
actions
named
XCSCFA
which
has
a
more
flexible
genetic
programming
like
encoding
and
explicit
state-action
mapping
through
computed
actions
</s>
<s>
This
approach
is
examined
and
compared
with
standard
XCS
on
six
complex
Boolean
datasets
which
include
overlapping
and
niche
imbalance
problems
</s>
<s>
The
results
indicate
that
to
learn
overlapping
and
niche
imbalance
problems
using
XCS
it
is
beneficial
to
either
deactivate
action
set
subsumption
or
use
a
relatively
high
subsumption
threshold
and
a
small
error
threshold
</s>
<s>
The
XCSCFA
approach
successfully
solved
the
tested
complex
overlapping
and
niche
imbalance
problems
without
parameter
tuning
because
of
the
rich
alphabet
inconsistent
actions
and
especially
the
redundancy
provided
by
the
code-fragment
actions
