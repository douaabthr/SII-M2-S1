Recently
self

classifiers
were
proposed
which
are
similar
to
LCSs

have
the
advantage
that
in
its
structured
population
no
balance
between
niching
and
fitness
pressure
is
necessary

more
tests

Here
a
variation
of
the

proposed

uses
a

SOM

This
algorithm
is
applied
in
challenging
problems
such
as

as

as

mazes
growing

are

Moreover
a
genetic

proposed

utilizes

Thus
the
first

are
shown
nonetheless
the
problems
faced
are
more
difficult
