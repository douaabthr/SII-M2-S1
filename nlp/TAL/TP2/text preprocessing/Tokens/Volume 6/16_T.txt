New

<s>
This
paper
presents
and
compares
several
evolutionary
solutions
for
the
well-known
MasterMind
game
a
classic
board
game
invented
in
the
1970s
</s>
<s>
First
we
propose
a
novel
evolutionary
approach
which
we
callnested
hierarchical
evolutionary
search
to
solve
the
MasterMind
game
comparing
the
obtained
results
with
that
of
existing
algorithms
</s>
<s>
Second
we
show
how
to
design
novel
game
anticipation
strategies
for
the
MasterMind
game
by
applying
genetic
programming
</s>
<s>
In
this
case
we
compare
the
performance
of
the
new
obtained
strategies
with
that
of
the
classical
ones
obtaining
advantages
in
all
the
cases
tested
