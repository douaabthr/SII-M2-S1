This

introduces
a
unique
Birds
of
Prey-Based
Optimization
BPBO
algorithm
which
was
influenced
by
the
astute
hunting
techniques
of
predatory
birds
</s>
<s>
The
approach
utilizes
both
individual
and
group
hunting
techniques
while
selectively
targeting
weaker
birds
to
effectively
balance
exploration
and
exploitation
strategies
</s>
<s>
By
incorporating
a
dynamic
relocation
strategy
to
access
more
suitable
prey
this
method
enhances
population
diversity
and
mitigates
the
risk
of
premature
convergence
</s>
<s>
The
integration
of
these
strategies
in
light
of
the
ongoing
dynamic
shifts
enables
the
BPBO
algorithm
to
effectively
address
a
wide
range
of
problems
