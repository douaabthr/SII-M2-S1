The
multiple
traveling
salesman
problem
mTSP
is
an
extension
of
the
traveling
salesman
problem
which
involves
multiple
salespeople
visiting
a
set
of
cities
with
each
city
being
visited
only
once

It
is
widely
used
in
logistics
distribution

scheduling
and
multi

collaboration

faces
challenges
such
as
high

difficult
task
