This
study
presents
the

Combined
Arms
GCA
algorithm
a
novel
metaheuristic
approach
inspired
by
military
strategies
designed
to
address
high-dimensional
and
complex
optimization
challenges
in
engineering
</s>
<s>
The
algorithm
employs
a
dual-agent
strategy
by
dividing
search
agents
into
two
coordinated
groups
ground
forces
for
intensively
refining
solutions
within
promising
regions
and
air
forces
for
extensively
exploring
the
search
space
to
avoid
local
optima

By
integrating
Gaussian

principles
the
GCA
algorithm
dynamically
balances
exploration
and
exploitation
ensuring
adaptability
and
efficiency
across
diverse
optimization
landscapes
