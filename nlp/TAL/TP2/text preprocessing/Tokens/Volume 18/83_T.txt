This
paper
presents
a
novel
metaheuristic
algorithm
aimed
at
addressing
the
inefficiencies
of
conventional
approaches
that
use
a
single
operator
and
unique
population
to
handle
both
exploration
and
exploitation
</s>
<s>
To
achieve
a
more
effective
search
process
the
algorithm
introduces
a
structured
population
that
is
divided
into
two
distinct
groups
explorers
XPL
and
exploiters
EXP
.
XPL
agents
perform
global
exploration
by
following
complex
trajectories
generated
from
randomly
selected
Bézier
functions
promoting
diverse
and
comprehensive
coverage
of
the
search
space
</s>
<s>
In
contrast
the
EXP
agents
are
responsible
for
local
refinement
updating
their
positions
through
a
specialized
hexagonal
crossover
operator
</s>
<s>
This
operator
generates
new
candidate
solutions
within
a
hexagon-shaped
region
by
incorporating
information
from
other
high-quality
individuals
in
the
population
</s>
<s>
By
integrating
these
two
mechanisms
each
dedicated
to
either
exploration
or
exploitation
the
algorithm
enhances
its
ability
to
focus
on
promising
regions
while
maintaining
global
diversity
</s>
<s>
The
proposed
method
was
compared
with
several
state-of-the-art
metaheuristics
using
a
suite
of
shifted
functions
specifically
designed
to
challenge
center-biased
strategies
</s>
<s>
The
experimental
results
demonstrate
that
the
algorithm
consistently
produces
a
superior
solution
quality
and
faster
convergence
while
effectively
avoiding
the
typical
flaws
of
center-biased
methods
