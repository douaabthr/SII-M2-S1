<s>
This
study
proposes
a
metaheuristic
named
ABC-GA-QL
for
the
travelling
salesman
problems
TSP
where
the
Q-learning
approach
is
used
to
select
suitable
metaheuristic
methods
in
different
iterations
at
run
time
from
two
different
type
metaheuristic
methods-artificial
bee
colony
ABC
and
genetic
algorithm
GA
</s>
<s>
The
algorithm
involves
two
phases
</s>
<s>
The
first
phase
explores
the
search
space
using
ABC
and
GA
independently
to
search
the
prominent
zones
of
the
optimal
paths
</s>
<s>
The
performances
of
GA
and
ABC
on
a
target
problem
are
noted
at
each
iteration
using
a
reward
table
RT
and
a
Q-table
QT
</s>
<s>
The
second
phase
uses
the
method
with
better
performance
in
each
iteration
to
modify
the
population
</s>
<s>
The
entries
of
RT
and
QT
are
updated
accordingly
</s>
<s>
In
this
way
ABC-GA-QL
enhances
the
quality
of
the
search
process
</s>
<s>
The
basic
perturbation
rule
of
ABC
is
modified
for
the
TSPs
using
swap
operation
and
the
exploitation
of
the
method
is
updated
using
3
Opt
operation
</s>
<s>
GA
is
also
modified
using
multi-point
cyclic
crossover
and
3
Opt
operation
to
deal
with
the
TSPs

<s>
ABC-GA-QL
is
tested
against
a
set
of
asymmetric

symmetric
TSPs
from
TSPLIB

significantly
large
sizes

The
method
finds
optimal

280
nodes

Its
performance
is
compared

approaches
