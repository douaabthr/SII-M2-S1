The

Optimization
SCSO
algorithm
is
characterized
by
slow
convergence
speed

To
address
these
issues
a
hybrid
multi-strategy
variant
known
as
HSCSO
is
proposed

The
algorithm
first
employs
an
Elite
Opposition-Based

strategy

generates
complementary
candidate
solutions
providing
a
more
diverse
set
of
initial
solutions

improving
the
distribution

Subsequently
a

strategy
is
utilized
to
combine
the
position

the
golden

algorithm
which
has
a
fixed
search
pattern
with
the
position

This

retains

Finally
a
