Metaheuristic
algorithms
implicitly

typically
aim
to
achieve
a
delicate
balance
between
exploration

exploitation
when
improving

a
given
optimization
problem

Diversity

are
crucial
indicators
for
both
exploration

as
a
valuable
tool

assessing
the

metaheuristic

Applying

computational

To

This
method
calculates
diversity
by
linearizing

counting
the

Compared

demonstrates
superior
