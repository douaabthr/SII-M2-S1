strategic

<s>
In
many
call
center
scenarios
if
the
server
is
busy
the
arriving
customer
moves
to
premium/ordinary
orbit
i.e.
becomes
a
repeated
customer
otherwise
if
the
server
is
accessible
the
arriving
customer
joins
the
system
to
receive
the
required
service
</s>
<s>
Once
the
service
is
completed
the
server
will
look
into
the
premium
orbit
to
check
whether
there
is
any
customer
who
needs
service
</s>
<s>
If
no
new
customer
from
premium/ordinary
orbit
or
outside
arrives
and
the
system
is
empty
then
the
server
takes
a
vacation

<s>
The
customer
s
decision
to
wait
or
balk
from
the
system
depends
on
the

s
status

receiving
