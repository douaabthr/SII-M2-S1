introducing

To
tackle

we
develop
an

algorithm

In

The
algorithm
adapts
to
real-time

in
the
dynamic
phase
by
transferring
pheromone

find
the
best
solutions
at

This

exploits

explores
high-quality

Our
proposed
algorithm
is
validated
through
extensive
experimental
scenarios

Results
show
that
our
method
produced
high-quality

to
existing
heuristics
and
nature-inspired
methods
particularly
in
complex
