AmI
is
defined
as
the
capability
of
environments
to
interact
intelligently
and
adaptively
through
sensors
and
devices
that
respond
effectively
to
the
presence
and
needs
of
users

Key
real-world
applications
include
Healthcare
remote
monitoring
of
chronic
patients
and
prediction
of
behavior
in
dementia
care
Home
automation
adaptive
lighting
and
temperature
systems
and
Security

Although
these
models
are
crucial
for
making
data-driven

they
require
significant
