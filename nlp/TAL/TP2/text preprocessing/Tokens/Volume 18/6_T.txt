The
job
shop
scheduling
problem
JSSP
is
a
well-known
NP-hard
combinatorial
optimization
problem
that
focuses
on
assigning
tasks
to
limited
resources
while
adhering
to
certain
constraints

Currently

solve
the
JSSP

Some
of
the
proposed
approaches
attempt
to
leverage
the
structural
information
of
the
JSSP
to
capture
the
dynamics

the
environment
without
considering
the
time
dependency
within
the
JSSP
</s>
<s>
However
learning
graph
representations
only
from
the
structural
relationship
of
nodes
results
in
a
weak
and
incomplete
representation
of
these
graphs
which
does
not
provide
an

representation

In
this
study
unlike
existing
frameworks
we
defined
the
JSSP

To
this
end
we
propose
a
novel

captures
both
the

construct
rich
