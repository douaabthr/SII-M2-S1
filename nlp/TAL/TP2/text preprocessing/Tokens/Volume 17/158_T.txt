Dynamics
of
rapid
evolution
on
the
basis
of
phenotypic
adaptation
and
ecological
opportunities
</s>
<s>
Recent
studies
have
demonstrated
that
evolution
can
be
observed
in
a
few
dozen
generations
especially
when
species
occupy
a
new
ecological
opportunity
due
to
environmental
changes
</s>
<s>
There
are
several
factors
that
induce
this
rapid
evolution
and
are
related
to
the
phenotype
and
its
response
to
the
environment
</s>
<s>
This
response
is
then
determined
by
phenotypic
variation
because
if
patterns
of
diversity
in
a
population
produce
a
rapid
response
to
an
environmental
change
then
rapid
adaptation
to
the
new
environment
can
occur

This
paper
aims
to
investigate
patterns
of
evolution
of
species
in
an
artificial
ecosystem
and
to
highlight
some
patterns
that
promote
rapid
evolution
</s>
<s>
Understanding
how
rapid
evolution
occurs
is
not
only
of
fundamental
importance
in
understanding
evolutionary
processes
and
species
conservation
but
also
to
provide
support
for
improving
the
resolution
of
certain
types
of
problems
especially
those
in
which
the
solution
is
time-variant
</s>
<s>
To
achieve
the
objectives
of
this
paper
a
computational
model
of
Adaptive
Radiation
was
designed
using
the
concepts
of
Biogeographic
Computing
an
area
of
knowledge
that
studies
ecosystems
as
information
processors
a
fundamental
principle
of
Natural
Computing
</s>
<s>
Habitats
are
represented
by
adaptive
surfaces
which
in
turn
are
composed
of
different
ecological
opportunities
</s>
<s>
The
results
show
for
example
that
dramatic
changes
in
ecosystems
can
lead
to
a
rapid
response
and
a
rapid
adaptation
to
new
ecological
opportunities
mainly
because
of
the
emergent
and
self-sustaining
behaviour
promoted
by
the
continuous
speciation
extinction
and
adaptation
of
species
</s>
<s>
This
emergent
dynamic
supports
the
thesis
that
rapid
environmental
changes
can
lead
to
rapid
evolution
</s>
<s>
This
behaviour
in
turn
is
highly
desired
when
considering
time-varying
problem
solving
</s>
<s>
If
solutions
to
a
problem
are
changing
over
time
sometimes
it
is
necessary
to
rapidly
find
new
solutions
