On
the
new
solution

interval

programming
problems
</s>
<s>
In
this
paper
we
study
the
interval
linear
fractional
programming
problems
using
the
concept
of
g
division
</s>
<s>
We
transform
the
problem
into
a
new
linear
fractional
programming
problem
and
obtain
a
nondominated
solution
to
the
interval
linear
fractional
programming
problem
</s>
<s>
We
show
that
the
new
solution
dominates
the
previous
nondominated
objective
value
presented
in
the
literature
</s>
<s>
Finally
some
examples
are
provided
to
illustrate
our
results
.
