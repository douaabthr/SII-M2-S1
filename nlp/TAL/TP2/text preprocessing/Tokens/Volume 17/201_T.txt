Deep

deep

make
incorrect

Testing
tasks
based

DNN
systems
often
require
annotation

obtain

However
collecting
and
annotating
large
amounts

is
very
expensive

time
consuming

Thus
we
propose
DeepSense
an
effective
neural

test
prioritization
technique
to
select
more
test
inputs
that
reveal
neural

To
be

we
first
designed
multiple

Then
the

extracted

construct
an

a

is
performed
to
calculate
the

then
spatial

are

Finally

used
to
combine
multiple

spatial

set

accordingly

We
evaluate
DeepSense
on
