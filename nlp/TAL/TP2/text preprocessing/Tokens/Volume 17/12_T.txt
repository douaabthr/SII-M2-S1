Based

study

However
most

Therefore
based

we
investigate
the
incomplete

fuzziness

the

the
fuzzy

the

To
measure
the
maximum

incomplete

the
importance
of
fuzziness
we
present
two
optimal
indices
which
are
the
expected
value
of
incomplete
information
and
the
value
of
fuzzy
solution
and
study
their
theoretical
properties
