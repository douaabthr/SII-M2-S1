Heritability
of
morphological

robots

<s>
In
the
field
of
evolutionary
robotics
choosing
the
correct
genetic
representation
is
a
complicated
and
delicate
matter
especially
when
robots
evolve
behaviour
and
morphology
at
the
same
time
</s>
<s>
One
principal
problem
is
the
lack
of
methods
or
tools
to
investigate
and
compare
representations
</s>
<s>
In
this
paper
we
introduce
and
evaluate
such
a
tool
based
on
the
biological
notion
of
heritability
</s>
<s>
Heritability
captures
the
proportion
of
phenotypic
variation
caused
by
genotypic
variation
and
is
often
used
to
better
understand
the
transmissibility
of
traits
in
real
biological
systems
</s>
<s>
As
a
proof
of
concept
we
compare
the
heritability
of
various
robot
traits
in
two
systems
one
using
a
direct
tree
based
representation
and
one
using
an
indirect
grammar
based
representation
</s>
<s>
We
measure
changes
in
heritability
during
the
course
of
evolution
and
investigate
how
direct
and
indirect
representation
can
be
biased
towards
more
exploration
or
exploitation
throughout
the
course
of
evolution
</s>
<s>
The
empirical
study
shows
that
heritability
can
be
a
useful
tool
to
analyze
different
representations
without
running
complete
evolutionary
processes
using
them
.
