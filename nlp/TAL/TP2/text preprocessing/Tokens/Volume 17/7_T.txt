This
paper
investigates
an
option
contract
for
emergency
material
reserve
because
of
quality
catastrophic
change
</s>
<s>
The
quality
catastrophic
change
happens
randomly
and
the
realized
number
can
not
be
observed
until
it
happened
</s>
<s>
Thus
it
is
necessary
to
reserve
some
emergency
material
beforehand
</s>
<s>
However
the
demander
is
not
qualified
to
make
the
storage
</s>
<s>
Meanwhile
the
supplier
has
no
motivation
to
make
storage
for
the
demander
</s>
<s>
Thus
an
option
contract
is
proposed
to
encourage
the
supplier
to
make
backup
for
the
demander
and
share
the
shortage
cost
if
the
backup
less
than
the
realized
option
order
quantity

Three
models
are
discussed
the
centralized
model
without
option
the
decentralized
model
without
option
and
the
decentralized
model
with
option
</s>
<s>
The
results
demonstrate
that
the
order
quantity
for
the
first
time
under
the
centralized
scenario
is
greater
than
that
under
the
decentralized
model
without
option
</s>
<s>
And
the
order
of
the
purchase
quantity
for
the
first
time
under
the
three
scenarios
depend
on
the
parameters
decided
by
the
both
players
</s>
<s>
Meanwhile
through
analysing
the
effective
range
of
option
fee
is
proved
to
be
limited

an
interval
