With
the
wide
application

Semantic
Web
and
the
rapid
development
of
the
Resource

Framework
RDF
the
demand
for
data
processing

inconsistent

imprecise
information
has
become
more
and
more
urgent
</s>
<s>
Recently
the
fuzzy
extension
of
RDF
data
has
received
widespread
attention
because

their
ability

represent
and
process

An
important
issue
for
the
success
of
fuzzy
RDF
applications
is
how
to
achieve
persistent
data
storage

query
capabilities

<s>
In
this
article
we
investigate
the
storage
and
query
of
fuzzy
RDF
data

To
accomplish
this
we
study
how
to
formally
map
fuzzy
RDF
graph
represented
by
the
labeled
directed
graph
structure
to
Property
Graphs
PGs
database
storage
model

Moreover
we
manage
these

by
a
chosen
Neo4j

Finally
we
have
compared
our
method
based
on
Neo4j
graph
database
with
the
method
based
on
relational
database

the
experimental
results
prove
that
using
the
graph

is
effective
and
