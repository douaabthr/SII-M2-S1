This
paper
proposes
a
novel
optimization
algorithm
called
Single
Candidate
Optimizer
SCO
that
relies
only
on
a
single
candidate
solution
throughout
the
whole
optimization
process
</s>
<s>
The
proposed
algorithm
implements
a
unique
set
of
equations
to
effectively
update
the
position
of
the
candidate
solution
</s>
<s>
To
balance
exploration
and
exploitation
SCO
is
integrated
with
the
two-phase
strategy
where
the
candidate
solution
updates
its
position
differently
in
each
phase
</s>
<s>
The
effectiveness
of
the
proposed
approach
is
validated
by
testing
it
on
thirty
three
classical
benchmarking
functions
and
four
real-world
engineering
problems

SCO
is
compared
with

with

According
to
Friedman
and
Wilcoxon

tests
SCO
can
significantly
outperform
all
other
algorithms
for
the

The
