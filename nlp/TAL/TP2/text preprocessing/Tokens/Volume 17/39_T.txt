Decision-making
and
coordination
of
green
supply
chain
with
corporate
social
responsibility
under
loss
aversion
</s>
<s>
This
paper
takes
a
two-level
green
supply
chain
composed
of
a
manufacturer
and
a
retailer
as
the
research
object
and
investigates
the
influence
of
loss
aversion
preference
and
corporate
social
responsibility
CSR
on
the
optimal
pricing
green
decision-making
and
performance
of
supply
chain
members
</s>
<s>
Firstly
the
basic
game
models
under
three
different
decision-making
situations
are
constructed
and
the
optimal
decision
of
the
above
models
is
obtained
</s>
<s>
Secondly
the
results
of
different
decision-making
models
are
compared
and
the
influence
of
corporate
social
responsibility
level
and
loss
aversion
preference
on
supply
chain
decision-making
and
performance
is
analyzed
</s>
<s>
Finally
in
order
to
improve
the
performance
of
supply
chain
a
combined
contract
of
revenue
sharing
and
responsibility
sharing
is
designed
to
coordinate
the
green
supply
chain
under
different
preferences
of
the
manufacturer
</s>
<s>
The
results
show
that
the
retailer
undertaking
CSR
is
conducive
to
the
green
development
of
the
supply
chain
but
the
loss
aversion
preference
of
the
manufacturer
will
have
a
negative
impact
on
the
supply
chain
members
</s>
<s>
In
addition
when
the
manufacturer
has
rational
preference
with
the
improvement
of
the
retailer
s
CSR
level
the
effective
coordination
interval
length
of
coordination
factors
under
combined
contracts
increases
and
the
coordination
flexibility
of
supply
chain
increases
</s>
<s>
When
the
manufacturer
loss
aversion
preference
the
upper
and
lower
limits
of
the
coordination
factor
of
the
combined
contract
will
increase
with
the
increase
of
loss
aversion
preference
and
the
length
of
the
coordination
interval
will
decrease
which
will
lead
to
the
difficulty
of
cooperation
among
supply
chain
members
.
