Solving

one

research
areas

In
this

a
novel
two-phase

TPHF
is
proposed
to
provide
elite

for
selection

many-objective

algorithms
MaOAs
to
improve
their
performance

<s>
The
proposed
TPHF
framework
generates
solutions
using
a
novel

PSO
operator
along
with
a
genetic
algorithm
operator
during
a
two-phase
calculated
search
based
on
the
average

of
the
PSO
particles

TPHF
focuses

The

replaced
by
a

uses
the

The
