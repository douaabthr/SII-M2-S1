As
the
objective
function
in
complex
structural
optimization
problems
is
implicit
in
the
present
improved
Newton
method
using
the
higher-order
approximation
a
new
and
simple
formulation
is
proposed
to
calculate
the
first

second-order
derivatives
of
the
objective
function

Furthermore
by
combining
the
presented
improved
Newton
method
with
an
innovative
metaheuristic

an

INMA
