The
work
is
carried
out
on
the
finding
that
low
recognition
accuracy
of
Meitei
Mayek
handwritten
characters
is
due
to
the
presence
of
highly
shape-similar
confusing
character
pairs

First
the

For
these
confusing
characters
pairs
the
zone
information

are
incorporated
in

The

carried
out

This

the
