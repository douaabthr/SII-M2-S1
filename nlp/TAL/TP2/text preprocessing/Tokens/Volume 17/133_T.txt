This
paper
proposes
a
novel
optimization
algorithm
called
center
of
gravity
CoG
</s>
<s>
The
main
idea
of
CoG
is
attributing
the
potential
function
to
a
set
of
particles
in
problem
space
and
finding
the
contour
lines
</s>
<s>
With
each
particle
moving
with
a
predefined
location
in
search
space
the
potential
function
is
defined
based
on
particle
s
fitness
values
</s>
<s>
The
particles
are
then
ranked
according
to
their
finesses
</s>
<s>
Through
clustering
of
particles
the
contour
line
will
be
constructed
which
then
leads
to
determining
their
center
of
gravity
</s>
<s>
This
process
will
iteratively
continue
by
updating
the
particles
in
each
iteration
and
ultimately
achieving
the
global
CoG
</s>
<s>
The
proposed
CoG
algorithm
is
shown
to
be
useful
for
different
types
of
uni-modal
to
multi-modal
benchmark
functions
</s>
<s>
Also
optimizing
some
important
engineering
problems
has
been
considered
</s>
<s>
The
performance
of
this
new
optimization
algorithm
has
been
compared
with
some
of
the
optimization
algorithms
</s>
<s>
Simulation
results
confirm
that
the
CoG
algorithm
provides
performance
improvement
compared
to
other
existing
methods
in
various
scenarios
.
