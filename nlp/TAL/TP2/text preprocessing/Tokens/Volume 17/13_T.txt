As
a
dominant
method
in
evidential
reasoning
Bayesian
network
has
been
proved
powerful
in
discrete
fields
</s>
<s>
Although
Bayesian
network
performs
reliable
in
continuous
variables
and
interval
estimations
it
relies
on
discretizing
continuous
variables
or
building
an
approximate
model
to
conduct
which
causes
information
loss
and
accuracy
reduction
</s>
<s>
In
order
to
bridge
this
gap
this
paper
introduces
two
inference
rules
combined
with
four
inference
rules
proposed
by
other
scholars
</s>
<s>
Then
we
propose
a
concept
of
uncertain
inference
network
that
consists
of
six
basic
structures
matching
inference
rules
to
represent
relationships
and
logic
connection
among
the
evidence
</s>
<s>
Evidence
is
represented
by
uncertain
sets
that
can
apply
to
continuous

using
membership
functions

Furthermore
a
numeric
experiment
for
a
forensic
investigation
of
fire
incidents
is
given
to
compare
the
results
of
uncertain

network

Bayesian
network
</s>
<s>
We
found
three
merits
in
the
case
study
</s>
<s>
First
an
uncertain
inference
network
has
simpler
data
access
for
each
node
because
Bayesian
network
depends
on
conditional
probability
tables
while
uncertain
inference
network
only
relies
on
membership
function
</s>
<s>
Second
an
uncertain
inference
network
has
a
more
wide
application
because
it
can
perform
continuous
variables
with
certain
mathematical
formulas
without
discretizing
or
approximating
</s>
<s>
Third
an
uncertain
inference
network
has
a
more
accurate
result
because
Bayesian
network
gives
a
point
estimation
with
a
0
1
value
while
uncertain
inference
network
conducts
an
interval
estimation
with
a
range
value
.
