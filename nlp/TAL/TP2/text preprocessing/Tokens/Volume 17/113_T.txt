An
improved
grasshopper
optimization
algorithm
GOA
is
proposed
in
this
paper
termed
CMRWGOA
which
combines
both
Random
Weight
shorted
RWGOA
and
Cauchy
mutation
termed
CMGOA
mechanism
into
the
GOA

The
GOA
received
inspiration
from
the
foraging
and
swarming
habits
of
grasshoppers

<s>
The
performance
of
the
CMRWGOA
was
validated
by
23
benchmark
functions
in
comparison
with
four
well-known
meta-heuristic
algorithms
AHA

The

conducted
on

Furthermore
the
CMRWGOA

Various
