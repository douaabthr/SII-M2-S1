Special
issue
on
Towards
robust
explainable
and
interpretable
artificial
intelligence
</s>
<s>
The
complexity
of
modern
artificial
intelligence
AI
models
has
raised
the
question
about
their
interpretability
</s>
<s>
The
terms
interpretability
and
explainability
have
been
used
interchangeably
by
researchers
</s>
<s>
These
two
terms
sound
very
closely
related
although
they
have
to
be
meant
differently
</s>
<s>
Interpretability
is
mostly
related
to
the
outcome
of
the
cause-and-effect
relationship
given
the
inputs
of
a
system
</s>
<s>
Explainability
deals
with
the
internal
logic
of
a
machine
learning
system
</s>
<s>
It
aims
to
characterize
model
accuracy
and
transparency
in
AI-powered
decision
making
</s>
<s>
It
is
clear
that
there
is
a
need
for
a
proper
mathematical
formalism
that
is
still
missing
</s>
<s>
Hence
there
is
a
trade-off
between
the
performance
of
a
machine
learning
model
and
its
ability
to
produce
explainable
and
interpretable
predictions
</s>
<s>
The
study
of
robust
systems
which
are
also
explainable
and
interpretable
is
still
under
way
.
