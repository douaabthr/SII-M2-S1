<s>
In
this
paper
we
study
option
contracts
for
emergency
material
reserves
due
to
unexpected
events
</s>
<s>
Contingencies
occur
randomly
and
the
amount
of
realization
cannot
be
known
until
it
breaks
out
</s>
<s>
Therefore
it
is
important
to
stockpile
some
necessary
supplies
in
advance
</s>
<s>
However
a
large
advance
stockpile
on
the
demand
side
would
incur
low-carbon
disposal
costs
which
are
not
economical
</s>
<s>
Also
the
supplier
will
have
no
incentive
to
stockpile
for
the
demander
due
to
low
carbon
disposal
costs
and
production
costs
</s>
<s>
Therefore
we
propose
a
contractual
approach
with
option
to
stimulate
supplier
to
stockpile
for
his
client
</s>
<s>
Three
models
are
discussed
based
on
the
consideration
of
low-carbon
disposal
costs
a
centralized
decision
case
a
non-option
decentralized
case
and
a
decentralized
case
with
option
</s>
<s>
The
outcomes
demonstrate
that
the
number
of
first
orders
under
the
decentralized
case
without
option
is
less
than
the
order
quantity
under
the
centralized
case
</s>
<s>
Moreover
the
size
of
the
first
purchase
volume
in
all
three
cases
depends
on
the
both
parties
practical
factors
</s>
<s>
Meanwhile
the
reasonable
interval
of
option
fee
is
obtained
by
analysis
.
