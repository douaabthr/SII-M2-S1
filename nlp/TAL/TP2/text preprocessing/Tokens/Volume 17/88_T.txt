Blockchain
refers
to
a
collection
of
digitally
connected
applications
originated
to
enable
secure
financial
transactions
but
soon
has
evolved
as
a
reliable
tool
for
secure
data
management
as
well
as
the
foundation
for
smart
and
sustainable
manufacturing

This

tracks
the
evolution
of
blockchain
technology
for
smart
manufacturing
using
data
mining
approaches

the

field

<s>
We
show
that
blockchain
technology
in
manufacturing
is
still
in
its
infancy
and
is
expected
to
lay
foundations
for
the
development
of
the
next

of
industrial
revolution
</s>
<s>
We
track
the
inter
and
intra-disciplinarity
of
the
technology
and
knowledge
diffusion
between
its
various
domains
by
clustering
the
technology
into
fifty-five
subdomains

The
developments
in
each
of
these
subdomains
are
discussed
in

tracking

further
develop

Based

a

The
