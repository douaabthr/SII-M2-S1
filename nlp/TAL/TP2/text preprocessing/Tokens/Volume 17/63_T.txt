The

</s>
<s>
However
processing

</s>

In
this
perspective
we
propose
a
hybrid
classifier
that
combines
radial
basis
function
RBF
and
extreme
learning
machine
ELM
neural
networks
</s>
<s>
This
combination
is
motivated
by
the
high
performances
and
the
complementary
of
these
two
types
of
neural
networks
</s>
<s>
The
basic
idea
relies
on
complementing
a
compact
RBF
network
by
an
ELM
network
that
contains
a
diversity
of
hidden
neurons
</s>

The
optimization
of
the
number

performed
using
a
genetic
algorithm
GA
</s>
<s>
The
objectives
of
the
proposed
classifier
can
be
summarized
as
follows
</s>
<s>
First
it
benefits
from
the
complementary
properties
of
RBF
and
ELM
like
local
response
of
RBFs
and
global
response
of
ELM
</s>
<s>
Second
it
makes
use
of
the
advantages
of
ELM
like
fast
training
and
the
possibility
of
using
a
variety
of
activation
functions
</s>
<s>
Third
it
alleviates
the
ill
conditioning
problem
of
ELM
by
joining
the
systematic
initialization
of
RBF
to
the
random
initialization
of
ELM
</s>
<s>
Fourth
the
optimization
process
performed
using
GA
is
simplified
because
it
concerns
only
the
added
neurons
which
their
role
is
complementing
the
RBF
network
