During

traditional

methods
only
consider

To
address
this

this

proposes
a
complex

link
prediction
method
based

resource
broadcast

Firstly
the

provides
a
detailed
analysis
of
the

structure
between
the
source
node
and
the
target
node
presenting
four
different

Secondly
in
order
to
characterize
the
initial
resources
the
paper
defines
the
effective
resource
amount
after
transmission
through
these
four
paths
as
the
resource
broadcast
amount
between
nodes
</s>
<s>
Lastly
the
similarity
between
nodes
is
characterized
bidirectionally
by
considering
the
resource

amount
between

Experiments
conducted
on
9
real

datasets
demonstrate
that
when
compared
with
8
other
similarity-based
indicators
this
method
achieves
better
prediction
results
according
to
benchmark
