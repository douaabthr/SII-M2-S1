Italy
offers
a
cultural
heritage
of
considerable
value
that
needs
to
be
protected

Indeed
natural
deterioration
linked
to
the
passage

time
affects
ancient
artifacts
and
buildings

<s>
Sometimes
the
deterioration
compromises
the
functionality
of
cultural
assets
pushing
them
toward
decay

<s>
In
this
scenario
effective
intervention
seems
impossible
on
the
various
critical
points
because
of
the
wide
variability
of
factors
involved
and
the
wide
range
of
possible
treatments

However
the
spread
of
low-cost
technologies
has
led
to
the
possibility
of
having
different
devices

able

communicate
and
interact
with
each
other

In

the

For

The
experimental
phase
consists
of
two

the
first
aims

evaluate
the

exploits
