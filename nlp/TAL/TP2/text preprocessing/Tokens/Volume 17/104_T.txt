Extreme

ELM

Compared
with
traditional
neural
network
algorithms
ELM
has
the
advantages
of
fast
training
speed
and
good
generalization
ability
with
guaranteed

accuracy
which
has
been
widely
used
in
practical
problems

However
due
to
the
randomness

the

ELM
requires
more

more

For
this

we
propose
an

AMFCSSA
called
AMFCSSA-ELM

In

Firstly
unimodal

Secondly
various

taken
to
