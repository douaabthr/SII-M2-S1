A
genetic
algorithm
GA
is
an
evolutionary
algorithm
inspired
by
the
natural
selection
and
biological
processes
of
reproduction
of
the
fittest
individual
</s>
<s>
GA
is
one
of
the
most
popular
optimization
algorithms
that
is
currently
employed
in
a
wide
range
of
real
applications
</s>
<s>
Initially
the
GA
fills
the
population
with
random
candidate
solutions
and
develops
the
optimal
solution

one
generation

next

The
GA
applies
