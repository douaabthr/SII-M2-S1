</s>
<s>
In
recent
years
detecting
fraud
transactions
has
become
a
popular
research
topic
because
credit
card
fraud
transactions
result
in
the
loss
of
billions
of
dollars
every
year
</s>
<s>
Therefore
the
need
for
financial
institutions
and
banks
to
improve
their
fraud
detection
systems
is
increasing

<s>
Financial
institutions
are
increasingly
using
data
mining
to
develop
fraud
detection
systems
that
can
detect
and
stop
fraudulent
transactions
automatically

From
the
standpoint
of
machine
learning
detecting
fraud
transactions
is
a
binary
classification
problem

<s>
However
interpretability
is
essential
for
management
to
have
faith
in
the
used
model
and
to
develop
fraud
prevention
strategies
</s>
<s>
Designing
an
algorithm
that
can
detect
fraud
transactions
is
difficult
and
needs
a
higher
understanding
of
each
part
of
the
process
and
a
lot
of
time

However
hyperparameters
optimization
using
metaheuristics

Hyperparameters
optimization
is
a
technique

Using
