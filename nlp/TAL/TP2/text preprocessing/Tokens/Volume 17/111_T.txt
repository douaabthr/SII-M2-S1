<s>
Parkinson
s
disease
has
no
specific
test
for
diagnosis
which
is
usually
detected
through
a
review
of
signs
and
symptoms
like
tremors
stiffness
and
slowness
of
movement

Over
the
past
10
15
years
various
methods
were
proposed
that
use
motor
signs
and
voice
data
for
the
accurate
detection
of
Parkinson
s
disease
PD

Cutting-edge
technologies
like
machine
learning
deep
learning
image

were
employed
in

In
the
ongoing
research
over
the
past
few
years
various
datasets
were
generated
to
assess
PD

the
salient
parameters
of
the
voice
signals
acquired
from
healthy
people

PD
patients

Also
tremor
and
gait
data
were
collected
by
recording
the
movements
of
PD
patients
from
sensing
units
such
as
accelerometers
gyroscopes
and
inertial
measurement
unit
sensors
