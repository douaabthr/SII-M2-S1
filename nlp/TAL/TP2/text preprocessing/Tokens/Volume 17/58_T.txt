detection
</s>
<s>
Standard
method
of
assessing
breast
cancer
is
a
triple
test
assessment
</s>
<s>
In
this
method
initially
a
thorough
medical
examination
and
patient
history
is
evaluated
secondly
imaging
of
the
breast
using
x-rays
and/or
ultrasound
is
done
and
finally
a
preoperative
cytodiagnosis
is
done
that
is
either
Fine
Needle
Aspiration
Cytology
FNAC
or
Core
Needle
Biopsy
CNB
or
both
</s>
<s>
FNAC
being
a
minimally
invasive
and
rapidly
performed
test
is
preferred
in
many
cases
over
CNB
that
is
more
invasive
</s>
<s>
If
a
triple
test
gives
positive
result
in
any
one
of
the
three
steps
then
the
result
is
taken
positive
</s>
<s>
FNAC
involves
determining
the
cell
size
and
shape
parameters
and
based
on
their
values
a
case
is
classified
as
benign
or
malignant
