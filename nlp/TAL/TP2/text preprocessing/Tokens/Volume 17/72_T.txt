Many
measures
have
been
proposed
for
comparing
two
metric
spaces
but
they
do
not
consider
the
data
dispersion
in
each
metric
space
</s>
<s>
Furthermore
no
dedicated
measure
has
yet
been
proposed
for
comparing
two
metric
spaces
containing
elements
belonging
to
various
subtypes
of
a
global
datatype
</s>
<s>
In
order
to
attenuate
the
aforementioned
limitations
this
paper
proposes
a
new
technique
for
comparing
two
metric
spaces
</s>
<s>
More
formally
given
a
metric
spaceX
histograms
are
used
for
performing
a
gradual
analysis
of
the
data
dispersion
inside
the
neighborhood
of
each
element
ofX
</s>
<s>
This
is
a
refinement
of
the
neighborhoods
analysis
realized
in
an
existing
work
</s>
<s>
Then
another
existing
technique
is
used
for
associating
one
hidden
Markov
model
lambda
_X
withXsuch
that
lambda
_X
learns
the
bin
values
and
the
visual
shapes
of
the
histograms
derived
from
the
instances
inX
</s>
<s>
Meta-data
derived
from
lambda
_X
are
then
saved
as
the
components
of
a
descriptor
vector
overrightarrow
X
associated
withX
</s>
<s>
Finally
the
comparison
between
two
metric
spaces
is
performed
through
the
comparison
of
their
respective
associated
descriptor
vectors
using
existing
distance
or
similarity
measures
between
two
vectors
</s>
<s>
The
proposed
approach
inherits
the
accuracy
and
the
efficiency
of
the
existing
techniques
on
which
it
relies
</s>
<s>
Therefore
the
experiments
realized
in
this
paper
are
only
intended
to
show
how
it
can
be
used
for
comparing
particular
metric
spaces
containing
geolocations
or
stars
in
the
celestial
sphere
.
