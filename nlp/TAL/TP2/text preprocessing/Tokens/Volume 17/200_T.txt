This
paper
addresses
the
well-known
NP-hard
problem
the
Symmetric
Travelling
Salesman
Problem
STSP
which
has
numerous
applications
in
logistics
and
graph
theory
</s>
<s>
To
solve
this
complex
problem
a
discrete
version
of
the
Marine
Predators
Algorithm
D-MPA
is
introduced
</s>
<s>
Although
MPA
has
been
extensively
studied
for
various
optimization
problems
and
real-world
applications
its
use
in
routing
problems
particularly
TSP
remains
relatively
unexplored
</s>
<s>
To
adapt
MPA
for
STSP
the
positions
of
individuals
are
initially
updated
using
the
classical
MPA
algorithm
</s>
<s>
The
continuous
values
generated
by
the
classical
MPA
are
then
converted
to
discrete
values
followed
by
the
application
of
a
permutation
operator
to
maintain
diversity
in
the
population
</s>
<s>
In
addition
a
local
search
algorithm
2
opt
is
applied
to
further
improve
the
results
for
STSP
instances
</s>
<s>
The
effectiveness
of
the
proposed
algorithm
is
demonstrated
on
STSP
benchmark
instances
of
sizes
ranging
from
14
to
439

The

To
ensure
an
unbiased
and
rigorous
comparison
descriptive
statistics
such
as
mean
and
standard
deviation
are
used
and
a
Wilcoxon
Signed-Rank
test
is
conducted
for
statistical
validation
</s>
<s>
The
results
demonstrate
that
D-MPA
not
only
competes
but
also
consistently
outperforms
these
algorithms
making
it
a
valuable

for
the
