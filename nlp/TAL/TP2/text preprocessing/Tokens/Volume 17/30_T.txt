Based

Firstly
on
the
basis
of
the
research
of
optimality
conditions
for
polynomial
optimization
problems
the
paper
considers
nonlinear
programming
over
constrains
which
are
not
real
polynomial
functions

And
then
necessary
global
optimality
conditions
for
nonlinear
programming
problems
with
non-polynomial
constraints
functions
are
proposed
and
sufficient
global
optimality
conditions
for
polynomial
objective
function
programming
problems
with
non-polynomial
constraints
functions
are
developed
by
using
the
alternative
theorem

Finally
necessary
and
sufficient

for

1
quadratic
programming
problems
are
presented
