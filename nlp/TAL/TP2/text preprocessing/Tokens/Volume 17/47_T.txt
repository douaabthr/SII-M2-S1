Firstly
the
Kent

is
used
to
initialize
the
location
of
individual
butterfly
and
increase
the
diversity
of
initial
population

Secondly
adaptive
switch
probability
is
introduced
in
search
phases
to
balance
local
search
and
global
search
phase

Then
the
adaptive
weight
coefficient
is
introduced
to
adjust
the
search
direction
and
the
moving
step
of
the
individual
butterfly
to
improve
the
convergence
speed
and
accuracy
of
the
algorithm

Finally
Cauchy
variation
is
carried
out
to
guide
the
advance

of
the
population

avoid
falling
