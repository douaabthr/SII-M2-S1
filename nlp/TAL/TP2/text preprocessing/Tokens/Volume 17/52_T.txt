To

performance
of

optimization
PSO

balance
convergence
and
diversity
we
propose
a
coevolutionary

particle

CMOPSO

CMOPSO
includes
3
strategies
coevolutionary
mechanism
best-effort
strategy

weighted

approach

<s>
Coevolutionary
mechanism
is
used
to
maintain
convergence
while
PSO
operator
focuses
on
diversity
</s>
<s>
Best-effort
strategy
allows
operators
that
perform
well
enough
to
execute
again
which
improves
the
utilization
of
computing
resources
</s>
<s>
Weighted
maximum
approach
is
an
environmental
selection
strategy
based
on
decomposition
which
selects
by
comparing
the
maximum
of
weighted
objective
values
of
the
subproblem
