Prolonging
network

has
long
been
one
of
the
most
critical
challenges
in
designing
wireless
sensor
networks
in

mobile
wireless
sensor
networks
in
particular
</s>
<s>
Regarding
network
lifetime
one
of
the
factors
affecting
it
the
most
is
energy
efficiency

In
a
mobile
wireless
sensor
network
compared
to
stationary
ones
energy
management
has
an
even
greater
impact
on
the
network
lifetime
since
the
movement
of
the
sensors
drains
an
enormous
amount
of
energy

Moreover
in
target-based
wireless

it
is
mandatory

In

paper
we
investigate

We

the
