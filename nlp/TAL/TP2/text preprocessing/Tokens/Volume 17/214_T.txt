Self-awareness
in
natural

systems
a

approach

Self-awareness
is
a
subject
that
has
intrigued
the
research
community
for
a
long
time
and
is
an
object
of
extensive
experimental
research
</s>
<s>
Over
the
years
multiple
studies
and
experiments
probed
different
aspects
functions
and
manifestations
of
self-awareness
in
animals
and
humans
</s>
<s>
From
these
results
several
intriguing
questions
arose
is
self-awareness
a
general
phenomenon
based
on
some
common
laws
and
principles
of
organization
and
processing
information
about
sensory
environments
</s>
<s>
Are
different
manifestations
of
self-awareness
demonstrated
in
multiple
experiments
interrelated
on
some
common
basis
or
unrelated
and
disparate
</s>
<s>
In
this
work
we
set
out
to
approach
these
questions
on
the
basis
of
the
perspective
of
organization
and
processing
of
the
information
about
the
sensory
environment
of
an
intelligent
system
external
and
internal
</s>
<s>
We
conjecture
that
a
possible
basis
for
understanding
the
development
and
evolution
of
self-awareness
can
be
the
theory
of
complex
coordinated
intelligent
responses
that
require
a
coordination
of
multiple
atomic
intelligent
actions
to
achieve
the
best
possible
outcome
for
the
intelligent
system
</s>
<s>
In
this
approach
self-awareness
can
emerge
naturally
as
an
information
model
of
the
sensory
environments
that
facilitates
the
production
of
effective
responses
via
selection
by
the
fitness
to
the
environment
measured
by
the
success
of
empirical
trials
</s>
<s>
We
consider
different
types
and
levels
of
self-awareness
examined
in
studies
and
experiments
and
discuss
how
they
can
be
connected
with
the
organization
and
functions
of
the
information
model
of
the
environment
involved
in
the
formation
of
intelligent
responses
</s>
<s>
The
information
approach
to
self-awareness
is
used
then
to
discuss
possible
directions
of
evolution
of
the
information
models
in
the
natural
and
artificial
intelligent
systems
