The

is
to
introduce
a
new
rich
source
of
ideas
and
techniques
that
could
be
used
to
build
new
algorithms
capable
to
solve
numerous
encountered

The
art
of
war
is
one
of
the
most
rich
disciplines
in
terms
of
already
experimented
strategies
and
tactics
that
can
inspire
researchers
to
design
new
powerful
and
efficient
metaheuristics

The
framework
of
the
