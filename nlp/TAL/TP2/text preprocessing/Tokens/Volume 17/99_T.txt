The
teaching
learning-based
optimization
algorithm
TLBO
is
an
efficient
optimizer
</s>

However
it
has
several
shortcomings
such
as
premature
convergence
and
stagnation
at
local
optima
</s>
<s>
In
this
paper
the
strengthened
teaching
learning-based
optimization
algorithm
STLBO
is
proposed
to
enhance
the
basic
TLBO
s
exploration
and
exploitation
properties
by
introducing
three
strengthening
mechanisms
the
linear
increasing
teaching
factor
the
elite
system
composed
of
new
teacher
and
class
leader
and
the
Cauchy
mutation
</s>
<s>
Subsequently
seven
variants
of
STLBO
are
designed
based
on
the
combined
deployment
of
the
three
improved
mechanisms
</s>
<s>
Performance
of
the
novel
STLBOs
is
evaluated
by
implementing
them
on
thirteen
numerical
optimization
tasks
including
the
seven
unimodal
tasks
f1
f7
and
six
multimodal
tasks
f8
f13
</s>
<s>
The
results
show
that
STLBO7
is
at
the
top
of
the
list
significantly
better
than
the
original
TLBO
</s>
<s>
Moreover
the
remaining
six
variants
of
STLBO
also
outperform
TLBO
</s>
<s>
Finally
a
set
of
comparisons
are
implemented
between
STLBO7
and
other
advanced
optimization
techniques
such
as
HS
PSO
MFO
GA
and
HHO
</s>
<s>
The
numerical
results
and
convergence
curves
prove
that
STLBO7
clearly
outperforms
other
competitors
has
stronger
local
optimal
avoidance
faster
convergence
speed
and
higher

accuracy

All
