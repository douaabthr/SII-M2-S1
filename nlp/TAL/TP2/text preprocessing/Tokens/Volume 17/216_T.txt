In
many
industrial
real-world
environments
scheduling
necessitates
continual
reactive
adjustments
due
to
unpredictable
perturbations
leading
to
the
dynamic
transformation
of
predefined
static
schedules

In
this
paper
we
introduce
a
new
framework
named
a
two-level
evolutionary
algorithm
2LEA
as
a
comprehensive
approach
for
addressing
the
dynamic
flexible
job
shop
scheduling
problem
</s>
<s>
The
2LEA
is
based
on
a
bi-level
optimization
design
where
the
upper
level
is
dedicated
to
solving
the
general
flexible
job
shop
scheduling
problem
and
the
lower
level
is
used
as
a
new
evolutionary
operator
guided
by
a
probability
rate
in
the
upper
level
focusing
on
the
optimization
of
operation
sequences

handling

By
addressing
the

this

fills
