</s>
<s>
In
this
work
we
introduce
a
template-based
computational
method
to
recognize
chords
through
an
audio
recording
of
a
musical
instrument
</s>
<s>
The
algorithm
is
based
on
a
temporal
frequency
analysis
using
Gabor
s
filter
banks
</s>
<s>
These
filters
are
centered
over
adjusted
frequencies
of
musical
notes
in
different
octaves
and
the
adjustment
is
accomplished
in
terms
of
the
detunings
on
the
recording
</s>
<s>
Using
the
results
in
the
filtering
stage
a
geometric
mean
of
each
chord
is
calculated
</s>
<s>
It
is
important
to
mention
that
these
statistics
are
calculated
from
the
combination
of
notes
that
form
each
chord
and
are
automatically
grouped
as
templates
</s>
<s>
The
presence
of
chords
is
determined
from
these
metrics
</s>
<s>
Several
experiments
are
carried
out
for
major
minor
augmented
diminished
and
suspended
chords
played
on
acoustic
guitar
classic
guitar
electric
guitar
piano
and
ukulele

<s>
A
comparative
study
against
machine-learning
classifiers
is
presented
</s>
<s>
The
results
show
a
superior
performance
of
the
present
approach
</s>
<s>
In
addition
the
proposed
method
presents
the
advantage
that
it
does
not
require
a
training
stage
in
contrast
with
the
methods
based
on
machine-learning
algorithms
