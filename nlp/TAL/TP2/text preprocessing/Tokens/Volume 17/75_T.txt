Many-objective

Recently
the
efficient
deployment
of
wireless
sensor
networks
WSNs
has
become
a
leading
field
of
research
in
WSN
design
optimization
</s>
<s>
Practical
scenarios
related
to
WSN
deployment
are
often
considered
as
optimization
models
with
multiple
conflicting
objectives
that
are
simultaneously
enhanced
</s>
<s>
In
the
related
literature
it
had
been
shown
that
moving
from
mono-objective
to
multi-objective
resolution
of
WSN
deployment
is
beneficial
</s>
<s>
However
since
the
deployment
of
real-world
WSNs
encompasses
more
than
three
objectives
a
multi-objective
optimization
may
harm
other
deployment
criteria
that
are
conflicting
with
the
already
considered
ones
</s>
<s>
Thus
our
aim
is
to
go
further
explore
the
modeling
and
the
resolution
of
WSN
deployment
in
a
many-objective
i.e.
optimization
with
more
than
three
objectives
fashion
and
especially
exhibit
its
added
value
</s>
<s>
In
this
context
we
first
propose
a
many-objective
deployment
model
involving
seven
conflicting
objectives
and
then
we
solve
it
using
an
adaptation
of
the
Decomposition-based
Evolutionary
Algorithm
theta
DEA

The
developed
adaptation
is
named
WSN
theta
DEA
and
is
validated
through
a
detailed
experimental
study
