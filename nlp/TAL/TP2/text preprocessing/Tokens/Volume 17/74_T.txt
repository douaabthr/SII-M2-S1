The

case
was
reported
in
Wuhan
China
and
spread
across
the
globe
with
an
unprecedented
impact
on
humanity
</s>

Since
this
pandemic
requires
pervasive
diagnosis
developing
smart
fast
and
efficient
detection
techniques
is
significant

To
this
end
we
have
developed
an
Artificial

classify
the

the
COVID-19
confirmed

In

the
developed
model
consists
of

we
calculate

opacities

the
CT
