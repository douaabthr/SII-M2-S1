The
Comprehensive

Algorithm
CLGSA
has
demonstrated
its
effectiveness

In
this
research
we
extended
the
CLGSA
to
tackle
NP-hard
combinatorial
problems
and
introduced
the
Discrete
Comprehensive

Algorithm
D-CLGSA

The
D-CLGSA
framework
incorporated
a

To
evaluate
the
algorithm

efficiency
we
conducted
two

Firstly
we
assessed
its
performance

The

identify
the

We
evaluated
