Solving
constrained
multi-objective
optimization
problems
is
a
challenging
task
and
existing
algorithms
have
been
struggling
to
balance
constrained
convergence
and
population
diversity
</s>
<s>
To
address
this
problem
this
paper
proposes
a
dual-population
cooperative
algorithm
DPDCA
which
maintains
two
populations
and
an
archive
and
can
change
the
search
strategy
depending
on
the
evolutionary
stage
</s>
<s>
At
the
early
stage
of
evolution
the
two
populations
are
responsible
for
different
tasks
promote
rapid
convergence
of
the
populations
by
exchanging
solutions
and
save
promising
solutions
in
the
archive
</s>
<s>
In
the
later
stages
of
evolution
different
local
search
strategies
are
emphasized
according
to
the
diversity
of
the
main
populations
and
their
convergence
to
obtain
a
feasible
solution
set
with
better
convergence
</s>
<s>
In
order
to
prevent
the
algorithm
from
falling
into
local
optimality
at
a
later
stage
we
introduce
the
archive
to
enhance
the
diversity
of
the
populations
and
finally
the
main
populations
are
explored
in
depth
to
obtain
the
set
of
solutions
located
in
the
PF
</s>
<s>
To
test
the
superiority
of
the
algorithm
we
tested
it
against
five
state-of-the-art
algorithms
on
28
benchmark
test
problems
and
3
real-world
problems
proving
that
the
altered
algorithm
has
good
competitiveness
in
dealing
with
constrained

problems
