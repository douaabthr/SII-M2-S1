Typically
EC
methods
are
named
based
on
the
natural
processes
inspiring
them
such
as
swarm
intelligence
e.g.
ant
colony
optimization
artificial
bee
colony
and
particle
swarm
optimization
evolutionary
algorithms
e.g.
genetic
algorithms
genetic
programming
grammatical
evolution
and
differential
evolution
artificial
immune
systems
and
evolutionary
games
analyzing
strategic
interactions
among
different
population
types
