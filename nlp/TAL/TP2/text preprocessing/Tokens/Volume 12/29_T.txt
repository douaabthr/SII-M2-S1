With
the
rapid
development
of
smart
grid
to
solve
the
power
enterprises
requirement
in
short-term
load
forecasting
this
paper
proposes
a
short-term
electrical
load
forecasting
method
based
on
stacked
auto-encoding
and
GRU
Gated
recurrent
unit
neural
network
</s>
<s>
Firstly
the
method
input
historical
data
which
contains
power
load
weather
information
and
holiday
information
and
use
auto-encoding
to
compress
the
historical
data
and
then
the
multi-layer
GRU
is
used
to
construct
the
model
to
predict
the
power
load
</s>
<s>
The
experiment
results
show
compared
with
traditional
models
the
proposed
method
can
effectively
predict
the
daily
variation
of
power
load
and
have
lower
prediction
error
and
higher
precision
.
