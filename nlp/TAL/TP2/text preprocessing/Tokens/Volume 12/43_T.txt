The
human
face
is
one
of
the
most
important
organs
that
has
many
physiological
characteristics
such
as
the

gender
race
age
and
mood

Determining
the
gender
of
the
face
can
reduce
the
processing
time
of
large-scale
face-based
systems
and
may
improve
the
performance

Many
studies
were
proposed
for
gender
recognition

several
were
evaluated
using
the

as
a
