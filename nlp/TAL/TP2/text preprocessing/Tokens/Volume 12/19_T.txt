<s>
The
multiobjective
multidimensional
knapsack
problem
MOMKP
is
an
extension
of
the
multiobjective
knapsack
problem
that
consists
in
selecting
a
subset
of
items
in
order
to
maximizemobjective
functions
</s>
<s>
The
MOMKP
creates
an
additional
difficulty
than
the
monodimensional
version
caused
by
the
fact
of
respecting
more
than
one
constraint
simultaneously
</s>
<s>
In
this
paper
we
propose
to
solve
the
MOMKP
with
an
ant
colony
optimization
approach
based
on
a
gradual
weight
generation
method
named
Gw-ACO
</s>
<s>
Here
the
weight
vectors
are
gradually
distributed
in
the
objective
space
and
change
relatively
to
the
optimization
process
</s>
<s>
This
enables
ants
to
target
at
each
cycle
different
regions
in
order
to
try
to
achieve
almost
all
solutions
covering
the
Pareto
front
</s>
<s>
To
evaluate
the
suggested
Gw-ACO
approach
a
set
of
experiments
is
performed
on
MOMKP
benchmark
instances
and
compared
with
well-known
state-of-the-art
metaheuristic
approaches
</s>
<s>
The
obtained
experimental
results
show
that
Gw-ACO
is
significantly
better
and
able
to
achieve
a
well
distribution
all
over
the
Pareto-optimal
front
.
