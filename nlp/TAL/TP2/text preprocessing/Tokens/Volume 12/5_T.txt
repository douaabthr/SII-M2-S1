This
paper
presents
a
new
optimization
methodology
called
movable
damped
wave
algorithm
for
solving
global
optimization
problems
</s>
<s>
The
proposed
methodology
mimics
mathematically
the
behavior
of
waveform
induced
by
oscillating
phenomena
</s>
<s>
It
starts
by
creating
multiple
initial
random
solutions
which
are
updated
through
introducing
a
mathematical
model
based
on
a
damped
wave
function
</s>
<s>
In
the
proposed
methodology
the
updating
mechanisms
of
solutions
are
based
on
designing
a
mathematical
relation
for
the
movable
wave
with
the
aim
to
effectively
achieve
robust
solutions
</s>
<s>
Therefore
this
methodology
can
be
more
robust
statistically
sound
and
convergent
quickly
to
the
optimal
global
solution
</s>
<s>
The
performance
of
the
proposed
is
validated
by
carrying
out
on
23
benchmark
problems
and
three
engineering
design
problems
</s>
<s>
The
results
show
vividly
that
the
proposed
is
a
reliable
algorithm
and
outperforms
the
comparative
algorithms
in
most
cases
.
