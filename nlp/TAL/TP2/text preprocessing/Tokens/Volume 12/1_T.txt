Firefly

FA

The
standard
FA

three

firefly

termination
stage

A
major
drawback
associated
with
standard
FA
in
its
termination
stage
is
its
failure
in
getting
the
most
optimal

to
the
fact
that
after
a
fixed
number
of
iterations
no
significant
improvement
can
be
observed
in
the
solution
quality

this

resolved
