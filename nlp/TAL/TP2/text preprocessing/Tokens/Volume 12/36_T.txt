Sine
cosine
algorithm
SCA
is
a
recently
developed
optimization
technique
which
uses
sine
function
and
cosine
function
as
operators
to
find
the
global
optimal
solution

However
proper
parameter
setting
is
a
challenging
task

Only
using
the
number
of
iterations
to
adjust
the
algorithm
parameters
cannot
fully
reflect
the
convergence
information
in
the
evolution
process
so
SCA
lacks
the
adaptability
in
solving
different
optimization
problems

To

In
CSCA
the

The
