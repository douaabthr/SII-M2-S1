A
critical
discussion
into
the
core
of
swarm
intelligence
algorithms
</s>
<s>
The
literature
is
now
filled
with
swarm
intelligence
algorithms
developed
by
taking
inspiration
from
a
number
of
insects
and
other
animals
and
phenomena
such
as
ants
termites
bees
fishes
and
cockroaches
to
name
just
a
few
</s>
<s>
Many
if
not
most
of
these
bioinspirations
carry
with
them
some
common
issues
and
features
which
happen
at
the
individual
level
promoting
very
similar
collective
emergent
phenomena
</s>
<s>
Thus
despite
using
different
biological
metaphors
as
inspiration
most
algorithms
present
a
similar
structure
and
it
is
possible
to
identify
common
macro-processes
among
them
</s>
<s>
In
this
context
this
paper
identifies
a
set
of
common
features
among
some
well-known
swarm-based
algorithms
and
how
each
of
these
approaches
implement
them
</s>
<s>
By
doing
this
we
provide
the
community
with
the
core
features
of
swarm-intelligence
algorithms
</s>
<s>
This
diagnostic
is
crucial
and
timely
to
the
field
because
once
we
are
able
to
list
and
explain
these
commonalities
we
are
also
able
to
better
analyze
and
design
swarm
intelligence
algorithms
.
