Hybrid

In
this
paper
a
hybrid
model
which
combines
genetic
algorithm
and
heuristics
like
remove-sharp
and
local-opt
with
ant
colony
system
ACS
has
been
implemented
to
speed-up
convergence
as
well
as
positive
feedback
and
optimizes
the
search
space
to
generate
an
efficient
solution
for
complex
problems

<s>
This
model
is
validated
with
well-known
travelling
salesman
problem
TSP
</s>
<s>
Finally
performance
and
complexity
analysis
show
that
proposed
nested
hybrid
ACS
has
faster
convergence
rate
than
other
standard
existing
algorithms
such
as
exact
and
approximation
algorithms
to
reach
the
optimal
solution

The
standard
TSP
problems
from
the
TSP
library
are
also
tested
and
found
satisfactory
