Swarm
intelligence
is
a
kind
of
artificial
intelligence
that
is
based
on
the
collective
behavior
of
the
decentralized
and
self-organized
systems
</s>
<s>
This
work
focuses
on
reviewing
a
heuristic
global
optimization
method
called
particle
swarm
optimization
PSO
</s>
<s>
This
includes
the
mathematical
representation
of
PSO
in
contentious
and
binary
spaces
the
evolution
and
modifications
of
PSO
over
the
last
two
decades
</s>
<s>
We
also
present
a
comprehensive
taxonomy
of
heuristic-based
optimization
algorithms
such
as
genetic
algorithms
tabu
search
simulated
annealing
cross
entropy
and
illustrate
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
these
algorithms

Furthermore
we
present
the
application
of
PSO
on
graphics
processing
unit
and
show
various
applications
of
PSO
in
networks
