We
analyze
the
relation
between
robustness
to
mutations
phenotypic
complexity
and
evolvability
in
the
context
of
artificial
circuits
evolved
for
the
ability
to
solve
a
parity
problem
</s>
<s>
We
demonstrate
that
whether
robustness
to
mutations
enhances
or
diminishes
phenotypic
variability
and
evolvability
depends
on
whether
robustness
is
achieved
through
the
development
of
parsimonious
phenotypically
simple
solutions
that
minimize
the
number
of
genes
playing
functional
roles
or
through
phenotypically
more
complex
solutions
capable
of
buffering
the
effect
of
mutations
</s>

We
show
that
the
characteristics
of
the
selection
process
strongly
influence
the
robustness
and
the
performance
of
the
evolving
candidate
solutions

Finally
we
propose
a
new
evolutionary
method
that
outperforms
evolutionary
algorithms
commonly
used
