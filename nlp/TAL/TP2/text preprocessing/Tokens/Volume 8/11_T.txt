Natural
and
artificial
dynamical
systems
in
the
real
world
often
have
dynamics
at
multiple
time
scales

Such
dynamics
can
contribute
substantially
to
the
complexity

a
dynamical
system

increase
the
difficulty

which
it

analyzed

Although
evolutionary

have
been
proposed
that
are
amenable

multiple

We
propose
a

combines
an

In
