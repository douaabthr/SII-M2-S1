The
anatomy
of
the
fitness
landscape
for
the
quadratic
assignment
problem
is
studied
in
this
paper
</s>
<s>
We
study
the
properties
of
both
random
problems
and
real-world
problems
</s>
<s>
Using
auto-correlation
as
a
measure
for
the
landscape
ruggedness
we
study
the
landscape
of
the
problems
and
show
how
this
property
is
related
to
the
problem
matrices
with
which
the
problems
are
represented

<s>
Our
main
goal
in
this
paper
is
to
study
new
properties
of
the
fitness
landscape
which
have
not
been
studied
before
and
we
believe
are
more
capable
of
reflecting
the
problem
difficulties
</s>
<s>
Using
local
search
algorithm
which
exhaustively
explore
the
plateaus
and
the
local
optima
we
explore
the
landscape
store
all
the
local
optima
we
find
and
study
their
properties
</s>
<s>
The
properties
we
study
include
the
time
it
takes
for
a
local
search
algorithm
to
find
local
optima
the
number
of
local
optima
the
probability
of
reaching
the
global
optimum
the
expected
cost
of
the
local
optima
around
the
global
optimum
and
the
basin
of
attraction
of
the
global
and
local
optima
</s>
<s>
We
study
the
properties
for
problems
of
different
sizes
and
through
extrapolations
we
show
how
the
properties
change
with
the
system
size
and
why
the
problem
becomes
harder
as
the
system
size
grows
</s>
<s>
In
our
study
we
show
how
the
real-world
problems
are
similar
to
or
different
from
the
random
problems
</s>
<s>
We
also
try
to
show
what
properties
of
the
problem
matrices
make
the
landscape
of
the
real
problems
be
different
from
or
similar
to
one
another
