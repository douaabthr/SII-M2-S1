Sequence
labeling
is
an
interesting
classification
domain
where
like
normal
classification
every
input
has
a
class
label
but
unlike
normal
classification
prediction
of
an
input
s
label
may
depend
on
the
values
of
other
inputs
or
their
classes
and
so
a
learner
may
need
to
refer
to
inputs
and
classes
at
different
time
stamps
to
classify
the
current
input
</s>
<s>
This
is
more
difficult
because
a

does
not

where

Towards

a

variable-length

a

In
sequence

the

fixed-length
