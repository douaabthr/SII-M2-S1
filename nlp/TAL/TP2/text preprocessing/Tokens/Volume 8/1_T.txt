Special
issue
on
creative
intelligence
</s>
<s>
Creativity
and
intelligence
are
both
terms
that
have
been
deeply
studied
for
centuries
but
still
generate
debates
</s>
<s>
Scholars
frequently
relate
both
terms
establishing
connections
that
allow
us
to
understand
the
relationship
between
general
intelligence
and
creativity
</s>
<s>
Both
are
considered
required
for
addressing
challenging
problems
and
also
for
creating
art
or
appealing
designs

Music
literature
architecture
painting
crafts
industrial
design
they
all
benefit
from
a
better
understanding
and
conceptualization
of
the
processes
behind
creativity
and
intelligence
</s>
<s>
Although
computers
have
exceeded
the
capabilities
of
humans
in
a
number
of
limited
domains
human
creativity
generally
remains
unchallenged
and
only
recently
some
techniques
such
as
computational
intelligence
have
begun
to
address
problems
related
to
creativity

Computational
intelligence
CI
is
a
term
that
embodies
a
number
of
nature-inspired
techniques
such
as
evolutionary
computation
neural
networks
fuzzy
logic
systems
as
well
as
related
techniques
derived
from
them
such
as
swarm
optimization
artificial
immune
systems
and
ant
colony
optimization
to
name
but
a
few
</s>
<s>
CI
is
nowadays
applied
routinely
to
solve
complex
real
life
problems
</s>
<s>
Despite
the
great
variety
of
methods
and
applications
only
very
recently
have
researchers
considered
the
capabilities
of
CI
when
applied
to
creative
processes
</s>
<s>
Nevertheless
there
is
a
long
way
to
go
before
we
may
find
a
general
model
for
creativity
and
its
relationship
with
intelligence
.
The
interest
for
the
synergies
between
computational
intelligence
and
creativity
propelled
the
creation
in
2012
of
the
IEEE
Creative
Intelligence
Task
Force
which
has
since
then
organized
a
number
of
activities
around
the
area
including
special
sessions
in
the
main
conferences
and
art
exhibits
around
the
world
.
The
special
issue
we
introduce
here
is
part
of
the
task
force
s
ongoing
effort
to
promote
and
disseminate
research
in
the
area
and
it
was
announced
with
the
idea
of
publishing
extended
and
improved
versions
of
selected
works
from
the
special
sessions
previously
organized
in
Brisbane
2013
and
Beijing
2014
.
