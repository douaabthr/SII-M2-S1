XCSF

</s>
<s>
Tile
coding
is
an
effective
reinforcement
learning
method
that
uses
a
rather
ingenious
generalization
mechanism
based
on
1
a
carefully
designed
parameter
setting
and
2
the
assumption
that
nearby
states
in
the
problem
space
will
correspond
to
similar
payoff
predictions
in
the
action-value
function
</s>
<s>
Previously
we
extended
XCSF
with
tile
coding
prediction
and
compared
it
to
tabular
tile
coding
showing
that
1
XCSF
performs
as
well
as
parameter-optimized
tile
coding
while
also
2
evolving
individualized
parameter
settings
in
each
problem
subspace
</s>
<s>
Our
comparison
was
based
on
a
set
of
well-known
reinforcement
learning
environments
2D
Gridworld
and
the
Mountain
Car
that
involved
no
action-value
discontinuities
and
so
posed
no
challenge
to
tabular
tile
coding

<s>
In
this
paper
we
go
a
step
further
and
test
XCSF
with
tile
coding
on
a
set
of
problems
designed
to
challenge
tile
coding
by
introducing
discontinuities
in
the
action
value
landscape
</s>
<s>
The
new
testbed
called
MazeWorld
extends
2D
Gridworld
with
impenetrable
obstacles
a
conceptually
simple
modification
that
can
dramatically
increase
the
problem
complexity
for
tabular
tile
coding

<s>
We
compare
four
versions
of
XCSF
with
tile
coding
each
adapting
a
different
set
of
parameters
to
tabular
tile
coding
on
four
problems
of
increasing
complexity
</s>
<s>
We
show
that
our
system
1
needs
fewer
training
problems
than
standard
tile
coding
to
reach
an
optimal
policy
2
it
can
evolve
adequate
coding
parameters
in
each
subspace
without
any
previous
knowledge
and
that
3
even
when
XCSF
is
not
allowed
to
evolve
these
parameters
the
genetic
algorithm
will
still
adapt
classifier
conditions
to
properly
decompose
the
problem
into
subspaces
thus
being
much
less
sensitive
to
the
parameter
settings
than
tabular
tile
coding
.
