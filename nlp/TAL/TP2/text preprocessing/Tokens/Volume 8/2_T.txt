A

We
introduce
a
novel
evolutionary
algorithm
EA
with
a
semantic
network-based
representation
</s>
<s>
For
enabling
this
we
establish
new
formulations
of
EA
variation
operators
crossover
and
mutation
that
we
adapt
to
work
on
semantic
networks
</s>
<s>
The
algorithm
employs
commonsense
reasoning
to
ensure
all
operations
preserve
the
meaningfulness
of
the
networks
using
ConceptNet
and
WordNet
knowledge
bases
</s>
<s>
The
algorithm
can
be
interpreted
as
a
novel
memetic
algorithm
MA
given
that
1
individuals
represent
pieces
of
information
that
undergo
evolution
as
in
the
original
sense
of
memetics
as
it
was
introduced
by
Dawkins
and
2
this
is
different
from
existing
MA
where
the
word
memetic
has
been
used
as
a
synonym
for
local
refinement
after
global
optimization
</s>
<s>
For
evaluating
the
approach
we
introduce
an
analogical
similarity-based
fitness
measure
that
is
computed
through
structure
mapping

This
setup
