In

The
proposed
L1-LRC
for
orange
origin
identification
is
based
on
minimum
reconstruction
error
using
the
L1-norm
regularization
learning
method
which
can
combine
the
feature

classifier
learning

can

The
experimental
results
show
that
the
proposed
L1-LRC
model
can
achieve
higher
accuracy
rate
of
92.35%
and
perform
much
better
than
existing

Thus
this
