The
aim
of
video
super-resolution
SR
is
to
produce
a
high-resolution
HR
video
frame
from
numerous
successive
low-resolution
LR
frames
</s>
<s>
Even
though
there
are
a
large
number
of
techniques
employed
for
the
video
SR
all
these
existing
techniques
face
a
hectic
challenge
at
various
conditions

Thus
this
paper
proposes
an
effective
video
resolution
strategy
using
the
hybrid
Support

Actor

Neural
Network
SVR
ACNN
model
for
video

The
SR
images
formed
using

model

ACNN
are
integrated

<s>
The
ACNN
is
tuned
optimally
by
the
proposed
Fractional-based
Sine
Cosine
algorithm
F-SCA
which
is
responsible
for
the
global

convergence

<s>
The
experimentation
of
the
proposed
method
utilizes
three
videos
taken
from
the
Cambridge-driving

the
results
are
analyzed
for
three

factors
</s>
<s>
The
results
prove
that
the
proposed
model
offers
a
better

with
a
