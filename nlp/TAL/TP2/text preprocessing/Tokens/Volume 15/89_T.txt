The

four
stages

Classification

<s>
Initially
the
scanned
handwritten
document

Devanagari
language
is
subjected
to
pre-processing
which
includes
stages
like
RGB

gray
thresholding
complement
of
image
morphological
operations
linearization
and
noise
removal
using
Median
Filter

Then
the
characters

the
pre-processed

segmented

k-means
clustering

Further
the
features
