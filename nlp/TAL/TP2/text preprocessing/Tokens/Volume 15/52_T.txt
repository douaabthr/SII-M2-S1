This
paper
introduces
an
automatic
method
of
dietary
assessment
by
proposing
the
Imperialist
Competitive
Algorithm
IpCA
based
Deep
Belief
Network
IpCA-DBN
for
food
category
recognition
and
the
calorie
estimation
of
the
food
</s>
<s>
Initially
the
food
image
is
pre-processed
and
subjected
to
the
segmentation
process
which
is
done
by
the
Bayesian
Fuzzy
Clustering
</s>
<s>
Then
the
features
such
as
shape
color
histogram
wavelet
scattering
transform
features
are
generated
from
the
optimal
segments
</s>
<s>
Finally
these
features
are
fed
to
the
IpCA-DBN
for
recognizing
the
food
category
and
estimating
the
calorie
of
the
food
</s>

The
experimentation
performed
using
the
UNIMIB2016
dataset
enables
the
effective
analysis
of
the
proposed
method
in
terms
of
the
metrics
such
as
Macro

MSE
</s>
<s>
The
analysis
proves
that
the
proposed
method
outperforms
the
existing
methods
and
attained
0.9643
