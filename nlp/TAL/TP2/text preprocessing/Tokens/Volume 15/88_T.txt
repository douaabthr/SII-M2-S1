This

presents
the

mining
by
constraint-based
objective

The
proposed
method
uses
the
Frequent

algorithm
for
mining
the
association
rules
from
the

At
first
the
FP-Growth
algorithm
extracts
the
FPs
from
the
database
by
applying
the
support
threshold
and
then
generates
the
association
rules
from
the
FPs
by
applying
the
confidence
threshold

Then
the
generated
association
rules
are
processed
by
the
GA
for
producing
the
privacy
preserved

rules
while
preserving
the
sensitive
rules

Finally

The

The
experimental
results
show
that
the

mines
the
