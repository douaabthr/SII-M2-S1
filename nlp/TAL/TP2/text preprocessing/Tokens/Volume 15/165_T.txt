Seeking
a

The
major
issue
for
optimization
with
genetic
algorithms
GAs
is
getting
stuck
on
a
local
optimum
or
a
low
computation
efficiency
</s>
<s>
In
this
research
we
propose
a
new
real-coded
based
crossover
operator
by
using
the
Exponentiated
Pareto
distribution
EPX
which
aims
to
preserve
the
two
extremes
</s>
<s>
We
used
EPX
with
three
the
most
reputed
mutation
operators
Makinen
Periaux
and
Toivanen
mutation
MPTM
non
uniform
mutation
NUM
and
power
mutation
PM
</s>
<s>
The
experimental
results
with
eighteen
well-known
models
depict
that
our
proposed
EPX
operator
performs
better
than
the
other
competitive
crossover
operators

Significance

EPX
vs

Hence
the
new
crossover
scheme
appears
to
be
significant
