The
Vortex
Search
Algorithm
VSA
is
a
meta-heuristic
algorithm
that
has
been
inspired
by
the
vortex
phenomenon
proposed
by
Dogan
and
Olmez
in
2015
</s>
<s>
Like
other
meta-heuristic
algorithms
the
VSA
has
a
major
problem
it
can
easily
get
stuck
in
local
optimum
solutions
and
provide
solutions
with
a
slow
convergence
rate
and
low
accuracy
</s>
<s>
Thus
chaos
theory
has
been
added
to
the
search
process
of
VSA
in
order
to
speed
up
global
convergence
and
gain
better
performance

<s>
In
the
proposed
method
various
chaotic
maps
have
been
considered
for
improving
the
VSA
operators
and
helping
to
control
both
exploitation
and
exploration

The
performance

evaluated
with
24

In
addition
it

The
results

simulation
showed

chaotic
maps

the
Tent

able

Furthermore
it
was
clearly
shown
the
