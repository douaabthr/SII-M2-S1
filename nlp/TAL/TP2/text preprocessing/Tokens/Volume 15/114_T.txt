As
stated
by
a
mass
marketing
technique
the
objective
of
market-based
companies
is
to
maximize
the
product
of
targeted
direct
marketing
campaigns
other
than
reaching
prospects
and
customers
differently
</s>
<s>
The
maximum
return
of
the
direct

campaigns
is
based

an

This
paper
plans
to
develop
a
new
direct
marketing
campaign
model
in
banking
applications
using
a
hybrid
deep
learning
architecture
</s>
<s>
The
proposed
model
consists
of
several
steps
like
a
Data
acquisition
b
Optimal
feature
selection
and
c
prediction
</s>
<s>
Initially
the
direct
marketing
campaign
data
corresponding
to
banking
applications
are
collected
from
other
Google
sites
like
Portuguese
banking
institutions
</s>
<s>
With
the
collected
information
optimal
feature
selection
is
performed
in
order
to
reduce
the
dimension
of
the
attribute
or
feature
vector
thus
can
reduce
the
complexity
of
the
prediction
algorithm
</s>
<s>
Here
the
optimal
feature
selection
is
performed
by
a
new
variant
of
a
meta-heuristic
algorithm
termed
as
Self
Adaptive-Sea
Lion
Optimization
SA-SLnO
Algorithm
</s>
<s>
Further
the
optimally
collected
features
are
subjected
to
deep
hybrid
learning
with
the
integration
of
Deep
Belief
Network
DBN
and
Recurrent
Neural
Network
RNN
</s>
<s>
As
an
improvement
to
the
deep
learning
model
the
hidden
neurons
of
both
DBN
and
RNN
are
optimized
by
the
same
SA-SLnO
</s>
<s>
The
outcome
of
the
hybrid
classifier
is
the
decision
of
the
customer
on
banking
deposits

<s>
Finally
the
performance
of
the
proposed
model
is
certified
by
comparing
over
the
conventional
methods
through
the
evaluation
of

measures
