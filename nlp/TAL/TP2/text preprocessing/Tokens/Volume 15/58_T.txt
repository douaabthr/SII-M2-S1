In
recent
years
security

mobile

network
MANET
is
the
active
research
topic
in
both
industry
and
academia
because
of
the
rising
availability
of
tiny
adapted
mobile
devices
and
the
multipath
routing
protocols
have
been
received
much
attention
in
MANET

Accordingly
this
paper
introduces
the
trust-based
topology-hiding
multipath
routing
algorithm
for
the
MANET

The
proposed
model
finds
the
security

are

the
defined
security

The
proposed
routing
method
has
four
models
for
defining
the

the

delay

the
mobility
