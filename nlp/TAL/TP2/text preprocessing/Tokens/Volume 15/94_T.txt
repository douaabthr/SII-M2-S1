Three
different
methods
of
electricity
market
prices
are
formulated
in
turns
and
the
generation
cost
is
evaluated
for
each
method
to
sort
out
the
best
among
them
which
yields
the
least
generation
cost
of
the
same
microgrid
system

Both
active

Numerical

proved
to
be
the
most

economic

Also
during
