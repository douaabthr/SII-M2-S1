Glowworm
swarm
based
fuzzy
classifier
with
dual
features
for
speech
emotion
recognition
</s>
<s>
Nowadays
a
great
attention
is
focusing
on
the
study
of
the
emotional
content
in
speech
signals
since
the
speech
signal
is
one
of
the
quickest
and
natural
tactic
to
communicate
among
humans
and
thus
many
systems
have
been
suggested
to
recognize
the
emotional
content
of
a
spoken
utterance

This
paper
schemes
two
contributions
Gender
recognition
and
Emotion
recognition
</s>
<s>
In
the
first
contribution
there
has
two
phases
feature
extraction
and
classification
</s>
<s>
The
pitch
feature
is
extracted
and
given
for
classification
using
k-Nearest
Neighboring
classifier
</s>
<s>
In
the
second
contribution
features
like
Non-Negative
Matrix
Factorization
and
pitch
are
extracted
and
given
as
the
input
to
Adaptive
Fuzzy
classifier
to
recognize
the
respective
emotions

In
addition
the
limits
of
membership
functions
are
optimally
chosen
using
a
renowned
optimization
algorithm
namely
glowworm

GSO

Thus
the
proposed

The
