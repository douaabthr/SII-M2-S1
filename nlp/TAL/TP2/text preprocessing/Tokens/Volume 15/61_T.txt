Recently
wireless
sensor
networks
WSNs
are
becoming
very
famous
as
they
are
inexpensive
and
easy
to
maintain
and
manage
</s>
<s>
The
network
contains
a
group
of
sensor
nodes
which
are
capable
of
sensing
computing
and
transmitting

<s>
Energy
efficiency
is
one
of
the
most
important
challenging
problems
in
WSN
</s>
<s>
Sensor
nodes
have
inadequate
energy
and
installed
in
remote
areas

Hence
it
is
difficult
to
restore
the
batteries
in
WSN

Therefore
to
maximize
the

appropriate

should
be
implemented

The
main
idea
behind
the
clustering
technique
is
that
it
clusters
the
sensor
nodes
and
reduces
the
composed
data
simultaneously
and
then
it
broadcasts
the
data
</s>
<s>
In
this
process
CH
selection
is
an
essential
part

<s>
Therefore
this
survey
paper
provides
an
overview
of
the
clustering
techniques
for
reducing
energy
consumption
by
reviewing
several
CH
selection
techniques
in
WSN
that
provide
high
energy
efficiency
</s>
<s>
Several
techniques
have
been
employed
for
CH
selection
based
on
partitional
clustering
optimization
low-energy
adaptive
clustering
hierarchy
hierarchical

and
other

Finally
an
analysis
is
done
based

the
