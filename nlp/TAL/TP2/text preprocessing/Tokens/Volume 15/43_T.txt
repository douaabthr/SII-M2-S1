Cognitive
radio
CR
system
has
been
considered
as
the
key
technology
for
the
mobile
computing
and
wireless
communication
in
future

<s>
However
the
main
challenge
of
the
CR
system
is
the
allocation
of
resources
with
minimized
transmission
power
at
an
enhanced
rate
of
transmission

This
paper
proposes
the
hybrid
method
which
is
the
combination
of
Grey
Wolf
Optimization
GWO
and
Group
Search
Optimization
GSO
to
allocate
the
resources
in
the
CR
system
in
an
optimal
manner

It
simulates
the
GWOGS-based
CR
system
relying
on
the
orthogonal

division
multiplexing
OFDM
to
allocate
the
recourses
optimally

After
attaining
the
respective
simulation
it
compares
the
performance
of
the
GWOGS

the
conventional

In
addition
