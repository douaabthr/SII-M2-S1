A
novel
authentication
and
authorization
scheme
in
P2P
networking
using
location-based
privacy
</s>
<s>
In
recent
years
peer-to-peer
P2P
network
has
reached
popularity
in
file
sharing
as
it
is
a
distributed
and
decentralized
network
architecture
</s>
<s>
As
there
is
no
centralized
authority
there
arise
various
attacks
which
lead
to
insecurity
in
the
network
</s>
<s>
Thus
the
security
issues
of
the
P2P
networks
are
to
be
considered
with
more
care
</s>
<s>
This
paper
proposes
an
authentication
and
authorization
approach
named
fuzzy
enabled
advanced
encryption
standard
AES
based
multi-level
authentication
and
authorization
to
offer
security
against
various
kinds
of
attacks
that
occur
in
the
P2P
networks
</s>
<s>
Here
the
authentication
is
carried
out
with
the
security
factors
namely
location
profile
one-time
password
spatial
information
session
password
a
hashing
function
and
so
on
</s>
<s>
Initially
the
user
and
the
server
are
registered
in
the
authentication
process
and
then
hashing
functions
and
AES
are
used
to
perform
multi-level
authorization
and
authentication
processes
</s>
<s>
Thus
the
proposed
scheme
improves
the
security
of
the
P2P
network
</s>
<s>
Using
the
proposed
system
the
hit
ratio
obtained
is
0.9
and
the
success
rate
is
