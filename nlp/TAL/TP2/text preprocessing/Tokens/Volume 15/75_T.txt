Roadmap

distillery
spent

treatment

<s>
Distillery
industries
in
several
regions
all
over
the
world
pose
a
serious
risk
as
it
generates
unpleasant
compounds

Under
such
circumstances
it
seeks
an
effective
spent
wash
treatment
to
eliminate
the
contaminants
</s>
<s>
Accordingly
this
paper
provides
a
relevant
review
regarding
the
distillery
spent
wash
treatments
associated
with
the
proper
treatments
and
coagulants
</s>
<s>
At
first
it
reviews
67
recent
research
papers
from
which
24
papers
belong
to
distillery
spent
wash
treatment
and
remaining
belongs
to
other
treatments
</s>
<s>
Further
it
extends
the
valuable
chronological
review
on
distillery
spent
wash
treatment
</s>
<s>
In
addition
it
describes
the
several
processes
such
as
anaerobic
treatment
aerobic
treatment
nanofiltration
reverse
osmosis
adsorption
and
electrochemical
treatments
adopted
to
treat
distillery
spent
wash
as
reported
in
the
literature
</s>
<s>
In
the
same
way
it
analyses
the
usage
of
different
types
of
coagulants
such
as
natural
electro
and
chemical
coagulants
used
in
distillery
spent
wash
treatment

To
the
next
of
the
coagulant
analysis
it

out

The
conventional
process
for
distillery
spent
wash
treatment
having
limitations
such
as
limited
removal
efficiency
high
operating
cost
and
maintenance
also
it
needs
a
high
detention
time
that
eventually
increases
the

the
whole
treatment
process
time
</s>
<s>
The
aforesaid
limitation
can
be
overcome
by
adopting
soft
computing
techniques
</s>
<s>
Soft
computing
has
been
widely
studied
and
applied
in
the
past
three
decades
for
engineering
and
scientific
research
computing
</s>
<s>
In
environmental
engineering
engineers
and
researchers
have
effectively
used
various
techniques
of
soft
computing
like
fuzzy
logic
artificial
neural
networks
adaptive
neuro-fuzzy
inference
systems
and
support
vector
machines
which
can
be
useful
for
the
researchers
to
achieve
further
research
on
distillery
spent
wash
treatment
