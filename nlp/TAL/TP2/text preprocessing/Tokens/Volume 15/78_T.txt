One
of
the
dreadful

in
the
medical
industry
is
prostate
cancer

it
is
growing
at
a

Hence
it

This

presents
the
prostate

method
using

At
first
the
input
image
is
fed
to
the
pre-processing
step

then
the
segmentation
is
performed
using
Color
Space
transformation
and
thresholding
</s>

Once
the
segmentation
is
performed
the
feature
extraction
is
done
by
extracting
multiple

features
along
with
the
texture
features
that
are
extracted
based
on
local

improve
the
classification
accuracy

<s>
Finally
the
prostate
cancer
detection
is
done
based
on
the
proposed
fuzzy-based
SSA-RideNN
which
is
developed
by
integrating
fuzzy
approach
with
SSA-RideNN

The

<s>
The
proposed
fuzzy-based
SSA-RideNN
produces
the
maximum
accuracy
of
0.9190
a
maximum
sensitivity
