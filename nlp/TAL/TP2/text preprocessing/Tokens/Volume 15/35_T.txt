Clustering
method
and
sine
cosine
algorithm
for
image
segmentation
</s>
<s>
This
article
presents
a
new
image
segmentation
approach
based
on
the
principle
of
clustering
optimized
by
the
meta-heuristic
algorithm
namely
SCA
Algorithm
Sinus
Cosine
</s>
<s>
This
algorithm
uses
a
mathematical
model
based
on
trigonometric
functions
to
solve
optimization
problems
</s>
<s>
Such
an
approach
was
developed
to
solve
the
drawbacks
existing
in
classic
clustering
techniques
such
as
the
initialization
of
cluster
centers
and
convergence
towards
the
local
optimum
</s>
<s>
In
fact
to
obtain
an
optimal
cluster
center
and
to
improve
the
image
segmentation
quality
we
propose
this
technique
which
begins
with
the
generation
of
a
random
population
</s>
<s>
Then
we
determine
the
number
of
clusters
to
exploit
</s>
<s>
Later
we
formulate
an
objective
function
to
maximize
the
interclass
distance
and
minimize
the
intra-class
distance
</s>
<s>
The
resolution
of
this
function
gives
the
best
overall
solution
used
to
update
the
rest
of
the
population
</s>
<s>
The
performances
of
the
proposed
approach
are
evaluated
using
a
set
of
reference
images
and
compared
to
several
classic
clustering
methods
like
k-means
or
fuzzy
c-means
and
other
meta-heuristic
approaches
such
as
genetic
algorithms
and
particle
swarm
optimization

The
results
obtained
from
the
different
methods
are
analyzed
based
on
the

SC

the

The
