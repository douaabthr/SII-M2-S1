The

The
path

avoid

minimize

prevent

Thus
this
work
proposes
a
dynamic

scheme
for
routing
emergency

At
first
the
VANET

simulated

the

is
performed
after
the
arrival

emergency

The
proposed
dynamic
path
planning
includes
two
steps
namely
travel-time
forecasting

bi-model
routing

<s>
The
travel

predicted
using

the
bimodal

employed
to
route
the

optimally

The
bimodal

of
two
steps

K-path

Initially
the

The

designed

Thus
the

The

From
