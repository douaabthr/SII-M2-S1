As
embedded
pre-designed

pre-validated
cores
in
system-on-chip
SoC
designs
have
increased
usage
the
wrapper

design
WSCD
for
the

is
one
of
the
fundamental
ways
to

In
this
paper
a
chaotic
dragonfly
algorithm
CDA
for
WSCD
is
proposed
to
minimize
the
test
time
of
embedded
cores
by
balancing
the
packaged
scan
chains
WSCs
.
Since
the
WSCD
problem
is
non-continuous
we
improve
the
dragonfly
algorithm
DA
with
integer
coding
to
make
it
suitable
for
the
WSCD
problem

Furthermore
a
