In
this
paper
the
binary
classification
problem
is
considered
and
its
solution
is
proposed
as
the
formulated
classification
model
based
on
genetic
algorithm
GA
and
nonparallel
hyperplane
support
vector
machine
NHSVM

SNHSVM

<s>
As
GA
provably
violates
the
non-revisiting
condition
of
the
no-free-lunch
theorems

optimization
NFLO
then
SNHSVM
have
the
natural
property
that
NFLO

not
apply

it

All
the
experiments
are
performed

The
hypothesis

that
in

some
classifier
can
perform
better

The

are
performed
on

SNHSVM
achieves
the
highest
