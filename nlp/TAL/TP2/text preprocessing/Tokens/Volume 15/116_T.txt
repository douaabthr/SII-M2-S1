A

in
data
mining

machine
learning
is
feature
selection

The
crucial
part
is
how
to
specify
the
eminent
problem-relevant
features
out
of
a
collection
of
features
contained
in
a
dataset

Feature

process
goes

Thus
in
this

we
have
proposed
a
two-staged
hybrid
arrangement
of
model
that
contains
filter-based
approach
in
the
first
stage
to
filter
out
the
unnecessary

then
providing
these
acquired
features
as
input
to
the
next
stage
that
is
the
wrapper
method

availing
the
recent
swarm

algorithm

salp

algorithm

SSA

The
