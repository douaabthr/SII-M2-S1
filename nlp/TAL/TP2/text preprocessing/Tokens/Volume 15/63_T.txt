Enhancing

In
highway
construction
the
most
important
procedure
is
the
sub-grade
soil
stabilization

The
main
motive
of
this
research
paper
is
to
evaluate
the
value
of
industrial
and
agricultural
waste
as
the
soil
admixture
and
aimed
to
enhance

Especially
for
improving
the
alkaline

s
load-bearing
capacity
the
current
study
explains
the
behavioral
phase
of
alkaline

blended
along
waste
materials
of
industries
like
FA
TD
and
agricultural
waste
material
RHA
PM

The
analysis
is
made
to
find
the
effect
of
both
agricultural
and
industrial
wastes
on
specific
mix
proportions
on
distinct
soil
properties
like
OMC
MDD
UCS
and
CBR
and
the
comparison
is
also
made

The
results
conclude
all

FA

RHA

accomplish
its
optimal
