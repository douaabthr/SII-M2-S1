This
paper
proposes
a
new
algorithm
for
detecting
and
generating
simple
circuits
within
a
directed
graph
</s>
<s>
Before
generating
all
simple
circuits
in
a
directed
graph
the
algorithm
first
detects
whether
there
is
a
simple
circuit
in
directed
graph
and
the
detection
can
divide
the
directed
graph
into
trivial
graphs
or
strongly
connected
components
</s>
<s>
In
the
process
of
detecting
the
existence
of
simple
circuit
the
algorithm
repeatedly
reduces
the
number
of
vertices
in
vertex
set
along
with
edge
pruning

Based
on
depth-first
traversal
we
can
get
all
simple

the

<s>
Especially
instead
of
proceeding
depth-first
traversals
based
on
all
vertices
the
algorithm
starts
with
a
random
vertex
in
a
strongly
connected
component
to
reduce
the
number
of
depth-first
traversals
and
obtain
all
simple
circuits
of
this
strongly
connected
component

The
difficulty
of
the
algorithm
is
to
detect
and
delete
the
repeated
circuits
in
the
process
of
generating
all
simple
circuits
which
can
reduce
both
the
storage
space
and
time
complexity
</s>

As
a
result
the
output
of
the

does
not
contain
any
repeated

<s>
The
algorithm
simplifies
the
edge
set
of
directed
graphs
and
greatly
reduces
the
number
of
depth-first
traversals
thereby
reducing
the
computational
complexity
and
improving
the
computational
efficiency
