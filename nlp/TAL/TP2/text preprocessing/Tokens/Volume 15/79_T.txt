One
of
the
recent
ways
of
checking
the
internal
organs
such
as
kidneys
gallbladder
liver
and
spleen
is
using
an
abdominal
US
image

<s>
US
image
is
more
familiar
for
its
unique
characteristics
like
radiation-free
safe
cheaper

faster

However
the
thing
to
be
considered
is
that
US
images
cannot
grant
a
precise
view
of
affected
regions

More
particularly
the
unprocessed

This
paper
intends
to
propose
a
novel
model

detection
with
US
images

This

model
comprises
two
phases
feature
extraction

Classification

In
the
feature
extraction
process

are
extracted

AGLOH

Then
in
the
classification
stage
the
optimized
ISLSR
model
is
used
to
detect
whether
the
mass
is
present

abdomen

the
