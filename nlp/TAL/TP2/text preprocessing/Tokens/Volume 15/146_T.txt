Application
of

</s>
<s>
In
this
paper
a
new
gear
fault
recognition
method
was
proposed
by
using
morphological
wavelet
and
permutation
entropy
</s>
<s>
Firstly
the
morphological
Haar
wavelet
was
proposed
based
on
morphological
wavelet
and
it
was
used
to
pre-process
the
measured
gear
vibration
signal
</s>
<s>
Then
the
permutation
entropy
was
used
as
the
eigenvalue
of
gear
fault
to
be
extracted
from
the
vibration
signal
which
included
four
working
conditions
normal
mild
wear
moderate
wear
and
broken
teeth
</s>
<s>
Finally
according
to
different
faults
corresponding
to
different
permutation
entropy
distributions
the
various
fault
states
were
classified
and
the
permutation
entropy
distributions
of
non-denoised
signals
were
compared
</s>
<s>
It
could
be
seen
that
the
morphological
Haar
wavelet
had
good
de-noising
effectiveness
and
permutation
entropy
could
express
the
feature
of
different
gear
conditions
</s>
<s>
The
example
of
gear
fault
recognition
proved
that
the
combination
of
morphological
wavelet
and
permutation
entropy
could
effectively
improve
the
ability
of
gear
fault
classification
.
