<s>
The
traveling
salesman
problem
TSP
is
a
typical
problem
in
combinatorial
optimization
</s>
<s>
The
unique
objective
of
the
traditional
TSP
is
to
minimize
the
tour
distance
</s>
<s>
When
more
than
one
objective
is
taken
into
account
to
be
optimized
simultaneously
the
problem
is
known
as
a
multi-objective
TSP
</s>

In
the
present
paper
a
bi-objective
traveling
salesman
problem
BOTSP
is
considered
where
both
the
cost
and
the
distance
are
taken
as
optimization
objectives
</s>
<s>
We
introduce
a
new
algorithm
that
solves
the
BOTSP
called
Gw-ABC
</s>

This
algorithm
is
based
on
an
Artificial
Bee
Colony
Algorithm
ABC

uses

Firstly
we
apply

prepare
the
weight
vectors
</s>
<s>
In
fact
weight
vectors
values
are
gradually
distributed
in
the
objective
space
and
change
relatively
to
the
optimization
process
from
cycle
to
another

<s>
Secondly
we
apply
the
ABC
algorithm
with
the
generated
weights
to
our
problem

<s>
The
proposed
algorithm
is
experimentally
tested
on
well-known
benchmark
instances
of
different

The
