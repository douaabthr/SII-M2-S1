Evolutionary

ER

viewed

the
application

algorithms
evolutionary

<s>
When
considering
ER
as
black-box
optimization
the
selective
pressure
is
mainly
driven
by
a
user-defined
black-box
fitness
function
and
a
domain-independent
selection
procedure
</s>
<s>
However
most
ER
experiments
face
similar
challenges

similar
setups
the
selective

in
particular
the
fitness
function
is
not
a

box

The

because
ER

selective

ER
are

Besides
