Currently
the
vast

of
NeuroEvolutionary
methods
create
homogeneous
networks
of
user
defined
transfer
functions
</s>
<s>
This
is
despite
NeuroEvolution
being
capable
of
creating
heterogeneous
networks
where
each
neuron
s
transfer
function
is
not
chosen
by
the
user
but
selected
or
optimised
during
evolution
</s>
<s>
This
paper
demonstrates
how
NeuroEvolution
can
be
used
to
select
or
optimise
each
neuron
s
transfer
function
and
empirically
shows
that
doing
so
significantly
aids
training

This
result
is
important
as
the

of
NeuroEvolutionary

are
capable

creating
heterogeneous

using
the
methods
described
.
