Many

have

developed

These
SI-based
algorithms
can
have
some
advantages
over
traditional

In
this
paper
we
carry
out
a
critical
analysis
of
these
SI-based
algorithms
by
analyzing
their
ways
to
mimic
evolutionary
operators

We
also
analyze
the
ways
of
achieving
exploration
and
exploitation
in
algorithms
by
using
mutation
crossover
and
selection

In
addition
we
also
look
at
algorithms
using

Finally
we
provide
some

and
topics
for
