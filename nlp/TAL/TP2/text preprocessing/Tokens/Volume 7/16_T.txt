In
this
paper
we
study
the
cooperative
coevolutionary
algorithms
CCEAs
for
dynamic
optimization
</s>
<s>
We
introduce
the
CCEAs
with
two
popular
types
of
individuals
1
random
immigrants
RIs
that
increase
the
diversity
for
changing
environments
and
2
elitist
individuals
that
increase
the
local
convergence
to
the
optima
</s>
<s>
The
CCEAs
are
evaluated
on
a
standard
suite
of
benchmark
problems
and
are
compared
with
evolution
strategies
ES
</s>
<s>
Our
experimental
results
show
that
the
CCEAs
are
efficient
in
locating
and
tracking
optima
in
dynamic
environments
</s>
<s>
They
are
superior
to
the
ES
when
the
RI
individuals
and
the
elitist
individuals
are
used
</s>
<s>
In
addition
we
empirically
investigate
how
the
CCEAs
perform
with
different
parameter
settings
</s>
<s>
These
settings
include
collaboration
methods
the
use
of
plus
comma
selections
and
the
number
of
RI
individuals
and
elitist
individuals
</s>
<s>
We
also
investigate
the
CCEAs
that
use
a
mutativeσ-self
adaptation
</s>
<s>
The
CCEAs
perform
the
best
when
they
use
the
best
collaboration
method
and
the
plus
selection
</s>
<s>
The
use
of
the
mutativeσ-self
adaptation
is
insignificant
</s>
<s>
Our
results
also
show
that
the
CCEAs
are
more
scalable
than
the
ES
in
dynamic
environments
.
