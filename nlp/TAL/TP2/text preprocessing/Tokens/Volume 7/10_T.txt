Simultaneous

This
paper
is
concerned
with
the
problem
of
learning
multiple
skills
by
modular
robots
</s>
<s>
The
main
question
we
address
is
whether
it
is
better
to
learn
multiple
skills
simultaneously
all-at-once
or
incrementally
one-by-one
</s>
<s>
We
conduct
an
experimental
study
with
modular
robots
of
various
morphologies
that
need
to
acquire
three
different
but
correlated
skills
efficient
locomotion
navigation
towards
a
target
point
and
obstacle
avoidance
using
a
real-time
on-board
evolution
as
the
learning
method
</s>
<s>
The
results
indicate
that
the
one-by-one
strategy
is
more
efficient
and
more
stable
than
the
all-at-once
strategy
.
