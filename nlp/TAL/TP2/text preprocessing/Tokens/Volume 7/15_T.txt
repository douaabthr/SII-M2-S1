Since
their
inception
field
programmable
gate
arrays
have
seen
an
enormous
growth
in
usage
because
they
can
dramatically
reduce
design
and
manufacturing
costs
</s>

However
the
time
required

placement
a
key

in

design
is
dominating
the
compilation
process

<s>
In
this
paper
we
take
some
initial
theoretical
steps
towards
developing
an
efficient
genetic
algorithm
for
solving
the
placement
problem
by
developing
suitable
recombination
operators
for
performing
placement

According
to
Holland
when
the
genetic
algorithm
recombines
two
parent
genotypes
the
differences
between
them
define
a
genotypic
subspace
and
any
offspring
produced
should
be
confined
to
this
subspace
</s>
<s>
Those
recombination
operators
that
violate
this
principle
can
direct
a
search
away
from
the
region
containing
the
parent
genotypes
and
this
is
contrary
to
the
intended
task
for
recombination
</s>

This
is

performance

This
paper
contributes

development
of
an
intuitive
visualization
technique
that
can
be
used
to
easily
detect
violations
of
the
previous
principle

<s>
The
efficacy
of
the
proposed
methodology
is
demonstrated
and
it
is
demonstrated
that
many
standard
recombination
operators
violate
this
principle

<s>
The
methodology
is
then
used
to
guide
the
development
of
novel
operators
that
exhibit
substantial
and
statistically
significant
improvements
in
performance
over
standard
recombination
operators
