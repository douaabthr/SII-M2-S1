There

data

cancer
classification

oncogenomics

<s>
This
is
especially
true
since
the
disease
occurs
sporadically

Typically
gene

data
is
disproportionate

a
large
number

features

</s>
<s>
A
small
sample
size
is
likely
to
adversely
affect
accuracy
of
classification
as
the
performance
of
a
classifier
depends
largely
on
the

There
is
a
pressing
need
to
generate
data

be
provided

Primitive
augmentation
techniques

uniform

noise
do
not
assure

Secondly
as

deal

the

We
use
