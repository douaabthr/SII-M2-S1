This
paper
presents
an
experimental
comparison
among
four
automated
machine
learning
AutoML
methods
for
recommending
the
best
classification
algorithm
for
a
given
input
dataset
</s>
<s>
Three
of
these
methods
are
based
on
evolutionary
algorithms
EAs
and
the
other
is
Auto-WEKA
a
well-known
AutoML
method
based
on
the
combined
algorithm
selection
and
hyper-parameter
optimisation
CASH
approach
</s>
<s>
The
EA-based
methods
build
classification
algorithms
from
a
single
machine
learning
paradigm
either
decision-tree
induction
rule
induction
or
Bayesian
network
classification
</s>
<s>
Auto-WEKA
combines
algorithm
selection
and
hyper-parameter
optimisation
to
recommend
classification
algorithms
from
multiple
paradigms
</s>
<s>
We
performed
controlled
experiments
where
these
four
AutoML
methods
were
given
the
same
runtime
limit
for
different
values
of
this
limit
</s>
<s>
In
general
the
difference
in
predictive
accuracy
of
the
three
best
AutoML
methods
was
not
statistically
significant
</s>
<s>
However
the
EA
evolving
decision-tree
induction
algorithms
has
the
advantage
of
producing
algorithms
that
generate
interpretable
classification
models
and
that
are
more
scalable
to
large
datasets
by
comparison
with
many
algorithms
from
other
learning
paradigms
that
can
be
recommended
by
Auto-WEKA
</s>
<s>
We
also
observed
that
Auto-WEKA
has
shown
meta-overfitting
a
form
of
overfitting
at
the
meta-learning
level
rather
than
at
the
base-learning
level
.
