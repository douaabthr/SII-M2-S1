The
rapid
growth
of
electricity
demand
has
led
governments
around
the
world
to
implement
energy-conscious
policies
such
as
time-of-use
tariffs
</s>
<s>
The
manufacturing
sector
can
embrace
these
policies
by
implementing
an
innovative
scheduling
system
to
reduce
its
energy
consumption
</s>

Therefore
this
study
addresses
bi-objective
job-shop
scheduling
with
total

electricity
cost
minimization

To
solve
this

we
propose
a

Finally
