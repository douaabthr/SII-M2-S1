The
article
proposes
a
deep
learning-based
algorithm
that
performs
dynamic

the

cloudlet

aids
in
the
reduction

The
delay
in
performing
tasks
is
one
of
the
major
drawback
of
cloudlet
that
it
is
deprived
of
resources
when
compared
to
cloud
server

to
which
the
tasks
that
are
to
be
performed
are
divided

is
designated
to

cloudlet
itself
