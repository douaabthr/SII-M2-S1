Texture

is
one
of
the
most
important
challenges

This
paper
presents
a

approach
by
taking
the
combinations

robust

applied

GLRLM

extraction
</s>
<s>
The
purpose
of
selecting
the
GRLM
as
texture
descriptor
is
that
it
extracts
information
of
an
image
from
its
gray
level
runs

The
textured
materials
usually
go
through
a
deep
change
in
their

with
variations
in
illumination
and

<s>
For
instance
keeping
all
the
parameters
fixed

just
changing
the

rotation
can
result
in

Hence

Dealing
with
these
variations
successfully
by
utilizing
GRLM
descriptor
for
texture
classification

the
main

In
the

Experimental
results
on
the
Brodatz

show
that
the
suggested

improves
the
performance
significantly
as
