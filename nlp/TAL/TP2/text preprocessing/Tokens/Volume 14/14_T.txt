This
paper
presents
a
novel
simplified
mathematical
modeling
that
can
solve
a
path
planning
problem
comprising
three
agents
in
a
triangular
formation
</s>
<s>
The
problem
is
modeled
to
optimize
the
trajectories
of
the
agents
and
to
minimize
the
distances
traveled
</s>
<s>
The
trajectories
are
obtained
in
a
way
that
deviates
them
from
fixed
obstacles
whose
dimensions
are
known
</s>
<s>
Furthermore
geometry
and
orientation
constraints
of
the
formation
of
the
multi-agent
are
imposed
</s>
<s>
Heuristics
methods
such
as
the
Genetic
Algorithm
Differential
Evolution
and
Particle
Swarm
Optimization
are
applied
to
solve
the
non-linear
algebraic
equations
which
represent
the
system
</s>
<s>
Comparisons
are
presented
among
the
results
of
the
different
methods
highlighting
the

and
the
convergence

the

solution
</s>
<s>
The
results
prove
that
all
the
algorithms
can
be
applied
to
the
path
planning
problem
with

</s>
<s>
The
Particle
Swarm
Optimization
method
presents
the
lowest
processing
time
for
all
simulated

However
the
Differential
Evolution
method
is
more
robust
than

others
when
searching
for
the
