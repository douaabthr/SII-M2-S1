Local
search
can
be
introduced
into
genetic
algorithms
to
create
a
hybrid
but
any
improvement
in
performance
is
dependent
on
the
learning
mechanism

In

Lamarckian
model
a

In
the
Baldwinian
model
the

Experiments
have
shown
that
this
form
of
adaptive
learning
can
improve
the
ability
to
find
high-quality
solutions
and
can
accelerate
the
hybrid
search
without
the
need
to
find
optimal
control
parameters
for
the
learning
process
