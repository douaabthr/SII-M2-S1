One
of

issues

the

In
the
proposed

the
modified
operators
of
the
cuckoo
optimization
algorithm

the
genetic
algorithm
are
used
to
achieve
a
relatively
optimal
solution
with
fewer
repetitions

The
most

the
introduction

The
main
idea
of
this
operator
is
to
replace
linear

with
the
spiral
search
which
allows
local

accelerates
the
achievement

a
