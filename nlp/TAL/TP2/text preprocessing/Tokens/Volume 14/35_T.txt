In

the
use

As

pass
new

better
technologies
are
emerging

Initially
the

The
current
use
of
mobile

has
evolved

a
new

The
current
smart

provide
almost
all

It

There

thousands

mobile

most
of
these

communicate

Most
of
the
times
mobile
users
are
unaware

happening
around
them

<s>
The
main
idea
behind
this
work
is
to
provide
a
framework

notify
a
mobile

his
interests

near
him/her

The
data

be
generated

the
data
is
explicitly
updated

the

The
cloud

This
framework
may
be

define
any

make
them
available

on
interest
location
and
time

The
main
objective
of
the
proposed

to
identify
