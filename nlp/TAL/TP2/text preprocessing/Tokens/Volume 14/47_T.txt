</s>
<s>
From
past
decade
the
advancement
in
the
field
of
RDF
data
management
poses
many
challenges
to
researchers
</s>
<s>
Processing
large
volumes
of
RDF
data
is
very
difficult
task
in
the
cloud
</s>
<s>
The
RDF
data
actually
contains
complex
graphs
along
with
large
number
of
schemas
</s>
<s>
Distributing
the
RDF
data
with
traditional
approaches
or
partitioning
them
with
conventional
mechanism
leads
to
faulty
distribution
as
well
as
generated
large
number
of
join
operations
</s>
<s>
To
address
the
above
issues
this
paper
developed
architecture
for
distributed
query
processing
using
the
adaptive
hash
partitioning
approach
along
with
hash
join
operation
</s>
<s>
This
paper
also
developed
an
algorithm
for
executing
the
query
by
minimizing
the
joins
</s>
<s>
This
paper
presented
an
evaluation
of
the
proposed
model
with
other
standard
model
</s>
<s>
The
experimental
results
proved
that
the
proposed
method
had
faster
response
time
compared
to
the
other
standard
models
.
