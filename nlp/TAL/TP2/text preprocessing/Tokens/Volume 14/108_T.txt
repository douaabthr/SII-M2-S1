Quantum
Evolutionary
Algorithms
QEA
are
highly
suitable
for
the
class
of
combinatorial
optimization
problems
but
since
proposed
they
have
not
been
used
in
solving
this
problem
</s>
<s>
In
this
paper
we
develop
new
operators
for
QEA
to
improve
its
performance
in
solving
timetabling
problem
</s>
<s>
The
first
operator
we
develop
is
a
reinitialization
operator
which
checks
the
population
and
when
it
is
converged
reinitializes
it
to
maintain
the
diversity
</s>
<s>
The
other
operator
is
called
the
Diversity
Preserving
operator
which
monitors
the
q-individuals
and
if
it
finds
more
than
one
q-individuals
searching
around
the
same
local
optimum
reinitializes
some
of
them
to
make
sure
different
q-individuals
are
exploiting
different
regions
in
the
search
space
</s>
<s>
In
this
paper
we
also
study
the
population
size
and
the
population
structure
of
QEA
in
solving
timetabling
problem
</s>
<s>
In
order
to
test
the
proposed
algorithm
we
perform
experiments
and
compare
the
proposed
algorithm
to
the
existing
algorithms
on
some
well-known
benchmark
functions
