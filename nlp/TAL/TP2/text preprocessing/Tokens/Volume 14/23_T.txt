An
application

artificial

This
paper
develops
and
employs
a
novel
artificial
neural
network
ANN
model
to
study
farmers
behavior
towards
decision
making
on
maize
production
in
Kenya
</s>
<s>
The
paper
has
compared
the
accuracy
level
of
ANN
based
models
and
the
statistical
model
</s>
<s>
The
results
show
that
the
ANN
models
has
achieved
higher
accuracy
and
efficiency
</s>
<s>
The
findings
from
the
study
reveal
that
the
farmers
are
mostly
influenced
by
their
demographic
characteristics
and
food
security
conditions
in
their
decision
making
</s>
<s>
Further
to
examine
the
relative
importance
of
different
demographic
and
food
security
characteristics
an
ANOVA
test
is
undertaken
</s>
<s>
The
results
found
that
education
and
food
security
indices
are
instrumental
in
influencing
farmers
decision
making
