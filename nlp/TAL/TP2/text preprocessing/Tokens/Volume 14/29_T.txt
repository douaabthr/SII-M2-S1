Feature

methods
are
used
to
identify

remove
irrelevant

redundant
attributes

Meta-heuristic
feature

Genetic
Algorithm
GA
a
popular
meta-heuristic

Basically
GA
uses
mutation
operation
to
take
care

exploitation

has
certain
limitations

As
a

GA
gets
stuck
in
local

To

we
have
intelligently
blended
the
Great

with
GA

Here
GDA
is
used
in
place

Application
of
GDA
yields
a
high

DGA

We

Thus
our

introduction
