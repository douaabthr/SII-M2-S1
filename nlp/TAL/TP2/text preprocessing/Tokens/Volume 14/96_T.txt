In

the

algorithm
is
modified
to
find
an
approximate

NOCP

For
this
purpose
after
presenting
the
similarities
between
uncapacitated
single

p-Hub
median
problem
USApHMP
which
is
a
special
case
of
the
well-studied
hub
location
problem
and
a
discretized
form
of
NOCP
an
improvement
on
sequential

This
algorithm
that
denoted
as
new-sequential

neighborhood

N-SGVNS
is
based
on
three
local

that
use
efficient

In
addition
comparing
the
NOCP
with
the
USApHMP
has
led
us
to

solution
for
NOCP

Our
results
of
the
implementation
of

N-SGVNS
on
the
real-world
data

<s>
Because
of
the
proposed
algorithm
is
able
to
solve
the
USApHMP
successfully
we
hoped
that
this
method
would
also
be
successful
for
NOCP

<s>
Solving
of
benchmark
NOCP
and
then
comparing
the
results
of
the
N-SGVNS
with
recently
developed
algorithms
suggest
that
the
presented
strategy
may
provide
an
outstanding
framework
for
designing
cost-effective
control
functions
