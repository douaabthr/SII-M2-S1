Numerical
simplification
for
bloat
control
and
analysis
of
building
blocks
in
genetic
programming
</s>
<s>
In
tree-based
genetic
programming
there
is
a
tendency
for
the
size
of
the
programs
to
increase
from
generation
to
generation
a
phenomenon
known
as
bloat
</s>
<s>
It
is
standard
practice
to
place
some
form
of
control
on
program
size
either
by
limiting
the
number
of
nodes
or
the
depth
of
the
program
trees
or
by
adding
a
component
to
the
fitness
function
that
rewards
smaller
programs
parsimony
pressure

<s>
Others
have
proposed
directly
simplifying
individual
programs
using
algebraic
methods
</s>
<s>
In
this
paper
we
add
node-based
numerical
simplification
as
a
tree
pruning
criterion
to
control
program
size
</s>
<s>
We
investigate
the
effect
of
on-line
program
simplification
both
algebraic
and
numerical
on
program
size
and
resource
usage
</s>
<s>
We
also
investigate
the
distribution
of
building
blocks
within
a
genetic
programming
population
and
how
this
is
changed
by
using
simplification
</s>
<s>
We
show
that
simplification
results
in
reductions
in
expected
program
size
memory
use
and
computation
time
</s>
<s>
We
also
show
that
numerical
simplification
performs
at
least
as
well
as
algebraic
simplification
and
in
some
cases
will
outperform
algebraic
simplification
</s>
<s>
We
further
show
that
although
the
two
on-line
simplification
methods
destroy
some
existing
building
blocks
they
effectively
generate
new
more
diverse
building
blocks
during
evolution
which
compensates
for
the
negative
effect
of
disruption
of
building
blocks
.
