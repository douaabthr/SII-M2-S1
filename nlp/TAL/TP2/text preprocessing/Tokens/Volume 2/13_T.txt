This
paper
proposes
several
modifications
to
existing
hybrid
evolutionary
algorithms
in
grid-based
puzzles
using
a-priori
probabilities
of
0
1
occurrence
in
binary
encodings
</s>
<s>
This
calculation
of
a-priori
probabilities
of
bits
is
possible
in
grid-based
problems
puzzles
in
this
case
due
to
their
special
structure
with
the
solution
confined
into
a
grid
</s>
<s>
The
work
is
focused
in
two
different
grid-based
puzzles
the
Japanese
puzzles
and
the
Light-up
puzzle
each
one
having
special
characteristics
in
terms
of
constraints
which
must
be
taken
into
account
for
the
probabilities
of
bit
calculation
</s>
<s>
For
these
puzzles
we
show
the
process
of
a-priori
probabilities
calculation
and
we
modify
the
initialization
of
the
EAs
to
improve
their
performance
</s>
<s>
We
also
include
novel
mutation
operators
based
on
a-priori
probabilities
which
makes
more
effective
the
evolutionary
search
of
the
algorithms
in
the
tackled
puzzles

The
performance

the
algorithms
with
these
new
initialization

novel

operators
is
compared

the
performance

<s>
We
show
that
the
new
initialization
and
operators
based
on
a-priori
probabilities
of
bits
make
the
evolutionary

more
effective
and
also
improve
the
scalability
of
the
