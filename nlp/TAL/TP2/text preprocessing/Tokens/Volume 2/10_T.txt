We
present
an
approach
to
build
sequential
decision
making
problems
which
can
test
the
generalization
capabilities
of
classifier
systems
</s>
<s>
The
approach
can
be
applied
to
any
sequential
problem
defined
over
a
binary
domain
and
it
generates
a
new
problem
with
bounded
sequential
difficulty
and
bounded
generalization
difficulty

As
an
example
we
applied
the
approach
to
generate
two
problems
with
simple
sequential
structure
huge
number
of
states
more
than
a
million
and
many
generalizations

XCS

The
experimental
results
confirm
what
was
previously
found
mainly
using
single-step
problems
also
in
sequential
problems
with
huge

spaces
XCS
can
generalize
effectively
by
detecting
those

are

optimal
