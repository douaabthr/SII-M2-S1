Special

The
field

natural

one
of
the
fastest
growing
areas
in
computer
science

engineering

Although
its
origins
can
be
traced
back
to
the
cybernetics
movement
of
the
1950s
it
has
undergone
a
renaissance
since
the
mid-1980
s
primarily
due
to
the
fundamental
work
by
pioneers
for
example
John
Holland
Ken
De
Jong
David
Goldberg
John
Koza
Lawrence
Fogel
in
the
genetic
and

have
been
applied
successfully

The
four
papers
included
in

were
among
the
invited
submissions
from
SEAL08
the
7th
International
Conference
on
Simulated
Evolution

Each
of
the
submitted
papers
was
substantially
revised

The
extended
papers
were

rigorously
reviewed
