Exploiting
the
information
in
low
quality
datasets
has
been
recently
acknowledged
as
a
new
challenge
in
Genetic
Fuzzy
Systems
</s>
<s>
Owing
to
this
in
this
paper
we
discuss
the
basic
principles
that
govern
the
extension
of
a
fuzzy
rule
based
classifier
to
interval
and
fuzzy
data
</s>
<s>
We
have
also
applied
these
principles
to
the
genetic
learning
of
a
simple
cooperative-competitive
algorithm
that
becomes
the
first
example
of
a
Genetic
Fuzzy
Classifier
able
to
use
low
quality
data
</s>
<s>
Additionally
we
introduce
a
benchmark
comprising
some
synthetic
samples
and
two
real-world
problems
that
involve
interval
and
fuzzy-valued
data
that
can
be
used
to
assess
future
algorithms
of
the
same
kind
.
