In
this
paper
we
propose
a
multi-objective
evolutionary
algorithm
MOEA
to
generate
Mamdani
fuzzy
rule-based
systems
with
different
trade-offs
between
accuracy
and
complexity
by
learning
concurrently
granularities
of
the
input
and
output
partitions
membership
function
MF
parameters
and
rules
</s>
<s>
To
this
aim
we
introduce
the
concept
of
virtual
and
concrete
partitions
the
former
is
defined
by
uniformly
partitioning
each
linguistic
variable
with
a
fixed
maximum
number
of
fuzzy
sets
the
latter
takes
into
account
for
each
variable
the
number
of
fuzzy
sets
determined
by
the
evolutionary
process
</s>
<s>
Rule
bases
and
MF
parameters
are
defined
on
the
virtual
partitions
and
whenever
a
fitness
evaluation
is
required
mapped
to
the
concrete
partitions
by
employing
appropriate
mapping
strategies

The
implementation
of
the
MOEA
relies
on
a
chromosome
composed
of
three
parts
which
codify
the
partition
granularities
the
virtual
rule
base
and
the
membership
function
parameters
respectively
and
on
purposely-defined
genetic
operators
</s>
<s>
The
MOEA
has
been
tested
on
three
real-world
regression
problems
achieving
very
promising
results
</s>
<s>
In
particular
we
highlight
how
starting
from
randomly
generated
solutions
the
MOEA
is
able
to
determine
different
granularities
for
different
variables
achieving
good
trade-offs
between
complexity
and
accuracy
.
