Understanding
how
cooperative
behavior
emerges
within
a
population
of
autonomous
individuals
has
been
the
focus
of
a
great
deal
of
research
in
biology
economics
and
more
recently
in
the
multi-agent
systems
domain
</s>
<s>
However
there
are
still
many
open
questions
</s>
<s>
In
this
paper
we
address
some
of
these
questions
by
investigating
the
effects
of
time-varying
non-symmetric
rewards
on
the
evolution
of
cooperation
in
the
spatial
Prisoner
s
dilemma
game
</s>
<s>
The
rationale
behind
this
approach
is
based
on
the
notion
that
the
associated
payoffs
from
pursuing
certain
strategies
do
vary
among
members
of
real-world
populations
</s>
<s>
In
our
model
agents
with
limited
cognitive
capacity
play
the
game
with
their
local
neighbours
</s>
<s>
In
addition
to
its
game
playing
strategy
each
agent
has
additional
attributes
that
can
be
used
to
control
the
number
of
rounds
of
the
game
the
agent
actually
participates
in
as
well
as
the
magnitude
of
any
rewards
that
it
receives
</s>
<s>
Numerical
simulations
show
that
dynamic
updates
to
payoff
values
induce
a
change
in
equilibrium
cooperation
levels
</s>
<s>
This
suggests
that
heterogeneous
payoff
values
and
social
diversity
within
a
cost-benefit
context
are
important
factors
in
the
promotion
of
cooperation
in
the
spatial
Prisoner
s
dilemma
game
.
