analys of evolv process of fog comput system bas on ba and er network hybrid model
fog comput is ory to the internet of thing which integr network comput stor and apply cap
it is a semi-virtualized distribut serv comput paradigm
it extend dat dat process and apply to the edg of the network and provid intellig serv for us nearby
the purpos of thi pap is to design a saf stabl and efficy fog comput model
on the bas of the structure of fog comput system the evolv process of fog comput nod is model bas on ba scale-fr network and er stochast network model
then the evolv process of network hybrid model is analys
fin the evolv model of fog comput system is solv and a network model with two network charact is obtain
expery show that the hybrid network model has the adv of two bas network .
