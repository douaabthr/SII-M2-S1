an adapt hybrid algorithm for soc network to choos group with independ memb
choos a commit with independ memb in soc network can be nam as a problem in group select and independ in the commit is consid as the main crit of thi select
independ is calc bas on the soc dist between group memb
although ther ar many solv to solv the problem of group select in soc network such as select of the target set or commun detect just on solv has been propos to choos commit memb bas on their independ as a meas of group perform
in thi pap a new adapt hybrid algorithm is propos to select the best commit memb to maxim the independ of the commit
thi algorithm is a combin of partic swarm optim algorithm with two loc search algorithm
the goal of thi work is to combin the expl and the exploit to improv the efficy of the propos algorithm and obtain the optim solv
addit to combin loc search algorithm with partic swarm optim an effect select mech is us to select a suit loc search algorithm to combin with partic swarm optim dur the search process
the result of expery sim ar comp with the well-known and success metah algorithm
thi comparison show that the propos method improv the group independ by at least 21% .
