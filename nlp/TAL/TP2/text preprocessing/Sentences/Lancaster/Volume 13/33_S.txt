solv the twit senty analys problem bas on a machin learning-based approach
twit senty analys tsa as part of a text class task has been wid attend by research in rec year
thi pap pres a machin learn approach to solv the tsa problem in three phas
in the second phas a suit valu for repres each feat in the vect spac model is determin through the weight combin of the valu obtain from four method i.e. term frequ and invers docu frequ sem simil senty scor us sentiwordnet and senty scor bas on the class of tweet
in thi man find the perc of contribut or weight of each method is defin as an optim problem and solv us a genet algorithm
also the weight valu obtain from four method ar combin bas on the einstein sum as an import t-conorm method
fin the perform of the propos method is test bas on the acc of support vect machin and multinom naïv bay class algorithm on four fam twit dataset nam the stanford test dataset sts-gold dataset obama-mccain deb dataset and strict obama-mccain deb dataset
the obtain result show the high supery of the propos method in comparison with the oth method .
