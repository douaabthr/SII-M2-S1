min high influ co-location pattern from inst with attribut
a spat co-location pattern describ coex of spat feat whos inst frequ appear togeth in geograph spac
num study hav been propos to discov interest co-location pattern from spat dat set but most of them on us the loc inform of inst
as a result they cannot adequ reflect the influ between inst
in thi pap we tak addit attribut of inst into account in the process of co-location pattern min and propos a new approach for discov the high influ co-location pattern
in our approach we consid the spat neighb rel and the simil of inst simult and util the inform entrop approach to meas the influ of any inst exert on it neighb and the influ of any feat in a co-location pattern
then an influ index for meas the interest of a co-location pattern is propos and we prov the influ index meas satisfy the downward clos property that can be us for prun the search spac and thu an efficy high influ co-location pattern min algorithm is design
at last extend expery ar conduc on synthet and real spat dat set
expery result rev the effect and efficy of our method .
