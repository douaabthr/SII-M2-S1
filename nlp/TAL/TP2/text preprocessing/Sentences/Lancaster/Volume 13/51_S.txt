mot plan for redund robot manip us a novel multi-group partic swarm optim
metah optim algorithm ar wid us in mot plan of redund robot manip
ex method may converg to a loc minim
in thi pap a new multi-group partic swarm optim algorithm psoel is propos to solv the mot plan of manip
psoel consist of on elit group and sev child group
the pop is init with a pre-selection mech in which the memb of the elit group ar init with the best-performing partic of the child group
in the process of it the elit group and the child group evolv sep
when the elit group fal into a loc optim or is infery to child group for a certain tim an interact mech is trig
in the interact mech som of the best partic select from the child group wil replac the bad partic of the elit group
with thes mech of pre-selection and interact psoel can jump out of the loc optim and reach the glob optim or glob suboptim
sim result show that the propos algorithm psoel is supery to the comp algorithm and converg toward the optim .
