an evalu of ear biomet system bas on enh jay algorithm and surf describ
rec the ear biomet has receiv much at for hum recognit due to it un shap and rich loc feat
howev extract discrimin feat from ear im is a cruc task in pres of illumin chang low contrast nois and pos vary
with the aim of neut the effect of thes fact thi pap propos an autom enh techn us meta-heuristic optim to enh the ear im
her we mod a rec and simpl yet meta-heuristic optim techn known as jay algorithm by introduc a mut op to enh the ear im in few it and the propos approach is nam as enh jay algorithm
then we employ a pose-invariant loc feat extract surf to extract loc feat
fin thek-nnclassifier has us to evalu the rat of correct id
extend expery ar conduc on four standard dataset and the perform evalu is carry out by qualit and quantit meas
expery result clear ind the propos enh approach is competit as comp to two class method he clah and two meta-heuristic algorithm pso and de-based im enh techn .
