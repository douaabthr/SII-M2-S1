a parallel class framework for protein fold recognit
protein terty structure which is determin by it amino acid sequ via the protein fold process hav ess rol in the funct of protein
protein fold recognit is on of the interest study in bioinform
in thi pap to address thi issu we propos a feat select fs method bas on map_reduce framework and vortex search algorithm vsa
fs is on of the most import step of pre-processing dat which aim to select a vary subset of relev feat
in unparallel mod and typ dat ov hundr of feat select and dimend reduc algorithm hav been provid such as principl compon analys linear discrimin analys and so on
nevertheless thes algorithm ar not impl for real-world apply when dat inst increas in three-dimensional volum veloc and vary that cal big dat act if we want to us prevy feat select method on big dat volum of larg and complex comput wil be requir
vsa was inspir from the vortex pattern cre by the vort flow of the stir fluid
in map_reduce framework map and reduc funct execut in parallel mod
in the propos method in each step of map funct a vsa is employ to find an optim subset of feat and decreas feat search spac
in the light of the abov consid we evalu the propos method in class of a benchmark dataset for protein fold recognit
the expery result ind that the propos method improv predict acc consid .
