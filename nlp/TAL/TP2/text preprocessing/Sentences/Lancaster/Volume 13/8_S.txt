a node-priority bas large-scal overlap commun detect us evolv multi-objective optim
commun structure is on of the most import feat in complex network
howev with increas of network scal som ex method cannot effect detect the commun structure of complex network and the avail method most aim at non-overlapping network
in thi pap we foc on overlap commun detect in large-scal network becaus most of the commun in real-world network ar overlap
in ord to improv the acc of large-scal overlap commun detect we suggest a commun detect method bas on nod pri
the propos algorithm has two adv 1 we defin a pri funct text f _ text nn to assess the clos between adjac nod
it expl the pot commun structure in adv and reduc the scal of network
2 we employ nsga-ii and select al pareto front to min large-scal overlap commun
the propos algorithm is test by the art and real dataset
the result show that the propos algorithm can effect improv the acc of commun detect and has bet optim effect .
