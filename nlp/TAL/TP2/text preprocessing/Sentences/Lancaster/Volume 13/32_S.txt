improv many object optim algorithm us object dimend reduc
many-objective optim problem maop hav rec receiv a consid at from research
due to the larg numb of object maop bring sery difficul to ex multi-objective evolv algorithm moea
the maj difficul includ the poor scal the high comput cost and the difficul in vis
a numb of many-objective evolv algorithm maoea has been propos to tackl maop but ex maoea hav stil fac with the difficul when the numb of object increas
real-world maop oft hav redund object that ar not on iness to describ the pareto-optimal front but also detery maoea
a common approach to the problem is to us object dimend reduc algorithm to elimin redund object
by remov redund object object reduc algorithm can improv the search efficy reduc comput cost and support for decid mak
the perform of an object dimend reduc strongly depend on nondomin solv gen by moeas/maoea
the impact of object reduc algorithm on moea and vic vers hav been wid investig
howev the impact of object reduc algorithm on maoea and vic vers hav been rar investig
thi pap study the interdepend of object reduc algorithm on maoea
expery result show that combin an object reduc algorithm with an moe can on success remov redund object when the tot numb of object is smal
in contrast combin the object reduc algorithm with an maoe can success remov redund object ev when the tot numb of object is larg
expery result also show that object reduc algorithm can sign improv the perform of maoea .
