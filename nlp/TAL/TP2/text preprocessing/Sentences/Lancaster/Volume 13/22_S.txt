min traff congest prop pattern bas on spatio-temporal co-location pattern
traff congest is a direct reflect of the imb between supply and demand for a certain period of tim
ow to the complex of traff road and the prop of congest the evacu of traff congest for loc road sect alon cannot achiev sign result
bas on the meas dat of traff flow thi pap combin the topolog of the road network and the ex tim of congest to judg the spatio-temporal correl of congest between road sect
we propos a spatio-temporal co-location congest pattern min method to discov the ord set of road with congest prop in urb traff and meas it influ in congest ev
the propos method not on rev the process of congest prop but also uncov the main prop path lead to the large-scal congest
fin we expery with the algorithm on the traff dataset in guiyang city
the expery result rev the traff congest rul in guiyang city includ the prev co-occurrence of congest prop pattern and their influ in congest ev .
