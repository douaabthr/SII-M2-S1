singl lay chebyshev neur network model with regression-based weight for solv nonlinear ordin diff equ
in thi investig a novel singl lay funct link neur network nam chebyshev art neur network chan model with regression-based weight has been develop to handl ordin diff equ
in chan the hid lay is remov by an art expand block of the input pattern by us chebyshev polynom
thu the techn is mor effect than the multilay an
init weight from the input lay to the output lay ar tak by a regression-based model
her feed-forward structure and back-propagation algorithm of the unsuperv vert hav been util to mak the er valu minim
num exampl and comparison with oth method exhibit the supery behavy of thi techn .
