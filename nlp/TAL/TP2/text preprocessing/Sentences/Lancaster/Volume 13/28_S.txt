predict of corn dry perform for a combin irc dry with a genetically-optimized svr algorithm
grain dry process is a complex nonlinear system which is charact by long delay process mult disturb and strong coupl
in ord to expl the model of an uncertain system such as thos us in grain dry and to study the apply of the support vect regress algorithm a corn dry process conduc in a side-heat infr rady and convect dry was model by us a support vect regress algorithm combin with a genet algorithm which is abbrevy as ga-svr
the algorithm was train by us the input and output dat collect from the pract expery of corn dry
the predict perform comparison between the ga-svr model method and the oth two model method the neur network of bp model and the svr model bas on the grid search algorithm wer also mad
moreov we success us the method to design a model of concurrent-counter flow dry
the design ga-svr model has achiev high model predict acc accord to the predict result which hav ver the feas of the propos model algorithm for model the grain dry
the model method can also real the perform predict of diff dry techn and can be apply in the model predict control of the grain dry .
