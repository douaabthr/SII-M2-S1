a polynom tim algorithm for big dat in a spec cas of minim constraint remov problem
the minim constraint remov mcr is on of the most import problem in mot plan and comput geometry
in thi problem ther is no feas path for a robot to mov from the start point toward the goal
theref in ord to find a collision-free path the minim constraint should be remov
themcrproblem is np-hard when constraint hav arbit shap or ar in shap of convex polygon
sint it is not poss to solv the problem by determin algorithm in an acceiv tim for the problem with big dat sci hav tri to solv it by approxim method
in thi pap we pres a determin not approxim algorithm that solv the problem in a polynom tim
the simpl we us her is about the typ of dat neith about the acc of the solv nor about the siz of dat set
in thi pap a spec cas of thi problem is pres in which al the constraint ar axis-aligned-unit squ and the obstac hav on loc effect
loc effect mean ther ar no two cel which hav the sam label set
we propos an algorithm for thi vary of the problem which can be us for big dat
the propos algorithm has o n 3 tim complex in the worst cas .
