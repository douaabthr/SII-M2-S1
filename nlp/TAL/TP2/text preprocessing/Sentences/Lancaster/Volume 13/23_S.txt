estim of spreading sequ in lc-ds-cdma sign bas on spars auto-encoder
a method bas on a spars auto-encoder sae network for the estim of spreading sequ in long-code direct-sequence code-division multipl access lc-ds-cdma sign is propos
first a network class model bas on sae and softmax class is est
next the effect of the propos method is ver by estim walsh sequ and m sequ
to estim the spreading sequ the lc-ds-cdma sign is divid into frag
then each us s spreading sequ is sep by the fast independ compon analys fast-ica algorithm and the amplitud fuzzy is elimin by the delay-and-multiply method
fin the spreading sequ ar estim by the sae model
expery result show that the propos algorithm could effect estim the spreading sequ of lc-ds-cdma sign
comp to the ex match algorithm and fast-ica algorithm the estim tim requir by the propos algorithm was short and it estim perform at low signal-to-noise ratio was supery .
