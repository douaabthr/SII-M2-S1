sens plac optim and dam id in a fusel structure us invers mod problem and firef algorithm
the structural monit of mech system is an extrem import task for ens it perform and structural heal
to overcom limit of tradit non-destructive inspect ndi dam id techn hav been develop from glob ind main thos bas on mod dat
in thi study dam ar ident by solv an invers problem
a fusel model of an e190 aircraft is consid and the firef algorithm fa metah is apply to solv the invers problem in ord to ident structural dam loc and sev
the method is then solv in two main front 1 the direct problem us finit el analys and 2 the invers problem by minim an object funct
evalu mod respons at many point on a large-scal structure can becom prohibit
for thi a method of optim sens is perform us the fish inform matrix fim
result ar comp consid the sens plac optim problem
it is not that optim sens contribut to an improv in the id of dam main for complex and large-scal structures
the propos optim dam id process us fim-fa has the pot to be extend to a wid rang of shm apply in complex structures
hent tradit ndi hav many shortcom due to the complex of large-scal structures as wel as modern design structures and may not be pract if the structure has restrict access
accord an enh dam id method is develop in ord to bet handl meas dat to find structural chang or dam in complex aerospac structures .
