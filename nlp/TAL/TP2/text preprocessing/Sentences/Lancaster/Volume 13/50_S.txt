step away from maxim of concav quadr in random lin search
random lin rl search rely on find a minim of a giv cost funct along random select lin in the funct domain
ont three point along each lin ar ident a quadr funct pass through thes point is determin and the minim of the funct is us whenev the funct is convex
thi pap propos a two-step approach for handl concav cas 1 start from a point with the smallest funct valu and then 2 step in the direct away from the maxim of the quadr funct
prom num result comp the improv rl method with oth simil evolv method ar pres .
