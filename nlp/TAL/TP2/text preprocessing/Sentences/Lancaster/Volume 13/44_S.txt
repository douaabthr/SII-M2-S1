a hybrid evs approach in clust search spac with ad-hoc partit for multi-robot search
thi pap examin the problem of multi-robot target search in an unknown environ
sint no inform is avail about the target so the search is simil to the expl problem
in thi pap a new method is propos to improv the efficy of expl
the object of the propos approach is to minim the expl tim by reduc the redund cov and comput overhead
for expl the conceiv of fronty is being us
the follow hypothes form in ord to improv the expl 1 introduc of an ad-hoc partit method to handl redund cov
2 reduc of the search spac by clust group the fronty cel to minim the comput overhead
3 introduc of method for robot next posit assign problem nam nearest frontier-clust cent method when a singl robot is search in the sub-region
a hybrid of egypt vult and sim an bas approach when mor than on robot ar search within a sub-region
perform of the propos approach is evalu through sim in two diff workspac with a team siz of 2 and 4 robot
four diff perform meas nam redund cov object loc tim expl tim and expl perc ar consid to evalu the perform of the propos method
result show that propos hybrid-evsa method complet expl much fast in both the workspac with the team siz of 2 and 4 robot as comp to oth stat of art approach due to low comput overhead and reduc redund cov .
