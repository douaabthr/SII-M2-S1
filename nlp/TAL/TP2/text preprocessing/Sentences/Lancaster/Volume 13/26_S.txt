an init method for the lat vect in prob matrix fact for spars dataset
recommendation-based e-commerc apply hav been util by many company to increas their sal perform
prob matrix fact pmf is a widely-used method for collab filt in recommend system
although the method s perform has been demonst success in many challeng dataset includ netflix they ar not abl to perform wel in larg spars dataset wher ther is consid low numb of rat inform
as a remedy num adv of pmf wer propos which incorp sid inform into lat vect as pri in ord to ens rich pri inform in them
howev in cas wher such sid inform is inaccess pmf-based algorithm do not perform wel
in thi study we propos two new init method for pmf which tak into consid the distribut stat of us produc rat to enrich lat vect
the expery show that the propos solv giv bet result to thos in the lit in very spars dataset .
