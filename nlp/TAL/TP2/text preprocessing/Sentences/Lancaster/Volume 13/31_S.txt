a spac transform crow search algorithm for optim problem
new and efficy meta-heuristic algorithm ar alway in demand to solv real world optim problem due to it exploit cap in the search domain to gen the glob optim solv
crow search algorithm csa is on of the latest meta-heuristic algorithm introduc in the lit to solv optim task
the clev behavio of crow attract the research to think how to achiev a bet optim by us crow as a bas el
lik oth optim algorithm the csa suff with loc optim and stagn problem
in addit for complex real world problem csa has not sufficy expl cap
theref in the cur work an attempt is mad to enh the expl behavio of the csa by combin the spac transform search sts method
the propos algorithm is nam as sts-csa
the propos sts-csaintegrates spac transform search techn and comput the solv in cur search spac and transform search spac simult to gen solv that is clos to glob optim solv
to assess the perform in solv optim problem sts-csa has been evalu by apply standard ie cec 2017 benchmark funct
three real-world engin problem ar also ver to assess the effect of the propos algorithm in solv the pract problem
the perform analys such as stat meas converg analys and complex meas rev that the propos method is rely and efficy in solv pract optim problem .
