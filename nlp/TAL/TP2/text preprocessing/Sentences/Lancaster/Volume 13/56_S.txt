an enh moth-flame optim algorithm for permutation-based problem
moth-flame optim mfo is on of the rec propos metah optim techn which has been success us in wid rang of apply
howev ther ar two issu with the mfo algorithm
first as a stochast techn mfo may prem converg at som loc minim dur the search process
second the origin mfo was develop for continu search spac problem and is not direct appl to e.g. permutation-based problem pbp
in thi pap a novel perturb strategy is introduc to the mfo algorithm to avoid prob loc minim reg
thi strategy work as follow if the best solv obtain so far doesn t improv for a giv numb of consecut it the cur pop of solv is perturb us som crossov mech as an attempt to expl new prom neighbo in the search spac
in addit smallest posit valu map techn is employ in ord for the propos term crossmfo comfo algorithm to be appl to pbp problem
it is not that despit thes mod the propos comfo has the sam tim complex ord as the origin mfo
extend sim expery ar conduc to comp the propos comfo to the mfo oth enh vert of mfo and som metah optim in solv the well-known travel salesm problem tsp
empir result show that the solv obtain us mfo ar improv by a fact of 24 47% on av for larg tsp inst hav mor than 100 city us comfo and can ev reach 38 58% us diff set
in addit comp to oth algorithm in the lit the propos algorithm provid on av bet solv
hent it can be consid a prom and efficy techn for thi typ of problem .
