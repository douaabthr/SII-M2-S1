triclust of gen express microarray dat us coars grain and dynam dem bas parallel genet approach
interpret of microarray dat is oft cruc in vary aspect of comput analys
doz of techn lik clust subspace-clustering ar oft apply to thes dataset to pluck-out sign result that provid solv to drug discovery diseas id lik pract healthc problem
clust techn ar us to group the gen exhibit simil behavy und particul condit
thi class method fail whil the group of gen is don accord to a subset of condit as it perform glob
biclust address success thi issu hav constraint for evalu of gen group on und a subset of the condit
howev on of the limit of the biclust techn is it is not cap to analys the longitudin expery which consid diff tim point for the analys of the gen express profil und a subset of condit
thi affair mot to adopt triclust on gen express microarray dat
triclust us find a set of gen of simil behavy und a subset of condit und certain tim point
in thi research artic two new framework bas on diff vert of parallel genet algorithm ar propos to detect sign triclust in gen express profil
in the first framework the propos algorithm is bas on coars grain parallel genet approach and in the second framework the propos algorithm is bas on the dynam dem parallel genet approach
both of them consid the expery condit and along with the tim point with an adv of parallel the process and reduc the comput tim
the propos framework ar test on a standard yeast cel cyc saccharomyc cerevisia dataset and on it diff synthet vert which ar wid us in the gen express analys
the perform analys is don with respect to the aspect lik the converg spee of both the algorithm for diff input siz and with respect to the comput tim
the stat analys is perform follow by the biolog relev of the sim result is est with their funct annot der from the gen ontolog and keg pathway analys graph
the perform of the propos framework demonst it effect with the oth state-of-the-art schemes
expery result rev that the propos architect ar efficy as they consum less comput tim due to their inh parallel behavy
fin the suggest architect ar consid as rely framework and can be pref ov the tradit genet approach to analys the gen express microarray dat from the triclust prospect .
