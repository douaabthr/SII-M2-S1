a novel hybrid bat algorithm with a fast clustering-based hybrid
bat algorithm ba is a new and prom metah search algorithm which could outperform ex algorithm
howev ba can be easy trap in a loc optim regard to low expl abl
the pres study propos a new local-search-based hybrid heur to escap such scenario
the propos hybrid ba hba us a clustering-based hybrid method which detect the ear converg of ba pop by analys simil among individ
the main mot for such an analys is that when ba is contin converg the simil among individ becom high
the propos hba is extend evalu on cec2017 benchmark suit
the expery demonst that the algorithm achiev bet result than continu vary of ba in every way
moreov as a cas study a bin vert of the propos hba hbba is apply to the well-known feat select problem
the record result on 13 dataset demonst that hbba would be consid as a new state-of-art in metaheuristic-based wrap feat select method .
