a neighb search bas cat swarm optim algorithm for clust problem
clust is an unsuperv techn that group the simil dat object into a singl subset us a dist funct
it is also us to find the optim set of clust in a giv dataset and each clust consist of homog dat object
in pres work an algorithm bas on cat swarm optim cso is adopt for find the optim set of clust cent for alloc the dat object
furth som improv ar also incorp in cso algorithm for improv clust perform
thes mod ar describ as an improv solv search equ to improv converg rat and an accel veloc equ for bal expl and exploit process of cso algorithm
moreov a neighborhood-bas search strategy is introduc to handl loc optim problem
the perform of propos algorithm is test on eight real-life dataset and comp with well-known clust algorithm
the sim result show that propos algorithm provid qual result in comparison to ex clust algorithm .
