a novel method for high-level synthes of datapath in digit filt us a moth-flame optim algorithm
high-level synthes hls is on of the most import process in digit vlsi circuit design
ow to complex and enorm of the design spac in hls problem employ meta-heuristic method and swarm intellig has been consid as a high fav opt when solv such problem
thi research work propos a moth-flame optim mfo algorithm-based method for hls of datapath in digit filt wher scheduling alloc and bind step wer perform simult
it was observ that the efficy of the propos method enjoy an improv efficy thank to the ment simult step whil being combin with the mfo algorithm
by comp the perform of the propos method with genet algorithm bas method and partic swarm optim bas method for hls of digit filt benchmark it can be infer that the propos method outperform the oth two method in hls of digit filt
thi is evid approv by a maxim improv observ in the rat of the delay the occupy are of the chip and the pow consum for 2.99% 6.58% and 6.48% respect
in addit to the ment improv anoth striking charact of the propos method is it fast runtim in reach a respons
thi could sign low the cost whil increas the design spee of circuit hav larg dimend
as wel an av 20% ris was also discern in the algorithm runtim comp to the oth two method .
