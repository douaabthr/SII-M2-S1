hybrid genet algorithm and a fuzzy log class for heart diseas diagnos
for the past two decad most of the peopl from develop country ar suff from heart diseas
diagnos thes diseas at ear stag help paty reduc the risk of dea and also in reduc the cost of tre
the object of adapt genet algorithm with fuzzy log agafl model is to predict heart diseas which wil help med practit in diagnos heart diseas at ear stag
the model consist of the rough set bas heart diseas feat select mod and the fuzzy rul bas class mod
the gen rul from fuzzy class ar optim by apply the adapt genet algorithm
first import feat which effect heart diseas ar select by rough set the
the second step predict the heart diseas us the hybrid agafl class
the expery is perform on the publ avail uc heart diseas dataset
thorough expery analys show that our approach has outperform cur ex method .
