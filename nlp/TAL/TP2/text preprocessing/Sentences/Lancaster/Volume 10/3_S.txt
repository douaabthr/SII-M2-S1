multilevel im thresholding us entrop of histogram and rec develop population-based metah algorithm
multilevel thresholding is on of the most broad us approach to im seg
howev the tradit techn of multilevel thresholding ar time-consuming espec when the numb of the threshold valu is high
thu population-based metah p-metaheuristic algorithm can be us to overcom thi limit
p-metaheuristic algorithm ar a typ of optim algorithm which improv a set of solv us an it process
for thi purpos im thresholding problem should be seen as an optim problem
thi pap propos multilevel im thresholding for im seg us sev rec pres p-metaheuristic algorithm includ whal optim algorithm grey wolf optim cuckoo optim algorithm biogeography-based optim teach learning-based optim gravit search algorithm imp competit algorithm and cuckoo search
kap s entrop is us as the object funct
to conduc a mor comprehend comparison the ment p-metaheuristic algorithm wer comp with fiv oth
sev expery wer conduc on 12 benchmark im to comp the algorithm regard object funct valu peak sign to nois ratio psnr feat simil index fsim structural simil index ssim and stabl
in addit friedm test and wilcoxon sign rank test wer carry out as the nonparamet stat method to comp p-metaheuristic algorithm
ev to cre a mor rely result anoth object funct was evalu bas on cross entrop .
