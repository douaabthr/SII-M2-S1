an on-line pittsburgh lcs for the three-cornered coevolv framework
the three-cornered coevolv framework describ a method that is cap of address class task through coevolv coadapt evolv wher three diff ag i. e
a gen ag and two class ag learn and adapt to the chang of the problem without hum involv
her art problem can be gen in concert with class ag in ord to provid insight into their rel
prevy work on the two-cornered coevolv framework provid found for impl the system that was abl to set-up the problem s difficul appropry whil trig the coevolv process
howev the trig process was set man without util the third ag as propos in the origin framework to perform thi task
prevy work on the three-cornered coevolv introduc the third ag a new class ag to trig the coevolv process within the system wher it funct and effect on the system requir investig
thi pap detail the impl for thi cas two class ag that us diff styl of learn techn e. g
superv vers reinforc learn techn is adapt in the class ag to learn the vary class problem
ultim learn class system lcs is chos to be impl in the particip ag
lcs has sev pot charact such as interpret gen cap and vary in repres that ar suit for the system
expery show that the pittsburgh-style lcs with the adapt of tabu search techn in s cap to autonom adjust the problem s difficul and gen a wid rang of problem for class
the adapt of a-plus to an on-line system is success impl
furth the class ag i. e
r and i ar abl to solv the class task wher the class perform ar vary
the three-cornered coevolv framework off a gre pot for autonom learn and provid us insight into coevolv learn ov the standard study of pattern recognit
the system is cap of autonom gen vary problem learn and provid insight into each learn system s abl by determin the problem domain wher they perform rel wel
thi is in contrast to hum hav to determin the problem domain .
