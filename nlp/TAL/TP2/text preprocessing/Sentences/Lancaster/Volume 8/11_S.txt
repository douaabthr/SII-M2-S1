a hybrid evolv algorithm for the symbol model of multiple-time-scal dynam system
nat and art dynam system in the real world oft hav dynam at multipl tim scal
such dynam can contribut subst to the complex of a dynam system and increas the difficul with which it can be analys
although evolv algorithm hav been propos that ar am to the autom model of dynam system non hav explicit tak into account multipl tim scal or lev the inform about thes dynam that is inh in expery observ
we propos a hybrid approach to the design of model for multiple-time-scal dynam system that combin an evolv algorithm with oth metah and conv nonlinear regress
with on minim human-supplied domain knowledg the algorithm autom the process of analys raw expery observ and cre an interpret symbol model of the system und study
we describ the algorithm in detail and demonst it appl to a vary of both phys and sim system
in addit we study the perform and scal of the algorithm und diff typ of dynam vary level of expery nois and oth fact relev to the pract apply of the algorithm .
