a sem network-based evolv algorithm for comput cre
we introduc a novel evolv algorithm ea with a sem network-based repres
for en thi we est new form of ea vary op crossov and mut that we adapt to work on sem network
the algorithm employ commonsens reason to ens al op preserv the mean of the network us conceptnet and wordnet knowledg bas
the algorithm can be interpret as a novel memet algorithm ma giv that 1 individ repres piec of inform that undergo evolv as in the origin sens of memet as it was introduc by dawkin and 2 thi is diff from ex ma wher the word memet has been us as a synonym for loc refin aft glob optim
for evalu the approach we introduc an analog similarity-based fit meas that is comput through structure map
thi setup en the open-ended gen of network analog to a giv bas network .
