a study on divers for clust geometry optim
divers is a key issu to consid when design evolv approach for difficult optim problem
in thi pap we address the develop of an effect hybrid algorithm for clust geometry optim
the propos approach combin a steady-state evolv algorithm and a straightforward loc method that us der inform to guid search into the nearest loc optim
the optim method incorp a mech to ens that the divers of the pop doe not drop below a pre-specified threshold
three altern dist meas to estim the dissimil between solv ar evalu
result show that divers is cruc to increas the effect of the hybrid evolv algorithm as it en it to discov al put glob optim for mors clust up to 80 atom
a comprehend analys is pres to gain insight about the most import strengths and weak of the propos approach
the study show why dist meas that consid structural inform for estim the dissimil between solv ar mor suit to thi problem than thos that tak into account fit valu
a detail expl for thi differenty is provid .
