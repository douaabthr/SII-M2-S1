multy coevolv genet fuzzy system to develop bid strategies in elect market comput econom to assess mech design
thi pap suggest a genet fuzzy system approach to develop bid strategies for ag in onlin auct environ
assess efficy bid strategies is a key to evalu auct model and ver if the und mech design achiev it intend goal
due to it relev in cur energy market worldwid we us day-ahead elect auct as an expery and apply inst of the approach develop in thi pap
success fuzzy bid strategies hav been develop by genet fuzzy system us coevolv algorithm
in thi pap we address a coevolv fuzzy system algorithm and pres rec result concern bid strategies behavy
coevolv approach develop by coevolv ag interact through their fuzzy bid strategies in a multy environ and allow real and transp repres of ag behavy in auction-based market
they also improv market repres and evalu mech
in particul we study how the coevolv fuzzy bid strategies perform against each oth dur hour elect energy auct
expery result show that coevolv ag may enh their profit at the cost of increas system hour pric paid by demand .
