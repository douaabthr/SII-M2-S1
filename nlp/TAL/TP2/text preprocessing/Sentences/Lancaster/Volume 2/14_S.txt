adapt ε-ranking on many-objective problem
thi work propos adapt ε-ranking to enh pareto bas select aim to develop effectivemany-objective evolv optim algorithm
ε-ranking fin grain rank of solv aft they hav been rank by pareto domin us a random sampl proc combin with ε-dominance to fav a good distribut of the sampl
in the propos method sampl solv keep their init rank and solv loc within the virt expand ε-dominance reg of the sampl solv ar demot to an infery rank
the paramet ε that determin the expand reg of domin of the sampl solv is adapt at each gen so that the numb of best-ranked solv is kept clos to a desir numb that is express as a fract of the pop siz
we enh nsga-ii with the propos method and analys it perform on mnk-landscapes show that the adapt method work effect and that comp to nsga-ii converg and divers of solv can be improv remark on mnk-landscapes with 3 m 10 object
also we comp the perform of adapt ε-ranking with two repres many-objective evolv algorithm on dtlz continu funct
result on dtlz funct with 3 m 10 object suggest that the three many-objective approach emphas diff area of object spac and could be us as compl strategies to produc a bet approxim of the pareto front .
