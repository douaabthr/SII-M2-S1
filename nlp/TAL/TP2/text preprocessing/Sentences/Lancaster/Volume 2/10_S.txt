sequ problem that test gen in learn class system
we pres an approach to build sequ decid mak problem which can test the gen cap of class system
the approach can be apply to any sequ problem defin ov a bin domain and it gen a new problem with bound sequ difficul and bound gen difficul
as an exampl we apply the approach to gen two problem with simpl sequ structure hug numb of stat mor than a mil and many gen
thes problem ar us to comp a class system with effect gen xcs and a learn without gen q-learning
the expery result confirm what was prevy found main us single-step problem also in sequ problem with hug stat spac xcs can gen effect by detect thos substruct that ar necess for optim sequ behavy .
