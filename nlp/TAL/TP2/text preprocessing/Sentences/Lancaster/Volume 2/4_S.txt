multi-objective evolv learn of granul memb funct paramet and rul of mamdan fuzzy system
in thi pap we propos a multi-objective evolv algorithm moe to gen mamdan fuzzy rule-based system with diff trade-offs between acc and complex by learn concur granul of the input and output partit memb funct mf paramet and rul
to thi aim we introduc the conceiv of virt and concret partit the form is defin by uniform partit each lingu vary with a fix maxim numb of fuzzy set the lat tak into account for each vary the numb of fuzzy set determin by the evolv process
rul bas and mf paramet ar defin on the virt partit and whenev a fit evalu is requir map to the concret partit by employ appropry map strategies
the impl of the moe rely on a chromosome compos of three part which cod the partit granul the virt rul bas and the memb funct paramet respect and on purposely-defined genet op
the moe has been test on three real-world regress problem achiev very prom result
in particul we highlight how start from random gen solv the moe is abl to determin diff granul for diff vary achiev good trade-offs between complex and acc .
