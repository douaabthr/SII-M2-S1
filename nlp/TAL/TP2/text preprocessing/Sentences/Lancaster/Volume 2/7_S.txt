evolv of vis control for obstac avoid in mobl robot
the purpos of thi work is to autom design vis algorithm for a mobl robot adapt to it cur vis context
in thi pap we address the particul task of obstac avoid us monocul vis
start from a set of primit compos of the diff techn found in the lit we propos a gen structure to repres the algorithm us standard resolv video sequ as an input and veloc command to control a wheel robot as an output
gramm rul ar then us to construct correct inst of algorithm that ar then evalu us diff protocol evalu of traject perform in a goal reach task or imit of a hand-guid traject
a genet program is apply to evolv pop of algorithm in ord to optim the perform of the control
the first result obtain in a sim environ show that the evolv produc algorithm that can be easy interpret and which ar clear adapt to the vis context
howev the result traject ar oft er and the gen capac ar poor
to improv the result we propos to us a two-phase evolv combin imit and goal reach evalu and to ad som constraint in the gramm rul to enforc a mor gen behavy
the result obtain in sim show that the evolv algorithm ar mor efficy and mor gen
fin we apply the imit bas evolv on real sequ and test the evolv algorithm on a real robot
though simpl by drop the goal reach constraint the result algorithm behav wel in a corrid cent task and show certain gen capac .
