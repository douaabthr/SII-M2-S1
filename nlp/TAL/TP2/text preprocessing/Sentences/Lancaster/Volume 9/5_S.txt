pop bas ant colony optim for reconstruct ecg sign
a pop bas ant colony optim algorithm paco for the reconstruct of electrocardiogram ecg sign is propos
spec the paco find a subset of nonzero posit of a spars wavelet domain ecg sign vect that is us for the reconstruct of the sign
a tim window is us by the propos paco for fix certain decid of the ant dur the run of the algorithm
the optim behavio of the paco is comp with vary algorithm from the lit for ecg sign reconstruct and with two random search heur
expery result ar pres for ecg sign from the mit-bit arrhythm databas
the influ of sev algorithm paramet and of a loc search proc is evalu
the result show that the propos paco algorithm reconstruct ecg sign with high acc .
