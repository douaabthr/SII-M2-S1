a new bat echolocation-based algorithm for singl object optim
bat son algorithm bsa as a swarm intellig approach util the conceiv of echoloc of bat to find prey
howev the algorithm is un to achiev good precid and fast converg rat to the optim solv
with thi in mind an adapt bat son algorithm is introduc with new paradigm of real bat echoloc behavio
the perform of the algorithm is valid through rig test with sev singl object optim benchmark test funct
the obtain result show that the propos scheme outperform the bsa in term of acc and converg spee and can be efficy employ to solv engin problem .
