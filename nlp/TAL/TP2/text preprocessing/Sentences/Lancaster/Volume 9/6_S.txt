reduc project angl for bin tomograph with partic aggreg
thi pap extend partic aggreg reconstruct techn part a reconstruct algorithm for bin tomograph bas on the mov of partic
part suppos that pixel valu ar partic and that partic diffus through the im stay togeth in reg of uniform pixel valu known as aggreg
in thi work a vary of thi algorithm is propos and a foc is plac on reduc the numb of project and wheth thi impact the reconstruct of im
the algorithm is test on three phantom of vary siz and numb of forward project and comp to filt back project a random search algorithm and to sart a standard algebra reconstruct method
it is shown that the propos algorithm outperform the af algorithm on smal numb of project
thi pot mak the algorithm attract in scenario wher collect less project dat ar inevit .
