spectr sens in cognit radio network us kernel recurs least squ
cognit radio cr environ help in solv the spectr scarc by predict the avail channel through the coop spectr sens
spectr sens is consid to be on of the prim task in cr environ and many research hav contribut for the sam
in thi pap a coop spectr sens css environ for the cr has been develop to determin the channel avail for the commun
her a predict model nam hybrid coop spectr sens hkrls has been propos for detect the channel avail
init a hybrid mixt model is develop by der the eig stat of the cr environ and the stat ar provid to the hkrls predict
the propos hkrls predict algorithm is an improv ov the kernel recurs least squ krls as the propos algorithm contain sev kernel funct for the predict
the propos hkrls model is impl by consid four diff channel for the sim and evalu bas on met such as prob of detect and prob of the fals alarm
the sim result of the propos hkrls scheme is comp with oth comp model and the result prov that the model achiev improv channel estim .
