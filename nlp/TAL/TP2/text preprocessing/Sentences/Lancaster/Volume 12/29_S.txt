short-term elect load forecast method bas on stack auto-encoding and gru neur network
with the rapid develop of smart grid to solv the pow enterpr requir in short-term load forecast thi pap propos a short-term elect load forecast method bas on stack auto-encoding and gru gat recur unit neur network
first the method input hist dat which contain pow load weath inform and holiday inform and us auto-encoding to compress the hist dat and then the multi-layer gru is us to construct the model to predict the pow load
the expery result show comp with tradit model the propos method can effect predict the dai vary of pow load and hav low predict er and high precid .
