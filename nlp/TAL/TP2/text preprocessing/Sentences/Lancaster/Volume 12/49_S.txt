optim fopid/pid control paramet tun for the avr system bas on sin cosine-algorithm
to enh the control perform an adv sin cosine-algorithm sca is employ for fract ord pid fopid control tun in thi pap
the sca-fopid control is bas on model-based control design method of phys system to get bet perform
the fopid control is design by sca optim techn us the tim domain object funct for avr system
the sca techn is respons to optim fiv paramet of fopid control bas on minim valu of object funct of the control design
the propos sca-fopid control is design at a glob optim of object funct is acheiv
then the avr system has good reg of termin volt at the output to meet desir perform
the propos method has a good ref track abl and frequ respons
thi method is comp with the pid and fopid control design of avr system in the rec year the propos sca-fopid control giv an excel perform from the extend sim study .
