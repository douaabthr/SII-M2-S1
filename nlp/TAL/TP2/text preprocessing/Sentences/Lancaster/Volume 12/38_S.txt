dm-limga dual migr loc island model genet algorithm a bet divers preserv island model
island model genet algorithm img is a multi-population bas ga
img aim to avoid loc optim by maintain pop island divers us migr
ther ar sev mech of migr and individ select such as the best or worst individ select new nat inspir evolv model and dynam migr policy
migr can delay island loc converg and intrins preserv divers
iron migr is also pot to bring overal island glob converg fast
in a certain gen the migr individ among island wil hav simil valu genet drift
so thi work aim to preserv glob divers bet by impl loc img limg and dual dynam migr policy ddmp
limg cre un evolv trend by us a diff kind of gas for each island
ddmp is a new migr policy which rul the individ migr
ddmp determin the stat of an island accord to it divers and attract level
by determin it stat ddmp ens the individ migr to the correct island dynam
we cal the combin of limg and ddmp as dual migr limg dm-limga
our expery show that dm-limga can preserv the divers bet
as it imply dm-limga can cre a mor extend search spac and domin the result among oth solv .
