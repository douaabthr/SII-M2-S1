ucrlf un constrain reinforc learn framework for phase-awar architect for autonom vehic sign and traject optim
sign and traject optim work as cont and research hav deb on what should be the best for the vehic but it seem that both compon ar compl to each oth and ther can be combin situ with bound wher maxim optim can be achiev
thi pap introduc a novel approach cal phase-awar deep learn and constrain reinforc learn for optim and const improv of sign and traject for autonom vehic op mod for an intersect
it deal with al the compon requir for the sign system to op commun and also navig the vehic with prop traject so that it fac less wait tim and the overal system op with minim wait tim and comp throughput rat
we hav don analys on the op tim and the vehic mov as thes ar vit for pollut and energy consum
our methodolog ar not on efficy in tim and comput but also hav incorp high optim dat repres to reduc the overhead of maintain and access the dat
thi ens very efficy tim complex and theoret comput tim and bet low bound
constrain reinforc learn conceiv is the main contribut of thi work and it help in decreas 84% of the wait tim for the vehic .
