a grad weight-based ant colony approach for solv the multiobject multidimend knapsack problem
the multiobject multidimend knapsack problem momkp is an extend of the multiobject knapsack problem that consist in select a subset of item in ord to maximizemobject funct
the momkp cre an addit difficul than the monodimend vert caus by the fact of respect mor than on constraint simult
in thi pap we propos to solv the momkp with an ant colony optim approach bas on a grad weight gen method nam gw-aco
her the weight vect ar grad distribut in the object spac and chang rel to the optim process
thi en ant to target at each cyc diff reg in ord to try to achiev almost al solv cov the pareto front
to evalu the suggest gw-aco approach a set of expery is perform on momkp benchmark inst and comp with well-known state-of-the-art metah approach
the obtain expery result show that gw-aco is sign bet and abl to achiev a wel distribut al ov the pareto-optimal front .
