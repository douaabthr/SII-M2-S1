a risk-driven multi-objective evolv approach for select softw requir
expl it and incr approach cur softw project defin vary delivery releas which ought to be develop within budget constraint but rais custom satisfact as much as poss
in search bas softw engin such a problem is refer to as next releas problem nrp in which the select of softw requir for the next releas is reform as an optim problem
mor rec nrp propos hav evolv to a multi-objective perspect provid non-dominated recommend that bal the trade-off surfac with respect to custom satisfact and develop cost
despit key adv in nrp propos most of them do not deal with softw risk which repres a vit aspect that can deeply impact on project cost and custom satisfact
in such a direct us multi-objective evolv algorithm moea thi pap propos and evalu a risk-driven system approach for the nrp problem in which a risk analys is incorp for estim the impact of softw risk in develop cost and custom satisfact
by contrast three diff well-known moea empir result bas on two semi-real dataset rev the pot efficy and pract appl bring not on mor real prec and mean estim but also find a sign perc of unanticip solv .
