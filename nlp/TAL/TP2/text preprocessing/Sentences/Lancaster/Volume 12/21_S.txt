multiobject environ adapt method for solv environmental/economic dispatch problem
environ adapt method is on of the evolv algorithm for solv singl object optim problem
although the algorithm converg very fast and produc divers solv ther ar three weak in it
in thi pap first we hav giv the solv to resolv thes weak and then we hav extend the mod method to deal with multipl conflict object simult
a permutation-based multiobject environ adapt method pmoeam has been suggest to solv the environmental/economic dispatch ee problem of the pow system
in thi pap tot gen cost and environ emit hav been tak as two object that nee to be minim simult whil meet the load demand und eq and ineq constraint
three test system ar consid to evalu the perform of the propos algorithm
the perform of the suggest algorithm is comp against fiv multiobject algorithm
extend expery result demonst that the pmoeam method can obtain effect and feas solv for ee problem .
