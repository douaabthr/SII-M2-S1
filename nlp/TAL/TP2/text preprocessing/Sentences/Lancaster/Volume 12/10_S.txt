a new evolv neur network bas on intrud detect system us locust swarm optim
the nee to avoid comput system breach is increas
many research hav adopt diff approach such as intrud detect system idss to handl vary threats
intrud detect has becom an imp system to detect vary sec breach
until today research fac the problem of build rely and effect idss that can handl num attack with chang pattern
thi pap deal with feed-forward neur network fnn train problem us the apply of a rec inv meta-heuristic optim algorithm locust swarm optim lso for the first tim
fnn is combin with lso fnn-lso to build an adv detect system and improv the perform of id
our method is apply to a sery of expery to study the cap and perform of the propos approach
expery study beg by us intrud detect evalu dat nam nsl-kdd and unsw-nb15 to benchmark the perform of the propos approach
the most common evolv train nam partic swarm optim pso-based train and genet algorithm ga-based train wer impl to ver the result
comp with ex method in the lit our propos approach provid to be mor acc to be an altern solv for id
the expery result show that our train algorithm not on attain a very good perform in term of spee converg but also achiev rely due to the reduc lik of being trap in loc minim
furtherm our propos model improv the detect rat .
