remov of rain video bas on temp intens and chromatic constraint of raindrop
an improv algorithm of fram tim diff is propos and apply to raindrop remov of video im . thi pap analys the temp intens waveform and chromatic constraint property of raindrop and the method is optim by thes two property
we mak us of the diff between rain and non-rain mov object in the pixel intens chang which real a broad class between the rain and non-rain mov object pixel
the candid raindrop pixel ar optim in combin with the chromatic constraint property
the expery result show that the propos algorithm has a bet effect of rainy day in video im rest than garg s and it is simpl and effect
the algorithm has a strong appl and it can be furth us for many apply such as air pollut control man outdo surveil remot sens and intellig vehic .
