a new genet optim tens produc funct link neur network an apply to the dai exchang rat forecast
the train spee for multilay neur network is slow due to the multilay
theref remov the hid lay provid that the input lay is endow with addit high ord unit is suggest to avoid such problem
tens produc funct link neur network tpflnn is a singl lay with high ord term that extend the network s structure by introduc suppl input to the network i.e. joint act
although the structure of the tpflnn is simpl it suff from weight combin explod problem when it ord becom excess high
furtherm simil to many neur network method select of prop weight is on of the most challeng issu in the tpflnn
find suit weight could help to reduc the numb of nee weight
theref in thi study the genet algorithm ga was us to find near-optimum weight for the tpflnn
the propos method is abbrevy as ga tpflnn
the ga tpflnn was us to forecast the dai exchang rat for the euro/us doll and japanes yen/us doll
sim result show that the ga tpflnn produc mor acc forecast as comp to the standard tpflnn ga ga tpflnn with backprop ga-functional expand flnn multilay perceptron support vect regress random forest for regress and naiv method
the ga help the tpflnn to find low complex network structure and/or near-optimum paramet which lead to thi bet result .
