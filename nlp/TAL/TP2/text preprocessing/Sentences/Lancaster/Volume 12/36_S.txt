cloud model bas sin cosin algorithm for solv optim problem
sin cosin algorithm sca is a rec develop optim techn which us sin funct and cosin funct as op to find the glob optim solv
howev prop paramet set is a challeng task
on us the numb of it to adjust the algorithm paramet cannot ful reflect the converg inform in the evolv process so sca lack the adapt in solv diff optim problem
to address thi issu a cloud model bas sin cosin algorithm csca is propos
in csca the cloud model is us to adjust the control paramet adapt whil keep sca algorithm framework unchang
the perform of the pres csca method is evalu us 13 benchmark test funct with diff dimend
expery result demonst that the propos algorithm is supery to oth sca vary in term of robust and scal .
