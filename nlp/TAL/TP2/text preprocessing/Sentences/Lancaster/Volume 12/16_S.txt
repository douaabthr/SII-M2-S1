emp penguin colony a new metah algorithm for optim
a metah is a high-level problem independ algorithm framework that provid a set of guidelin or strategies to develop heur optim algorithm
metah algorithm attempt to find the best solv out of al poss solv of an optim problem
a very act are of research is the design of nature-inspired metah
nat act as a sourc of conceiv mech and principl for design of art comput system to deal with complex comput problem
in thi pap a new metah algorithm inspir by the behavy of emp penguin which is cal emp penguin colony epc is propos
thi algorithm is control by the body heat rady of the penguin and their spiral-like mov in their colony
the propos algorithm is comp with eight develop metah algorithm
ten benchmark test funct ar apply to al algorithm
the result of the expery to find the optim result show that the propos algorithm is bet than oth metah algorithm .
