integer-pso a discret pso algorithm for task scheduling in cloud comput system
cloud comput is an emerg technolog that chang the comput world through it pow to serv the nee of any us who requir bet comput pow ov the internet
for thi environ the end us may want to hav a bet qual of serv at low cost and cloud serv provid hav a diff goal of achiev maxim profit and minim man overhead
task scheduling is a challeng task in thi scenario to meet the requir of both the end
thi work propos a discret vert of the partic swarm optim pso algorithm namelyinteger-pso for task scheduling in the cloud comput environ which can be us for optim a singl object funct and multipl object funct as wel
expery study on diff typ of task set charact norm traff and bursty traff in the cloud comput environ show that thi approach is bet hav good converg and load bal .
