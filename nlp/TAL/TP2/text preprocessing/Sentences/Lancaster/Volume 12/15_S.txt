cross domain assocy us transf subspac learn
transf learn has gain mor at rec by util knowledg acquir from on domain to adv a learn perform in anoth domain
ex homog transf learn method hav progress to a point wher feat spac ar common in train and test domain
howev heterog transf learn is stil in it nasc stag wher feat of train and test domain ar diff
tak thi into account bregm diverg regul is us to minim the prob distribut diff between train and test domain and to tak them togeth to a shar subspac
to discrimin dat within individ domain a project matrix is obtain us fish linear discrimin analys subspac learn algorithm
expery is perform on two efficy us biomet the fac and fingerprint
two typ of cross-domain set ar us 1 fac finger2fing wher train sampl com from fac label sampl and fingerprint unlabel sampl dat set whil test is perform on a fingerprint dataset
2 fing face2fac wher train sampl com from fingerprint label sampl and fac unlabel sampl dat set whil test is perform on a fac dataset
thi pap propos a cross domain assocy between fac and fingerprint that find util in forens apply .
