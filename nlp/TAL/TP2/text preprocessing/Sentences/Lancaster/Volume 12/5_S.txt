a mov damp wav algorithm for solv glob optim problem
thi pap pres a new optim methodolog cal mov damp wav algorithm for solv glob optim problem
the propos methodolog mim mathem the behavy of waveform induc by oscil phenomen
it start by cre multipl init random solv which ar upd through introduc a mathem model bas on a damp wav funct
in the propos methodolog the upd mech of solv ar bas on design a mathem rel for the mov wav with the aim to effect achiev robust solv
theref thi methodolog can be mor robust stat sound and converg quick to the optim glob solv
the perform of the propos is valid by carry out on 23 benchmark problem and three engin design problem
the result show vivid that the propos is a rely algorithm and outperform the comp algorithm in most cas .
