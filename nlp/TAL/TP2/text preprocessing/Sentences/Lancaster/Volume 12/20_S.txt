an aug anim migr optim algorithm us worst solv elimin approach in the backdrop of diff evolv
a new algorithm has been form bas on the bas anim migr optim amo algorithm
dur the cours of thi propos work it was rev for the first tim that amo algorithm is a tru replic of degl algorithm and when mathem analys was carry out the simil wer brought to not which was til dat not report
furth dur the investig it was also wit that amo algorithm in it virgin form is cap of del a competit perform when apply to optim of non-linear funct refer to cec 2014 test suit
such success achiev us bas amo algorithm inspir the pres auth to tak it as a challeng for expl the poss of improv the conv amo algorithm with an object of provid it with a new shap and build an efficy framework for tackl the handicap encount in origin amo algorithm
in fact the incess quest of mod the bas algorithm gav bir to a new algorithm known as aug anim migr optim algorithm in the backdrop of diff evolv aamo-de
the propos algorithm ev though incorp the philosoph of jay algorithm it cre a mem hierarchy of worst solv gen in each it
and unlik jay algorithm wher the posit upd equ employ the cur worst solv the propos on pick up a random worst solv from the arch to achiev bet divers and also drop the glob best term which oft yield bias solv
the propos aamo-de algorithm could accompl high enco result when cec 2014 test suit problem wer subject to valid check
the perform of the propos algorithm was tru impress in comparison with it counterpart compr of state-of-the-art algorithm
in cas of apply to real world engin problem the outcom wer very prom and real prov that the propos aamo-de algorithm is not on a strong contend in the optim commun exhibit excel result but is also a pot robust algorithm and has the abl to converg toward glob optim without being trap in loc minim as evid from test exampl .
