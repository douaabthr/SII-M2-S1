impl of self adapt mut fact and cross-over prob bas diff evolv algorithm for nod loc in wireless sens network
nod loc or posit is ess for many posit aw protocol in a wireless sens network
the class glob poison system us for nod loc is limit becaus of it high cost and it unavail in the indo environ
so sev loc algorithm hav been propos in the rec past to improv loc acc and to reduc impl cost
on of the popul approach of loc is to defin loc as a least squ loc lsl problem
dur optim of lsl problem the perform of the class gauss newton method is limit becaus it can be trap by loc minim
by contrast diff evolv de algorithm has high loc acc becaus it has an abl to determin glob optim solv to the lsl problem
howev the converg spee of the conv de algorithm is low as it us fix valu of mut fact and cross-over prob
thu in thi pap a self-adaptive mut fact cross-over prob bas diff evolv sa-mcde algorithm is propos for lsl problem to improv converg spee
the sa-mcde algorithm adapt adjust the mut fact and cross-over prob in each gen to bet expl and exploit the glob optim solv
thu improv loc acc with high converg spee is expect from the sa-mcde algorithm
the rig sim result conduc for sev loc algorithm decl that the propos sa-mcde bas loc has about 40 90 mor loc acc ov the class techn .
