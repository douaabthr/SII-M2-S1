an optim pid control for a bip robot walk on flat terrain us mciwo algorithm
the design of appropry control play an import rol in achiev the dynam bal gait of the bip robot
the pres pap deal with the tun of gain kp kdandk of the propos pid control us two non-traditional glob optim algorithm nam partic swarm optim pso and a vary of invas wee optim iwo cal mod chaot invas wee optim mciwo algorithm which is new propos by the auth
the effect of the new propos mciwo algorithm has been ver with the help of benchmark funct by conduc the norm test paramet and non-parametric test
furth the develop mciwo algorithm is us to develop the optim pid control for the bip robot
ont the pid control ar optim the perform of the control in term of vary perform meas of the bip robot ar comp
fin the gait gen us the optim pid control ar test on a real bip robot .
