hybrid decid tre for dat streams bas on incr flex naiv bay predict at leaf nod
min dat ov streams in on pass and us const mem is a challeng task
decid tre ar on of the most popul class for both batch and incr learn due to their high degr of interpret eas of construct and good acc
the most popul decid tre for stream class is hoeffd tre bas on hoeffd bound
lit show a few vary of decid tre bas on diff bound
the default class predict method adopt in decid tre is maj class approach
lat the acc of predict was scal up by a hybrid decid tre wher naiv bay class was us for predict
kernel dens estim kde is employ in flex naiv bay for class
howev it is suit for model stat dat set
thi pap propos an incr flex naiv bay ifnb bas hybrid decid tre paradigm that us kde to model continu attribut at leaf nod of the tre for improv the class predict acc
expery result on both synthet and real dataset show that the propos ifnb bas leaf class achiev improv ov the class predict method adopt in ex decid tre for dat streams .
