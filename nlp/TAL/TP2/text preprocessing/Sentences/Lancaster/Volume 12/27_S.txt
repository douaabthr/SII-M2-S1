a gas sourc loc algorithm bas on nls init optim of partic filt
a gas sourc loc algorithm bas on the init nls valu optim of partic filt pf-nls is propos to solv the problem that the posit acc of nls algorithm is reduc due to rough init valu estim and improp weight alloc of nod
first the stat spac model of the system is est by us the gas turb diffus model the partic weight is upd by construct the lik funct and then the init posit and init sourc strength of the gas sourc ar obtain by us the nls algorithm
fin the tru inform of the gas sourc is acc estim by us the pf-nls algorithm
the sim result show that comp with nls the algorithm has high posit acc furth improv the converg spee of the algorithm by optim the init valu and can be wel apply to pract scenario .
