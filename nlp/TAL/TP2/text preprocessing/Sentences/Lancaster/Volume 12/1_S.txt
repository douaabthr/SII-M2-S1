hybrid of firef algorithm and pattern search for solv optim problem
firef algorithm fa is a new introduc meta-heuristic nature-inspired stochast algorithm for solv vary typ of optim problem
fa tak inspir from nat phenomenon of light emit by firef and is on of the robust and easy impl algorithm
the standard fa consist of three stag nam init firef posit chang stag and termin stag
a maj drawback assocy with standard fa in it termin stag is it fail in get the most optim valu due to the fact that aft a fix numb of it no sign improv can be observ in the solv qual
in thi pap thi issu is resolv by introduc pattern search ps at the termin stag of standard fa when ther is no furth improv in the solv qual
the propos approach consist of three stag
in the first stag the paramet of standard fa ar init
in the firef chang posit stag the random fact is us to upd the solv in each it of op stag
in the fin stag the optim valu obtain from the fa dur it maxim numb of it ar giv as input to the pattern search algorithm
the pattern search is an optim algorithm that furth optim the valu obtain in the maxim it of standard fa
the propos techn has been nam as fa-ps in which ps has been us to introduc enh in the solv qual of standard fa
the develop approach has been apply to vary typ of maxim and minim funct and the perform has been comp with standard fa and genet algorithm in term of get the most optim valu for the funct being consid
a sign improv has been observ in the solv qual of fa .
