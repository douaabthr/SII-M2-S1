minim landmark for robot loc in orthogon environ
robot loc is on of the most funda problem in mot plan with many import apply in track vehic and rout system
on way for loc the robot is tril which is us in the environ without gps antenn by us a numb of sign that can be meas their dist to robot at any tim
it has already been shown that lfloor frac 8n 9 rfloor landmark ar sufficy for tril a simpl n-side
lat as a bet result it has been prov that lfloor frac 2n 3 rfloor landmark ar sufficy for thi purpos
in thi pap we discuss the problem for orthogon polygon and show that frac n 2 landmark suff for tril an orthogonaln-gon
thi theoret achiev is import for most evolv algorithm and neuro-computing techn which nee mor speedup and high efficy .
