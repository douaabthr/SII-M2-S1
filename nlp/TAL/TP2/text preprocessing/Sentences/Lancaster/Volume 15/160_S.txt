robot path optim in wareh man system
the integr of wareh man system with robot and evolv intellig evin technolog is cur in the foc as a way to optim wareh op and reduc assembl cost
thi study propos an evin-based solv toward wareh man system design
a neur network-based analys unit us in the system allow predict the optim numb of robot in the wareh
the propos approach was evalu by comp the perform of system with and without an analys unit and ant colony optim
in al cas the us of the neur network giv the sam amount of apply to be complet by few auxy robot in less tim and it result in reduc of the numb of collid dur the mov of robot
the emerg of thi structure improv navig efficy and allow reduc produc maint cost .
