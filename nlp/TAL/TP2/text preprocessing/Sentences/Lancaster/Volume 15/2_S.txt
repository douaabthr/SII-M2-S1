hybrid salp swarm algorithm with partic swarm optim algorithm for rec optim funct
the salp swarm algorithm ssa has shown it fast search spee in sev challeng problem
research show that not every nature-inspired approach is suit for al apply and funct
addit it doe not provid the best expl and exploit for each funct dur the search process
theref ther wer sev research attempt to improv the expl and exploit of the meta-heuristics by develop the new hybrid approach
thi inspir our cur research and theref we develop a new hybrid approach cal hybrid salp swarm algorithm with partic swarm optim for search the supery qual of optim solv of the standard and engin funct
the hybrid vary integr the adv of ssa and pso to elimin many disadv such as the trap in loc optim and the unb exploit
we hav us the veloc phas of the pso approach in salp swarm approach in ord to avoid the prem converg of the optim solv in the search spac escap from ign in loc minim and improv the exploit tend
the new approach has been ver on diff dimend of the giv funct
addit the propos techn has been comp with a wid rang of algorithm in ord to confirm it efficy in solv standard cec 2005 cec 2017 test suit and engin problem
the sim result show that the propos hybrid approach provid competit oft supery result as comp to oth ex algorithm in the research commun .
