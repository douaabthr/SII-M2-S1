dynam kidney pair exchang us mod multivers optim
kidney exchang is among the effect method that may perm supply an import platform for incompat donor-candidate pair to exchang org to achiev mut benefit and guar tre to peopl with kidney fail
howev build a dynam model for kidney pair exchang has becom an increas urg issu for aug the numb of avail kidney in the field of org transpl
ther has not been mad a lot of research on the kidney exchang problem in a dynam situ
mathem maxim the poss kidney exchang for a giv pool can be consid as an optim problem and has attract the at of the commun of research in the past few year
thu optim approach lik natural-inspired algorithm can help kidney pair exchang in defin which transpl should be mad among al incompat pair accord to som object
in thi pap a new nat stochastic-based algorithm cal a multivers optim is introduc to develop adv dynam approach for kidney pair exchang
the object of the propos approach is to maxim the numb of feas cyc and chain among the pool pair ov tim
the effect of the propos method is confirm by provid the best perform comp to the result of genet and antl algorithm which ar the on stochastic-based optim algorithm apply to the kidney exchang
furtherm we apply mor stochastic-based optim algorithm for kidney pair exchang to confirm the overal perform supery of our propos method
the perform of the propos method in a dynam situ demonst the competit of the propos method .
