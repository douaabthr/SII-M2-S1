multiobject memet algorithm bas on adapt loc search chain for vehic rout problem with tim window
thi pap pres a multiobject memet algorithm bas on adapt loc search chain mma-alsc for vehic rout problem with tim window vrptw which is an import research are in log
as shown in most prevy study vrptw is ess a multiobject optim problem and can be solv effect by the multiobject algorithm with vary loc search op
we hav observ howev that the prom solv obtain dur the process of evolv ar not ful util to guid the search togeth with diff loc search op
thi wil lead to the discontinu and insufficy search in the reg show prom
to allevy thi drawback mma-alsc is propos and charact by combin a multi-directional loc search strategy md-ls with an enh loc search chain techn els-chain
in mma-alsc on the on hand with md-ls diff loc search op ar design to perform the search toward multipl direct with distinct problem-specific knowledg of multiobject vrptw movrptw
on the oth hand with els-chain the prom solv obtain dur the process of evolv ar adapt select for the subsequ loc search op
in thi way mma-alsc can not on effect expl the search spac in multipl direct but also ful exploit the prom solv in a chain-based way
expery result on two suit of benchmark inst hav demonst the competit perform of mma-alsc when comp with oth repres algorithm .
