video super-resolution us hybrid support vect regress act crit neur network model
the aim of video super-resolution sr is to produc a high-resolution hr video fram from num success low-resolution lr fram
ev though ther ar a larg numb of techn employ for the video sr al thes ex techn fac a hect challeng at vary condit
thu thi pap propos an effect video resolv strategy us the hybrid support vect regress act crit neur network svr acn model for video enh
the sr im form us the individ svr model and acn ar integr us the weight av conceiv
the acn is tun optim by the propos fractional-based sin cosin algorithm f-sca which is respons for the glob optim converg
the expery of the propos method util three video tak from the cambridge-driving label video databas camvid and the result ar analys for three scal fact
the result prov that the propos model off a bet sr im with a bet psnr ssim and sdme of 33.6447 db 0.9398 and 45.2779 respect .
