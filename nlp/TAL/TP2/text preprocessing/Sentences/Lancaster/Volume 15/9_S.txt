two level approach bas on multifact optim to solv the clust shortest path tre problem
the clust shortest-path tre problem cluspt has a gre mean in theoret research as wel as a wid rang of apply in everyday lif espec in the field of network optim
being abl to solv the cluspt wil path the way for improv pract system such as agricult irrig and produc distribut
multifact evolv algorithm mfe is a vary of evolv algorithm ea aim at simult solv multipl fact task which can be divers in typ dimend and search spac
the apply of mfe hav yet to be ful exploit but the realm has rec attract much interest from the research commun espec thos who ar work on evolv multitask
consid thes charact thi pap describ a new approach us the mfe for solv the cluspt
the mfe has two task the first is solv the cluspt problem and the second is solv a new problem which is decompos from the cluspt problem
the goal of the first task is find the fittest solv as poss for the cluspt whil the goal of the second task is determin the best tre w.r. t
cost minim which envelop al vert of the problem
thi pap also introduc mut crossov and pop init op for a propos mfe to solv the cluspt
each of thes op deal with individ in two phas on of which ens that the result individ is a span tre and the oth phas ens that each of it clust sub-graphs is also a span tre
as the mfe had to deal with thes two task a decod method was also cre to allow commun between the task
to assess the effect of the propos algorithm and method the auth impl them on both euclid and non-euclide inst
expery result show that the propos mfe outperform the ex mfe algorithm on two-thirds inst with av improv valu of 47%
besid thi pap analys the converg trend of each task in gen and the affect of the numb of vert in the largest clust on the obtain result by us both the spearm s rank correl coefficy and scat graph .
