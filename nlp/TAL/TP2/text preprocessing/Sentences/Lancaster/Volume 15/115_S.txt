effect of the dist funct on the distance-based inst select for the feed-forward neur network
the distance-based inst select algorithm for the feed-forward neur network is a numeros reduc techn
it select on the inst at the decid bound between consecut class of dat to less the numb of inst in the origin train set us the euclid dist funct
thi pap study improv of the reduc perform and the class perform of the nin dist funct in the distance-based inst select algorithm
the evalu was conduc on the real-world dat set from the uc machin learn reposit and elen project
the dat reduc perform result confirm that the chebyshev cosin and minkowsk dist funct ar recommend for the integ dat typ
the minkowsk dist funct is recommend for the categ dat typ
the jaccard dist funct is recommend for the real dat typ
the select of the init dist funct bas on the dat typ can mak the distance-based inst select algorithm produc the best class perform .
