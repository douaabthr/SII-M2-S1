multi-view fus for recommend with at deep neur network
recommend system hav been wid develop and introduc in num apply
howev due to the lack of sufficy us feedback dat the recommend perform of such system is oft affect by dat spars
to address thi problem a multi-view fus recommend algorithm with an at deep neur network is propos
a two-stage joint learn solv is design in the propos model which combin us attribut item attribut and user-item interact inform into a un framework
the convolv neur network and at mech ar apply to improv effect of extract feat from us and item attribut
the extend deep neur network model bas on matrix fact and multiple-layer perceiv is us to enh the feat extract of us and item interact inform
expery result on the movielens-1 m and book-crossing real dataset show that the propos algorithm can achiev the best recommend acc comp with oth class recommend algorithm ev with extrem spars dat .
