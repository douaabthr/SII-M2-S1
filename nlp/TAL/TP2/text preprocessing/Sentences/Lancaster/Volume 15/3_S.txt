a mod teach learn metah algorithm with opposite-based learn for permut flow-shop scheduling problem
teaching-learning-based optim is on of the well-known metah algorithm in the research industry
rec vary population-based algorithm hav been develop for solv optim problem
in thi pap a random scal fact approach is propos to mod the simpl tlbo algorithm
mod teaching-learning-based optim with opposite-based-learning algorithm is apply to solv the permut flow-shop-scheduling problem with the purpos of minim the makesp
the obl approach is us to enh the qual of the init pop and converg spee
pfssp is us extend for solv scheduling problem which belong to the categ of np-hard optim problem
first mtlbo is develop to effect determin the pfssp us the largest ord valu rule-based random key so that individ job schedules ar convert into discret schedules
second new init pop ar gen in mtlbo us the nawaz ensc ham heur mech
fin the loc exploit abl is enh in the mtlbo us effect swap insert and invers structures
the perform of propos algorithm is valid us ten benchmark funct and the wilcoxon rank test
the comput result and comparison ind that the propos algorithm outperform ov fiv well-known dataset such as car reev hel taillard and vrf benchmark test funct comp to oth metah algorithm
thep-value ind the sign and supery of the propos algorithm ov oth metah algorithm .
