sub-classification of invas and non-invasive cant from magn independ histopatholog im us hybrid neur network
histopatholog play a cruc rol in help clin to man paty s heal effect
to improv diagnost acc from histopatholog thi study evalu the pot of the pre-trained deep-learning-based model on a larg dataset for discrimin among sub-classes of breast cant
a hybrid model is propos by combin the pre-trained model xceiv and vgg16 along with conv machin learn class to achiev highest acc in the class of breast cant without consid the magn fact of the histopatholog im
real-time dat aug is also apply to the dataset in ord to reduc the problem of overfit
the perform of develop hybrid model is comp for achiev the highest class acc with an optim run tim
it has been found that vgg16 acquir an acc precid recal f-score are und the receiv op charact auc av precid scor of 78.67% 0.76 0.75 0.75 0.86 0.60 with a run tim of 39.72 min when us in conjunct with log regress which is furth enh by the xceiv model to 82.45% 0.83 0.82 0.82 0.90 0.70 with a run tim of 36.57 min
the most optim perform of the xceiv model suggest that it can be util as an autom system for the ear diagnos of breast cant .
