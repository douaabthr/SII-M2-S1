optim scheduling of a micro-grid with multi-period island constraint us hybrid cfcs techn
thi pap propos an efficy techn for optim scheduling of micro-grids with multi-period island restrict
the propos method is joint impl of cuttl fish algorithm cfa and crow search algorithm csa is known cfcs method
her the cfa search behavy is mod by the csa upd posit
the propos cfcs system is util for optim scheduling of micro-grid and consid decreas the calc load
the main purpos of propos work is dimin the micro-grid op cost togeth with the dispatch-able unit op cost cost of pow transmit as main grid with inconveny cost recogn with consum
the cost of pow transmit from main phas can be posit or neg bas on the flow direct of transmit lin link the microcircuit to main phas
neg cost that repres an export of pow to main grid emerg as econom adv of micro-grid
cost of inconveny imply the penal of mod load program outsid the tim interv particul by the consum
const penal fact is util for priorit load with respect to op sensit insid the particul tim interv in which a supery valu of the penal fact imply a least flex load bas on tim interv op set
the valu of the penal fact is chos reason gre to unit gen cost and market pric
in propos techn the cfcs is us for est the correct program of the mg combin accord to load sid pow rang
the cfcs method object funct can be defin as system dat subject to eq and ineq limit
at that tim cfcs model is perform at matlab/simulink work platform and perform is estim to ex techn .
