papr reduc and spectr sens in mimo system with optim model
cognit radio is trend domain which provid strong solv for address spectr scarc issu
many cognit radio standard suff from high peak to av pow ratio papr which may distort transmit sign
thi pap propos a techn for spectr sens bas on optim en papr us hybrid gauss mixt model gmm
the eig stat energy and papr reduc block is adapt by hybrid mixt model for predict the avail of spectr
in ord to model network with papr the new design optim algorithm nam elephant-sunflower optim eso is adapt
the propos eso techn is combin of eleph herd optim and sunflow optim
the gmm is en us eig stat energy along with papr
the gmm is adjust with an optim algorithm nam whal elephant-herd optim
the papr is reduc by optim adjust the paramet us propos eso
the channel avail is evalu by provid energy eig stat and papr as input
the effect of propos eso is illust with maxim prob of detect of 1.00 minim papr of 7.534 and minim bit er rat of 0.000 respect .
