stochast nonparallel hyperpl support vect machin for bin class problem and no-free-lunch theorem
in thi pap the bin class problem is consid and it solv is propos as the form class model bas on genet algorithm ga and nonparallel hyperpl support vect machin nhsvm term as stochast nonparallel hyperpl support vect machin snhsvm
as ga prov viol the non-revisiting condit of the no-free-lunch theorem for optim nflo then snhsvm hav the nat property that nflo do not apply to it
al the expery ar perform in a scenario in which no-free-lunch theorem for machin learn nflm do not apply on al the comp machin
the hypothes is that in such a scenario som class can perform bet than oth
the expery ar perform on the real world uc dataset and the snhsvm is comp with the stat of art support vect bas class with perform meas as acc
snhsvm achiev the highest acc in 100% of the cas and the friedm test confirm the bet perform of snhsvm on al of the dataset us
thes result valid the hypothes empir whil apart from snhsvm the nflm flo up for the oth comp class .
