a three-stage pso-based methodolog for tun an optim pd-controller for robot arm manip
six degrees-of-freedom dof robot manip ar dynam coupl and high nonlinear multi-variable system
calc the optim joint angl from the op spac i. e
invers kinem and design the optim joint control paramet ar two import research top
thi pap propos a 3 stag partic swarm optim pso bas methodolog for solv the invers kinem and optim the control paramet
in the first stag a pso algorithm solv the invers kinem problem by minim a multi-objective cost funct in the op spac i. e
the er in the end-effector s pos and theref find the optim joint angl
in the second stag polynom funct gen the desir traject between the init and fin pos in the joint spac
fin a second pso algorithm tun six proportional-derivative pd control on for each joint to track the desir traject by minim anoth multi-objective cost funct in the joint spac
two cas study bas on six dof pum 560 valid the perform of the propos methodolog
sim result show that the propos 3 stag methodolog provid fast and acc result as the pso algorithm ar effect in solv the invers kinem problem and tun the optim pd paramet .
