an improv hybrid genet algorithm to construct bal bool funct with optim cryptograph property
bool funct ar us as nonlinear filt funct and combin funct in sev stream ciph
the sec of thes stream ciph larg depend upon cryptograph property of bool funct
find a bal bool funct with optim cryptograph property is an op research problem in the cryptograph commun
sint the numb ofn-variable bool funct is 2 2 n it is not comput feas to search the entir spac of such funct for cryptograph sign funct when n ge 6
in gen the construct of bool funct with optim or near optim cryptograph sign property is form as combin optim problem
in thi pap we apply the genet algorithm with the integr of a loc search proc cal hybrid ga hga search for the bool funct with high nonlinear and low autocorrel
the perform of the genet algorithm depend upon the tun paramet such as crossov mech mut prob select criter and the cho of fitness/cost funct
to achiev an optim trade-off among two cryptograph property the cho of the cost funct play an import rol for find an optim solv
so our main foc is to construct bal bool funct us hga with a new cost funct and comp it with ex cost funct
our expery result show that the hga is mor efficy than ga and the new cost funct is mor efficy than ex cost funct for reach the optim solv .
