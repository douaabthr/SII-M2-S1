a new improv salp swarm algorithm us logarithm spir mech enh with chao for glob optim
rec salp swarm algorithm ssa has emerg as a new population-based meta-heuristic techn in the are of optim
it is main inspir from the navig and for behavio of salp swarm
the af algorithm weak is stagn in loc optim and low converg rat
to overcom thes drawback we propos a new improv spir chaot salp swarm algorithm cal isc-ssa
comp with origin ssa isc-ssa includ logarithm spir mech incorp with chaot search method cap to enh furth it perform
the funct of isc-ssa algorithm is first test on 20 unimod multimod and composit mathem optim problem with ten diff chaot map to select the most appropry on for isc-ssa mod
then the algorithm is apply to solv sev engin optim problem
the comp expery result with competit metah algorithm rev that isc-ssa algorithm can gen the best solv .
