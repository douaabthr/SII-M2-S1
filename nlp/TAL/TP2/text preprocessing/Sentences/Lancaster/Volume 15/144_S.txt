a simpl detect and gen algorithm for simpl circuit in direct graph bas on depth-first travers
thi pap propos a new algorithm for detect and gen simpl circuit within a direct graph
bef gen al simpl circuit in a direct graph the algorithm first detect wheth ther is a simpl circuit in direct graph and the detect can divid the direct graph into triv graph or strongly connect compon
in the process of detect the ex of simpl circuit the algorithm rep reduc the numb of vert in vertex set along with edg prun
bas on depth-first travers we can get al simpl circuit of the direct graph
espec instead of process depth-first travers bas on al vert the algorithm start with a random vertex in a strongly connect compon to reduc the numb of depth-first travers and obtain al simpl circuit of thi strongly connect compon
the difficul of the algorithm is to detect and delet the rep circuit in the process of gen al simpl circuit which can reduc both the stor spac and tim complex
as a result the output of the algorithm doe not contain any rep circuit
the algorithm simpl the edg set of direct graph and gre reduc the numb of depth-first travers thereby reduc the comput complex and improv the comput efficy .
