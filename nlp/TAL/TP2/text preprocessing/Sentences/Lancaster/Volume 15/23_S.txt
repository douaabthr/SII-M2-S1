adv cent and distribut svm model ov diff iot level for edg lay intellig and control
in thi er internet-of-things iot deal with bil of edg dev pot connect to each oth
maxim apply built on thes edg dev gen a mass amount of onlin dat and also requir real-time comput and decid mak with low lat e.g. robot dron self-driving car smart iot electron wear dev
to suff the requir the fut gen intellig edg dev nee to be cap of comput complex machin learn algorithm on liv dat in real-time
consid diff lay of iot and distribut comput conceiv thi pap suggest three diff op model wher the ml algorithm wil be execut in a distribut man between the edg and cloud lay of iot so that the edg nod can tak a decid in real-time
the three model ar model 1 train and predict both wil be don loc by the edg model 2 train at the serv and decid mak at the edg nod and model 3 distribut train and distribut decid mak at the edg level with glob shar knowledg and sec
al three model hav been test us support vect machin us thirteen divers dataset to profil their perform in term of both train and inf tim
a comp study between the comput perform of the edg and cloud nod is also pres her
through the sim expery us the diff dataset it is observ that the edg nod inf tim is approxim ten tim fast than cloud tim for al test dataset for each propos model
at the sam tim the model 2 train tim is approxim nin tim fast than model 1 and elev tim fast than model 3 .
