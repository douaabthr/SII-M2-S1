dynam crow search algorithm bas on adapt paramet for large-scal glob optim
despit the good perform of crow search algorithm csa in deal with glob optim problem unfortun it is not the cas with respect to the converg perform
conv csa expl and exploit ar strongly depend on the prop set of aw prob ap and flight leng fl paramet
in each optim problem ap and fl paramet ar set in an ad hoc man and their valu do not chang ov the optim process
to thi dat ther is no analys approach to adjust their best valu
thi pres a maj drawback to apply csa in complex pract problem
hent the conv csa is us on for limit problem due to fact that csa with fix ap and fl is frequ trap into loc optim
in thi pres pap an enh vert of csa cal dynam crow search algorithm dcsa is propos to overcom the drawback of the conv csa
in the propos dcsa two mod of the bas algorithm ar mad
the first mod concern the continu adjust of the csa paramet lead to a dcsa wher ap wil be adjust linear ov optim process and fl wil be adjust accord to the gen pareto prob dens funct
thi dynam adjust wil provid mor glob search cap as wel as mor exploit of the pre-final solv
the second mod concern the improv of csa s swarm divers in the search process
thi wil lead to a high converg acc and fast converg rat
the effect of the propos algorithm is valid us a set of expery sery us 13 complex benchmark funct
expery result high prov the mod algorithm effect comp to the bas algorithm in term of converg rat glob search cap and fin solv
in addit a comparison with conv and rec simil algorithm rev that dcsa giv supery result in term of perform and efficy .
