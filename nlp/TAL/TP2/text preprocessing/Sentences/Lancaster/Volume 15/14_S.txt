the hybrid of aco ga and rvns algorithm for solv the time-dependent travel salesm problem
the time-dependent travel salesm problem is a class of combin optim problem
nat metah is a suit approach to solv the problem with larg siz in short comput tim
prevy sev metah hav been propos for solv the problem
thes algorithm might hav a strong search intens and their divers mech may not be sufficy
due to the random nat population-based algorithm improv on the chant of find a glob
in thi pap we propos a population-based algorithm that combin an ant colony algorithm aco genet algorithm ga and neighb desc with random neighb ord rvnd
in the algorithm the aco and ga ar us to expl the prom solv area that ar yet to refin whil the rvnd exploit them with the hop of improv a solv
theref our metah algorithm bal between expl and exploit
extend num expery and comparison with the state-of-the-art metah algorithm in the lit show that the propos algorithm reach bet solv in many cas .
