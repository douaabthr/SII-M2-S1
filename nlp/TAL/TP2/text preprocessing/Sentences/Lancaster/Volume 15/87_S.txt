analys on dual algorithm for optim clust head select in wireless sens network
clust is the approach which is util for aggreg the nod as a group cal clust which is us for reduc the rout overhead
thi is a funda approach to extend the lif expect of wireless sens network
howev the main challeng in wsn is the clust head select whil tak the energy stabl into account
optim within the wsn is the outstand concern to provid intellect for the extend period of network lifetim
sint clust is a topolog control method to decreas the process of sns it extend improv overal system scal and energy efficy
moreov the appropry select of ch play cruc rol for attain sustain wsn
thi pap propos the firef contribut with firef cyc random fcr for the select of clust head in wsn
the random cre solv in thi algorithm is found bas on three distribut funct lik uniform norm and gamm distribut
moreov the analys is mad on the second algorithm firef cyc grey wolf optim fcgwo by mod r 1 and r 2 random vect of grey wolf optim
in real the fcr and fgcgwo algorithm ar plan on select the optim clust head by cont main on minim of delay minim of the dist between nod and stabl of energy
the analys is perform and explain in term of al nod network lifetim and energy efficy und the three distribut .
