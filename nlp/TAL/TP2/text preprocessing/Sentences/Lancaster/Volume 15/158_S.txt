predict of rock mass rat us neur network with an improv rid optim algorithm
evalu of tbm perform is crit for the cho of tbm spec and tunnel design
in the past decad the hypothet schemes depend on the rock frag process and the expery model up to field surveil as wel as machin perform ar the two main method
tradit and conv approach for rock mass rat rmr predict us consid excess paramet and the acc ar far from act valu
a new rmr predict model bas on the optim neur network nn is design
to improv the predict acc thi pap propos a new self-adaptive rid optim algorithm sa-ro which apply optim log to train the nn by upd the weight as wav veloc vp transvers wav veloc vs vp/vs stat stat ory magnitud pol wav typ and met
fin the rmr predict analys of the adopt nn-sa-roa model is comp to the conv and tradit class with vary learn perc 50% 60% 70% and 80% for three dat set respect
subsequ the perform of the propos work is ver us oth approach bas on er analys
the predict mean absolv er mae and the mean absolv perc er map of sa-ro ar smal than conv and tradit schemes
the result show that the propos method can success predict the act rmr .
