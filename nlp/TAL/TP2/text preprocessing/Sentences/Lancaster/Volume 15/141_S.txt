neur multi-task collab filt
in recommend system the rat matrix is oft very spars
collab filt recommend algorithm cannot be apply to spars mat or us in cold start problem
although the us trust rel provid som us addit inform for recommend system the ex research has not incorp the rat matrix and trust rel wel
the trust rel itself also has the problem of dat spars
with a foc on the problem of spars and low acc in collab filt algorithm thi pap propos a gen framework cal neur multi-task collab filt nmcf which can simult predict the rat and trust rel
that is the rat of the sam us in e-commerc platform and the trust rel in soc network promot and compl each oth and help to improv the predict acc of both
the study result for three dataset of real-world show that our algorithm perform bet in recommend and the acc of the propos algorithm is sign improv comp with that of the comparison model .
