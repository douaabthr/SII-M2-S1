a survey of energy-aware clust head select techn in wireless sens network
rec wireless sens network wsns ar becom very fam as they ar inexpend and easy to maintain and man
the network contain a group of sens nod which ar cap of sens comput and transmit
energy efficy is on of the most import challeng problem in wsn
sens nod hav inadequ energy and instal in remot area
hent it is difficult to rest the battery in wsn
theref to maxim the network lifetim appropry clust techn and clust head ch select method should be impl
the main ide behind the clust techn is that it clust the sens nod and reduc the compos dat simult and then it broadcast the dat
in thi process ch select is an ess part
theref thi survey pap provid an overview of the clust techn for reduc energy consum by review sev ch select techn in wsn that provid high energy efficy
sev techn hav been employ for ch select bas on partit clust optim low-energy adapt clust hierarchy hierarch distribut and oth class method
fin an analys is don bas on the impl tool met employ acc and achiev of the consid ch select techn .
