nich comprehend learn gravit search algorithm for multimod optim problem
many nich algorithm hav been propos in rec tim to cat complex real-world problem hav sev global/loc optim
thes algorithm help in loc as many global/loc optim as poss
howev to expl the search spac along with loc and maintain a larg numb of glob solv is alway a challeng problem
hent we propos a new nich strategy nam nich comprehend learn gravit search algorithm in which the clgsa algorithm is us to solv complex problem hav multipl solv
the propos algorithm first efficy tri to expl the search spac without trap in loc optim s and second it loc al poss glob optim s
thi algorithm has an extern mem that enh it cap to find the maxim numb of optim s
the propos approach is test on the ie cec-2013 multimod optim benchmark problem li et al
in evolv comput and machin learn group rmit univers melbourn austral techn report 2013
the result of the propos scheme ar comp with fiv oth state-of-the-art method
in ord to show the efficy of clgsa algorithm ov real-life multimod optim problem it apply to non-linear and a mix vary problem thi is the react pow dispatch problem rpd
a standard benchmark ieee-57 bus system is consid to evalu the efficy of the clgsa
the evalu sim result show that clgsa algorithm success solv multimod problem and the rpd problem with sign acc .
