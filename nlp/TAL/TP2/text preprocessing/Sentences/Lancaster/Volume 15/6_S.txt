real-time apply of swarm and evolv algorithm for lin follow autom guid vehic a comprehend study
on of the most econom form of autom guid vehic agv is a vision-based lin follow
a lin follow us machin vis to extract the path shap from the capt im and follow it
among many method for path detect som study suggest us the real-time apply of meta-heuristic population-based algorithm for vis lin follow agv
gen swarm intellig and evolv algorithm ar not wel suit for real-time apply as they nee gen to evolv
for thi reason a comprehend study is pres to find the best solv to thi particul apply
art bee colony genet algorithm harmony search imp competit algorithm and partic swarm optim wer study with three propos object funct that could assist path shap detect
the fastest and most rely solv is optim and test on a real agv platform
the agv design for thi research has an independ onboard raspberry pi 3 with an arm process and it is cap of travers the track fast and rely
furtherm the propos system doe not requir edg detect or down-sampling on capt im
addit our new develop direct infer techn the triangl closest midpoint en the agv to find it path ev with faul or incomplet input
as a result a novel real-time meta-heuristic lin follow agv is pres in thi research .
