an improv optim algorithm for collid detect of hybrid hierarch bound box
collid detect is cur a hot issu in virt real and oth field
the efficy and acc of collid detect direct affect the real-time upd effect of the virt real environ and it is also an import ind that affect the us s interact expery
in a complex virt real scen if the tradit collid detect algorithm sphere-obb is adopt and the tre structure travers is us to real the bound box travers detect the acc remain unchang but the detect complex is reduc
if the rapid collid detect algorithm is us the sep ax test method and the two-layer hybrid hierarch surround tre structure ar us although the amount of calc is larg the detect efficy is improv
us the sep ax sat algorithm and us the sep ax theorem to determin the vect ax can sav a lot of calc tim
the purpos of thi research is to propos an improv hybrid-level bound box collid detect optim algorithm aso bas on the tradit hybrid-level bound box collid detect algorithm
first bas on the spatio-temporal correl the the hybrid hierarch bound box hierarch tre structure is improv to aab and ob from top to bottom
the synchron desc rul is us to real the travers of nod and then the triangl are weight method is us to improv the calc method of the bottom ob bound box nod cent solv the bound box vertex cov matrix and improv the efficy and acc of collid detect
the expery result show that the algorithm propos in thi pap is 35.6% fast than the rapid detect spee and 29.9% fast than the sep ax sat detect spee und the sam acc
in the multi-object collid detect comp with the latest research the algorithm in thi pap short the intersect detect tim improv the collid detect efficy and meet the real-time upd requir of complex virt real scen .
