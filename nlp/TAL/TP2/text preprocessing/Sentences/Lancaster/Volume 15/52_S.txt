imp competit algorithm-based deep believ network for food recognit and cal estim
the vuln of the heal issu hav result in the altern to man the situ which ens the bet in lif
the diet assess stand as an effect solv for most of the heal vuln and the autom assess takes-off the man proc of assess the food intak
thi pap introduc an autom method of diet assess by propos the imp competit algorithm ipc bas deep believ network ipca-dbn for food categ recognit and the cal estim of the food
init the food im is pre-processed and subject to the seg process which is don by the bayes fuzzy clust
then the feat such as shap col histogram wavelet scat transform feat ar gen from the optim seg
fin thes feat ar fed to the ipca-dbn for recogn the food categ and estim the cal of the food
the expery perform us the unimib2016 dataset en the effect analys of the propos method in term of the met such as macro av acc maa standard acc sa and mean squ er mse
the analys prov that the propos method outperform the ex method and attain 0.9643 for maa 0.9877 for sa and 1816.9 for mse .
