a cloud model bas symbiot org search algorithm for dg alloc in rad distribut network
rec metah algorithm hav becom popul in solv dg plac problem due to it adv of simpl impl and abl to find the near optim solv for complex and large-scal optim problem
symbiot org search sos is on of the latest metah algorithm introduc to solv dg plac problem
unlik many oth metah algorithm sos is simpl to impl and doe not us any control paramet which lead to enh perform stabl
howev lik oth optim algorithm sos suff with loc optim and stagn which affect it acc and converg espec in solv real world problem lik dg plac problem
thi work attempt to enh perform of sos by combin with cloud-bas model
the propos algorithm is nam cloud bas model symbiot org search cmsos
in cmsos cloud-bas the hav been us to gen random numb op in mut phas of the origin sos
to assess the perform of cmsos in solv optim problem 26 benchmark funct with diff dimend hav been us
the perform of the propos algorithm has been test for real world dg plac problem
the perform analys such as stat converg and complex meas show supery of the propos algorithm comp to the study algorithm .
