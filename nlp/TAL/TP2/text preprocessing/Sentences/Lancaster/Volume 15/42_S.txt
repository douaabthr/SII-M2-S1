edit
thank you for giv me thi opportun to act as the guest edit of thi spec issu which is on nature-inspired algorithm for high-performance comput in comput vis
to tackl complex real-world problem sci hav been look into nat process and cre both as model and metaph for year
optim is at the heart of many nat process includ darwin evolv soc group behavy and for strategies
ov the last few decad ther has been remark grow in the field of nature-inspired search and optim algorithm
nature-inspired algorithm provid a system introduc to al maj nature-inspired optim algorithm for optim
cur thes techn ar apply to a vary of problem rang from sci research to industry and commerc
the two main famy of algorithm that prim constitut thi field today ar the evolv comput method and the swarm intellig algorithm
although both famy of algorithm ar gen ded to solv search and optim problem they ar certain not equ and each has it own distinct feat
reinforc each oth s perform mak pow hybrid algorithm cap of solv many intract search and optim problem
many problem in sci and engin can be form as optim problem subject to complex nonlinear constraint
the solv to high nonlinear problem us requir soph optim algorithm and tradit algorithm may struggle to deal with such problem .
