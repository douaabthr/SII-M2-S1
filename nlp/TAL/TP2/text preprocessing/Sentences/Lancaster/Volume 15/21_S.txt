a novel approach to build acc and divers decid tre forest
decid tre is on of the best express class in dat min
a decid tre is popul due to it simpl and straightforward vis cap for al typ of dataset
decid tre forest is an ensembl of decid tre
the predict acc of the decid tre forest is mor than a decid tre algorithm
const effort ar going on to cre acc and divers tre in the decid tre forest
in thi pap we propos tang weight decid tre forest twdforest which is mor acc and divers than random forest
the strength of thi techn is that it us a mor acc and uniform tang weight funct to cre a weight decid tre forest
it also improv perform by tak opin from prevy tre to best fit the success tre and avoid the toggl of the root nod
due to thi novel approach the decid tre from the forest ar mor acc and divers as comp to oth decid forest algorithm
expery of thi novel method ar perform on 15 wel known publ avail uc machin learn reposit dataset of vary siz
the result of the twdforest method demonst that the entir forest and decid tre produc in twdforest hav high predict acc of 1 7% mor than ex method
twdforest also cre mor divers tre than oth forest algorithm .
