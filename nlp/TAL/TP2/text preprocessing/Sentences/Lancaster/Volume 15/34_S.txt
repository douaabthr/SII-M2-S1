a comp approach to multiobject optim of aisc thin-walled memb
optim of structural memb such as beam and column has receiv increas interest with adv in comput manufact and art intellig
design pursu multiobject optim ar typ interest in minim the cost of the memb whil maxim som perform met rel to load bear cap or stress
in thi study thin-walled memb list in aisc tabl wer optim in a simil man us genet algorithm
the influ of sev object was consid and emphas was plac on provid the custom with a divers cho of solv
to demonst the approach wide-flang i-beams and circul pip cross-section wer examin
multi-dimensional pareto-fronts wer obtain
optim cross-section wer comp to aisc beam tabl
multi-criteria decision-making techn wer us to select a prefer solv from a pareto-front
for i-beams improv of 3 7% ov tabl wer obtain and for pip it was 47 76%
fin the perform of two common us genet algorithm nsga-ii and spea-ii was comp us pareto-front met
whil spea-ii produc sev nondomin solv nsga-ii was shown to produc the overal supery front consid met pres from the lit .
