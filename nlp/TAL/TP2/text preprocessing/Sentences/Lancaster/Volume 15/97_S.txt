bal broad and deep search in evolv comput via a parallel zon search
comput tim and solv precid ar two maj concern in evolv comput ec
although high-performance comput techn hav been apply to reduc the comput tim of meta-heuristic algorithm it doe not mean that they can assist meta-heuristic algorithm in find a high-quality solv
moreov most of meta-heuristic algorithm may belong to the depth-first search method thu achiev a tradeoff between the broad search and the deep search is a cruc object in the ec
to allevy the abov problem a parallel zon search pzs strategy is propos in the cur study
in the pzs the entir search spac is divid into many smal search spac for improv the broad search cap of algorithm and reduc the problem complex
subsequ select meta-heuristic algorithm consid as deep search algorithm ar employ to find a satisfact solv in each search reg
the effect of the pzs integr into six diff evolv de vary is demonst on two common us test suit i.e. ie cec2014 and bbob2012
result suggest that the pzs is a high competit approach to solv diff typ of optim problem espec on complex optim problem
fin the pzs incorp into six de vary is us to estim paramet of a heavy oil therm crack model
result ind that the pzs is an effect and efficy tool to help select algorithm solv act indust optim problem .
