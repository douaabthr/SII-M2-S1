fuzzy dragon deep believ neur network for act recognit us hierarch skeleton feat
in comput vis hum act recognit is an act research are for diff context such as hum comput interact healthc milit apply and sec surveil
act recognit is perform to recogn the goal and act of on or mor peopl from a sequ of observ bas on the act and the environ condit
stil ther ar numb of challeng and issu which mot the develop of new act recognit method to enh the acc und mor real condit
thi pap propos an error-based fuzzy dragon deep believ network error-based ddbn which is the integr of fuzzy with ddbn class to recogn the hum act from a complex and divers scenario for which the keyfram ar gen bas on the bhattachary coefficy from the set of fram of the giv video
the key fram from the bhattachary ar extract us the scal inv feat transform col histogram of the spatio-temporal interest domin point and hierarch skeleton
fin the feat ar fed to the class wher the class is don us the propos error-based fuzzy ddbn to recogn the person
the expery is perform us two dataset nam kth and weizman for analys the perform of the propos class
the expery result rev that the propos class perform the act recognit in a bet way by obtain the maxim acc of 1 a sensit of 0.99 and the spec of 0.991 .
