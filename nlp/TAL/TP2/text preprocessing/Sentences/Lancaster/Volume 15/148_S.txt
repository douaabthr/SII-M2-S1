gas outburst predict model us rough set and support vect machin
thi pap is concern with the problem of gas outburst predict in coal min work fac
to predict the gas outburst acc thi pap us the rough set the rs and support vect machin svm to est the predict model
first bas on the analys of influ fact of gas outburst 10 fact includ coal thick vary geolog structures and gas chang ar select as the influ fact
by us the attribut reduc algorithm to elimin redund inform the gas outburst influ fact as input to the predict model ar reduc from 10 to 6 in decid tabl
second by apply the partic swarm optim pso algorithm to optim penal paramet and kernel funct of svm and improv the gen perform of model the nonlinear rel between main influ fact and intens of gas outburst is est
fin 60 set of dat of jiul coal min in hen ar us as train and test sampl to ver the propos predict model and the discrimin result is comp with that of rbf model and svm model
the result show that the predict acc of the propos model is 93% which is improv comp with the oth two model
the rs-psosvm model can reduc dat redund avoid the model to fal into the loc extrem and can predict the risk level of gas outburst effect .
