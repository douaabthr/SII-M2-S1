paramet extract of sol cel us intellig grey wolf optim
the foc of pow produc has shift from conv energy sourc to sustain energy sourc becaus of the deplet of fossil fuel and carbon emit caus glob warm and clim chang
sol cel ar the most promin opt to deal with thes problem
the prec estim of sol cel paramet is very much requir bef their instal to achiev high efficy
in rec year apply of sev optim algorithm for paramet estim of the sol cel hav been address
rec intellig grey wolf optim igwo which is an adv vert of grey wolf optim gwo incorp a sinusoid trunt funct as a bridg mech and opposit bas learn has been introduc
the wid appl of thi vary has been examin ov diff conv benchmark funct and on som real problem
thi fact mot auth to employ thi vary on paramet extract process
the main mot behind the impl of igwo on sol cel paramet estim process is the efficy of thi vert to deal with complex optim problem
to estim the pv cel paramet valu meas of volt and cur ar consid at three import point
thes ar op circuit point short circuit point and maxim pow point for two sol cel repres model i. e
singl diod model and doubl diod model
result of igwo ar comp with the result of oth vary of gwo on thes two model and for three film mono crystallin poly crystallin and thin film
result rev that igwo produc bet result .
