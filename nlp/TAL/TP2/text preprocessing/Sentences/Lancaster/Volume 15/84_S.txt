optim bas rout model for the dynam path plan of emerg vehic
with the increas numb of traff vehic and urb the frequ of traff accid ar grow expon
the research for rout emerg vehic has gain sign at in vehicul ad hoc network vanet topolog
the path plan for an emerg vehic can avoid congest and minim the travel tim to prev accid
thu thi work propos a dynam path plan scheme for rout emerg vehic
at first the vanet is sim and the dynam path plan is perform aft the ar of emerg vehic
the propos dynam path plan includ two step nam travel-time forecast and bi-model rout
the travel tim is predict us the support vect regress model and the bimod is employ to rout the emerg vehic optim
the bimod consist of two step such as k-path discovery and optim path select process
init the poss k shortest path is detect from which the optim path is select by the propos expon bird swarm optim algorithm exp-bsa
the propos exp-bsa algorithm is design by integr the expon weight mov av conceiv in bird swarm algorithm bsa
thu the propos exp-bsa determin the optim path bas on the dev fit funct and the select path ar suggest to emerg vehic for fast rout
the perform of the propos dynam path plan for an emerg vehic bas on exp-bsa is evalu us three sim setup bas on the met such as dist av traff dens av spee and travel tim
also the perform of the propos method is comp with the ex method such as sfla-kc k-path and bsa
from the result it is expos that the propos exp-bsa method achiev the overal best perform than the ex method with a minim dist of 48.404 m an av traff dens of 0.015 min an av spee of 1.392 m/s travel tim of 19.608 s.
