optim perform of handl machin in timb worksit
with an intend grow of innov technolog impl nowaday the main problem is to evalu the respect of the us technolog and increas the produc of load and transport op of the timb industry
thi work aim to analys the technolog and econom fact affect the produc and cost of op of modern load machin us at enterpr in russ
comp analys is perform between the front load of sennebog liebher volvo fuch with artic ste highlift load and full-circle timb mat handl machin
the result of the analys of the load phys charact show that at increas the machin weight by 1.5 tim op cost increas correspond by about 1.5 tim whil output capac doubl
stal load rat for front load depend on the posit of the bar and the arm span and the optim condit of efficy funct and cost structure for thes typ of load machin ar est
the obtain result can be us for fut sci research and apply in indust enterpr as technolog recommend .
