grey wolf assist sift for improv cop mov im forgery detect
copy-move forgery is a gen widespread typ of digit im forgery wher a seg of an im is attach into a new port of the simil im to hid or reply the part which ar cal forg im
the forg im appear origin as the object reg in spit of being forg has attain the funda qual of the simil im itself
the cap of the copy-move forgery detect cmfd techn is lack due to som post-processing funct lik jpeg compress scal or rot etc
theref thi pap intend to develop a cmfd us scale-invariant feat transform sift best-fin-first algorithm bbf and random sampl consens ransac direct by grey wolf optim gwo algorithm
init the keypoint ar select us sift principl and bbf algorithm ident the match keypoint us keypoint threshold
furth sift feat describ is determin and the fin extract pair keypoint ar giv to ransac algorithm to remov al the mismatch keypoint
in thi cmfd model the paramet such as paramet keypoint threshold maxim dist of in in ransac and dist threshold in sift feat ar optim us gwo
the foremost purpos of thi research work is maxim the numb of pair keypoint
hent the propos model is term as gwo-based paramet optim for cmfd gwpo-cmd
the propos model is comp ov sev oth meta-heuristic-based keypoint threshold select and prov it efficy through divers analys .
