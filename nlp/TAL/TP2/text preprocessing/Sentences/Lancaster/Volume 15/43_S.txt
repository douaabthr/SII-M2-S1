a hybrid optim model for resourc alloc in ofdm-based cognit radio system
cognit radio cr system has been consid as the key technolog for the mobl comput and wireless commun in fut
howev the main challeng of the cr system is the alloc of resourc with minim transmit pow at an enh rat of transmit
thi pap propos the hybrid method which is the combin of grey wolf optim gwo and group search optim gso to alloc the resourc in the cr system in an optim man
it sim the gwogs-based cr system rely on the orthogon frequ divid multiplex ofdm to alloc the recours optim
aft attain the respect sim it comp the perform of the gwog to the conv algorithm lik genet algorithm ga partic swarm optim pso art bee colony abc firef ff gso gwo and soap
moreov it provid the valu comp analys in term of converg rank cost and impact of orthogon
in addit it rev the stat analys of the entir benchmark algorithm to attain the optim result
thu the expery result affirm the challeng perform of the propos method against the conv algorithm .
