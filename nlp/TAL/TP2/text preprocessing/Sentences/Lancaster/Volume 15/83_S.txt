bayes fus strategy for mov target detect in multichannel sar framework
target detect is on of the import subfield in the research of synthet apert rad sar
it fac many challeng due to the stat object lead to the pres of a scat sign
many research hav been don on target detect and most of them pref filt bas techn
in thi work the mov target detect in sar us decid fus method is propos
the new develop scheme is nam bayes fus for mov target detect bf-mtd as the scheme util the bayes model for ident the target loc
init the receiv sign from the sar ar fed through the short-time foury transform stft and the match filt for ident the target loc
then the result ar fus togeth by the bayes fus strategy for find the act target
for the fus the naiv bay class is us for determin the optim paramet for the target detect
the sim of the propos bf-mtd model is evalu by vary target it puls repetit level and antenn turn veloc of the sar
sim result rev that the propos bf-mtd has achiev sign perform for a detect tim miss target rat and mean squ er respect .
