autom handwrit charact recognit of devanagar langu a hybrid train algorithm for neur network
in the field of im process and art intellig the charact recognit and handwrit recognit hav been emerg as on of the act and challeng research area
in rec year ther has been a not develop in the research assocy with charact recognit in handwrit devanagar docu
to improv the recognit perform thi pap tact to develop new handwrit charact recognit model us an improv machin learn approach
the propos charact recognit model includ four stag lik pre-processing seg feat extract and class
init the scan handwrit docu for devanagar langu is subject to pre-processing which includ stag lik rgb to gray thresholding compl of im morpholog op linear and nois remov us med filt
then the charact of the pre-processed im ar seg us k-means clust that is a popul method for clust analys
furth the feat lik kirsch direct edg freem chain cod and neighb dist weight us delaunay triang ar extract from the seg charact
subsequ the class of charact is don us neur network nn wher the new train algorithm is us in which the weight ar optim us a hybrid optim by combin lion optim algorithm and grey wolf optim gwo
her the upd proc of gwo is bas on la algorithm and hent the propos algorithm is nam as lion upd gwo lu-gwo
to the next of the impl a valu comp analys confirm the improv perform of the propos lu-gwo-nn model ov conv method in class the conson num and vowel from diff charact .
