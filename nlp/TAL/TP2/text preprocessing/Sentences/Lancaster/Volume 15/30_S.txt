a hybrid approach to energy efficy clust and rout in wireless sens network
wireless sens network ar develop as a vit tool for monit divers real tim apply such as environ monit fact heal car wid are surveil and many mor
though the adv of wsns ar plenty the pres challeng is to gain effect control ov the deplet battery pow and the network lifetim
rec research hav prov that the energy consum can be minim if effect clust mech ar incorp
thi pap propos hock and heck novel energy efficy clust algorithm to increas the network lifetim for homog and heterog environ respect
both thes algorithm ar built us kril herd and cuckoo search
whil the optim clust centroid posit ar comput us the kril herd algorithm and the cuckoo search is apply to select the optim clust head
the perform of the hock algorithm is evalu by vary bas stat loc and nod dens
to evalu the heck algorithm two and three level heterog ar consid
the sim result show that the propos protocol is mor effect in improv the network lifetim of wsns comp to oth ex method such as gaech hybrid hsapso and eso-leach .
