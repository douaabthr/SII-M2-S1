cuddl dea algorithm us abc for detect unhealthy nod in wireless sens network
wireless sens network consist of som sens nod that hav a minim op cap with less mem capac for stor dat and limit energy sourc
the deploy of thes nod or sens tak plac random in a dynam or stat environ
thi typ of plac of nod in a hostil environ can be charg by the malicy nod in a wireless sens network wsn
thi vuln in nod mak the wireless sens network unst and lead to many typ of demerit lik limit battery lifetim less comput and limit mem spac
to avoid thes attack and to reduc the impact cre by the malicy nod we suggest a simpl and effect way of detect and remov unhealthy nod in the environ
we propos a simpl scheme by us the art bee colony algorithm which is known as the cuddl dea design
the them of a scheme is to find the unhealthy or malicy clust head nod in the network and remov that particul nod without cre any harm to the oth nod in the environ
it also help to improv the energy efficy packet delivery ratio with maxim throughput in wsn .
