a new diff evolv algorithm for coop fuzzy rul min apply to anoma detect
fuzzy class rul min can be consid as a challeng optim problem with the purpos of extract acc and interpret rul
thi pap deal with a michig coop approach for min fuzzy rul
the propos algorithm nam ede-frminer us an enh diff evolv that evolv pop of individ each on repres a singl rul
the whol pop collab to gen in on shot an acc and reduc numb of rul
ede-frminer is an intellig process of evolv that us fast arithmet op and a new coop weight mem
thi lat allow shar inform between individ
in addit it us a new threshold bas fit funct us a redefin support and confid meas
the adapt threshold mech us in the fit funct aim to adapt the min system to problem with dynam train dat
expery ar carry out us the nsl-kdd 99 intrud detect dat set and oth dat set from the uc reposit
a comp study with oth competit evolv rul bas system is perform and the result show the effect of propos algorithm .
