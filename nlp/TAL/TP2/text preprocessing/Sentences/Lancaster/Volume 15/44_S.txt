support vect regress and extend nearest neighb for video object retriev
video retriev is on of the emerg area in video capt that gain vary techn adv increas the avail of a hug mass of video
for the text or the im query giv retriev the relev video and the object from the video is not alway an easy task
a hybrid model was develop in the prevy work us the nearest search algorithm nsa and expon weight mov av ewm for the video object retriev
in nsa ewm the object traject ar retriev bas on the query spec dist
thi work extend the prevy work by develop a novel path eq scheme for eq the path leng of the query and the track object
init a hybrid model bas on support vect regress and nsa track the posit of the object in the video
the propos dens meas scheme eq the path leng of the query and the object
then the ident path leng rel to the query is giv to extend nearest neighb class for retriev the video
from the sim result it is evid that the propos video retriev scheme achiev high valu of 0.901 0.860 0.849 and 0.922 for precid recal f-measure and multipl object track precid respect .
