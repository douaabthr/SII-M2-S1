vin copula-based ed for dynam multiobject optim
dynam multiobject problem cov a set of real-world problem that hav many conflict object
thes problem ar challeng and wel known by the dynam nat of their object funct constraint funct and problem paramet which oft chang ov tim
in fact deal with thes problem has not been investig in detail us the estim of distribut algorithm eda
thu we propos in thi pap an eda-based on vin copula algorithm to deal with dynam multiobject problem dmop
vin copula ar graph model that repres mult depend us biv copula
the propos copula-based estim of distribut algorithm label dynam vine-copula estim of distribut algorithm dynvc-eda is us to impl two search strategies
the first strategy is an algorithm that us the model as a mem to sav the stat of the best solv obtain dur the cur gen
the second strategy is a prediction-based algorithm that us the hist of the best solv to predict a new pop when a chang occ
the propos algorithm ar test us a set of benchmark provid with cec2015 and the gee-tan-abbass
stat find show that the dynvc-eda is competit to the state-of-the-art method in deal with dynam multiobject optim .
