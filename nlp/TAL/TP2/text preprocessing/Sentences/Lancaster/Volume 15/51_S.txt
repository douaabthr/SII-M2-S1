glowworm swarm bas fuzzy class with dual feat for speech emot recognit
nowaday a gre at is focus on the study of the emot cont in speech sign sint the speech sign is on of the quickest and nat tact to commun among hum and thu many system hav been suggest to recogn the emot cont of a spok ut
thi pap schemes two contribut gend recognit and emot recognit
in the first contribut ther has two phas feat extract and class
the pitch feat is extract and giv for class us k-nearest neighb class
in the second contribut feat lik non-negative matrix fact and pitch ar extract and giv as the input to adapt fuzzy class to recogn the respect emot
in addit the limit of memb funct ar optim chos us a renown optim algorithm nam glowworm swarm optim gso
thu the propos adapt fuzzy class us gso is term as gso-fc
the perform of propos model is comp to oth conv algorithm lik grey wolf optim firef partic swarm optim art bee colony and genet algorithm in correspond with vary perform meas lik acc sensit spec precid fals posit rat fals neg rat neg predict valu fals discovery rat f1score and mathew correl coefficy .
