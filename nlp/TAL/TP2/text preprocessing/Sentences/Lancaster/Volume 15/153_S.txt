design of distribut temperature-measuring system bas on 1 wir bus for ultra-kilometre froz deep wel
the temp field of art freez curtain is a transy temp field chang with tim
in ord to ens the saf of the project improv the tim and acc of temp meas and ens the saf strength and effect wat seal of the curtain it is necess to impl the inform temp monit control for the freez process
accord to the apply environ of the freez monit for the long dist and mult meas point in the construct of the coal min ov a kilomet a monit system of the froz deep wel which is develop by the 1 wir bus technolog is propos
by us high-performance singl chip microcomput design pull-up and level detect driv circuit match cabl charact imp and distribut digit temp meas cabl the 1 wir bus network monit point can reach 55 and the transmit dist is ov 1000 m which meet the cur monit requir of froz deep wel .
