stochast grady desc linear collab discrimin regress class bas fac recognit
fac recognit is an import research top in biomet auth to provid a sec access to a comput system
due to intr and int person vary fac express and ag vary ar maj concern in fac recognit system
in ord to address thi concern a new discrimin algorithm is propos in thi research artic
a grady desc with moment and styl transf funct ar includ in linear collab discrimin regress class algorithm to charact the dissimil contribut of the train fac im and to learn the optim project matrix by maxim the ratio of the within class reconstruct er and collab between class reconstruct er
hent the propos collab algorithm not on enh the recognit acc and also overal comput efficy
in the expery phas the perform of the propos stochast grady desc linear collab discrimin regress class algorithm is valid on orl yal and extend yal b dataset becaus thes databas compr of the extend vary of fac detail express and degr of scal
the expery outcom show that the propos algorithm achiev maxim of 93.34% 90.07% and 98.83% of recognit acc on orl yal and extend yal b dataset respect
comp to the oth ex model the propos algorithm approxim show 1.5% to 10.5% improv in fac recognit in term of recognit acc on orl yal and extend yal b dataset .
