a new metah algorithm bas on wat wav optim for dat clust
dat clust is an import act in the field of dat analys
it can be describ as unsuperv learn for group the simil object into clust
the simil between object is comput through dist meas
furth clust has prov it sign for solv wid rang of real-world optim problem
thi work pres wat wav optim wwo bas metah algorithm for clust task
it is seen that wwo algorithm is an effect algorithm for solv constrain and unconstrain optim problem
but sometim wwo cannot obtain prom solv for complex optim problem due to abs of glob best inform compon and converg on prem solv
to address the absent of glob best inform and prem converg som improv ar inculc in wwo algorithm to mak it mor prom and efficy
thes improv ar describ in term of mod search mech and decay op
the absent of glob best inform compon is handl through upd search mech
whil the prem converg is address through a decay op
the perform of wwo algorithm is evalu us thirteen benchmark clust dataset us acc and f-score paramet
the sim result ar comp with sev stat of art ex clust algorithm and it is observ propos wwo clust algorithm achiev a high acc and f-score rat with most of clust dataset as comp to ex clust algorithm
it is also show that the propos wwo algorithm improv the acc and f-score rat an av of 4% and 7% respect as comp to ex clust algorithm
furth stat test is also conduc to valid the ex of propos wwo algorithm and stat result confirm the ex of wwo algorithm in clust field .
