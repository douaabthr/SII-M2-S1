toward robot vis us deep neur network in evolv robot
in evolv robot robot control ar oft evolv in sim as us the phys robot for fit evalu can tak a prohibit long tim
sim provid a quick way to evalu control fit
a sim is task with provid appropry sens inform to the control
if the robot has an on-board camer an entir virt vis environ is nee to sim the camer s sign
in the past thes vis environ hav been construct by hand requir the us of hand-craft model text and light which is a tedy and time-consuming process
thi pap propos a deep neur network-based architect for sim vis environ
the neur network ar train exclud from im capt from the robot cre a 3 dimend vis environ without us hand-craft model text or light
it doe not rely on any extern domain spec dataset as al train dat is capt in the phys environ
robot control wer evolv in sim to discern between object with diff colo and shap and they success complet the sam task in the real world .
