vary select for gen part linear model with longitudin dat
vary select and paramet estim ar of gre sign in al regress analys
a vary of approach hav been propos to tackl thi problem
among thos the penalty-based shrinkage approach has been most popul for the abl to carry out the vary select and paramet estim simult
howev not much work is avail on the vary select for the gen part model gplms with longitudin dat
in thi pap we propos a vary select proc for gplms with longitudin dat
the inf is bas on the scad-penaliz quadr inf funct which is obtain aft the b-spline approxim to non-parametric funct in the model
the propos approach efficy util the within-cluster correl inform which can improv estim efficy
the propos approach also has the virtu of low comput cost
with the tun paramet chos by bic the correct model is ident with prob tend to 1
the result estim of the paramet compon is asymptot to a norm distribut and that of the non-parametric funct achiev the optim converg rat
the perform of the propos method is evalu through extend sim study
a real dat analys show that the propos approach success in exclud the insign vary .
