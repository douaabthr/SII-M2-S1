a novel edg boost approach for im super-resolution
im super-resolution is high demand are in both research as wel as industry
in thi pap a novel deep network to acquir the high-resolution im from the input low-resolution im has been propos
the propos a novel residual-edge mod is us to build the network for singl im sup resolv
the residual-edge mod compr of tradit resid learn follow by the propos edg boost mech
the propos edg boost mech prop diff between the resid feat map across the network with dens connect
the propos edg boost mech enh the edg cont in the feat map learn by the resid block
thi study us condit gen advers network framework to optim the weight paramet
expery hav been carry out on benchmark databas to valid the propos network for im super-resolution
empir result show that the propos network perform bet oth ex method for im super-resolution .
