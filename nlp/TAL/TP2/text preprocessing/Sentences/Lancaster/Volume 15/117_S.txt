optimum-path forest stacking-based ensembl for intrud detect
machin learn techn hav been extend research in the last year main due to their effect when deal with recognit or class apply
typ on can comprehend us a machin learn system to autonom deleg routin sav hum effort and produc gre insight regard decision-making task
thi pap introduc and valid a stacking-based ensembl approach us optimum-path forest class in intrud detect task
instead of on us the fam nsl-kdd dataset we propos a new dataset cal unespy which we believ wil fil the gap concern new intrud detect dataset
both dataset wer evalu und sev class includ log regress decid tre support vect machin optimum-path forest and comp against optimum-path forest stacking-based ensembl
expery result show an optimum-path forest stacking-based ensembl class suit particul when consid it abl to gen larg volum of dat whil sustain it perform .
