holoentrop bas correl naiv bay class and mapreduc model for class the big dat
big dat is the rec immin technolog which can provid larg benefit to the busy admin
ow to such hug volum it becom very comply to ens effect analys by the ex techn
the comply can be rel to analys capt shar stor and vis of the dat
to tackl thes challeng a novel class techn us holoentrop bas correl naiv bay class and mapreduc model hcnb-mrm is propos
the propos hcnb which is design by combin the holoentrop funct with the correl bas naiv bay class deal with both high-dimensional dat set as wel as extend dataset to improv the benchmark and class the dat bas on depend assum
theref the propos hcnb-mrm is us to mak the process simpl and to choos the best feat from big dataset
the propos hcnb with the mapreduc model maxim the perform of big dat class us prob index tabl and postery prob of the test dat sampl
the perform of the propos hcnb-mrm is evalu us three met such as acc sensit and spec
from the expery result it is analys that the propos hcnb-mrm obtain a high class acc of 93.5965% and 94.3369% for the loc dataset and skin dataset when comp with the ex techn .
