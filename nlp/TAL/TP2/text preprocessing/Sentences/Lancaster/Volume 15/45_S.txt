fract weight bas object funct to a hybrid optim algorithm for model transform
model transform mt contribut a maj rol in the model-driven engin mde which ar us to transf the model among vary langu to refact and sim the model or to obtain the us cod from the model
thu the nee for mt in mde is very import but the pract method ar not suit for the detect of er in transform
thi pap propos an adv algorithm cal fract whal optim integr adapt dragonf f-woadf algorithm to perform the mt from the class diagram cld to rel schema rs model
the propos algorithm mod the adapt dragonf adf algorithm with the conceiv of whal optim algorithm woa us the fract the
the uml cld is transform into the rs model us the optim block that ar select with the us of the propos algorithm
the perform of the f-woadf method is evalu us autom correct ac and fit meas
the propos method produc the maxim ac of 0.8583 and the maxim fit meas of 0.8984 that ind the effect of the propos method .
