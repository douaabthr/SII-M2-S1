a novel disrupt bas symbiot org search to solv econom dispatch
econom dispatch ed is on of the vit prospect in the energy man system for determin the optim pow gen distribut among sev commit pow gen unit
the object of ed is to gen the elect pow to meet the load demand by minim the tot op cost subject to vary eq and ineq constraint
thi ed problem is gen solv us conv techn such as a grady method by assum the object funct as linear and convex
howev in gen the ed problem is constrain non-convex larg scal multimod and high nonlinear optim problem
in ord to overcom thi drawback vary heur techn hav been introduc in the lit
symbiot org search sos is on of the emerg nature-inspired meta-heuristic algorithm
due to simpl in impl and fre from algorithm-specific control paramet the sos algorithm has gain a reput among the research
the sos techn mim the biolog interact between two distinct specy to surv and prol in the ecosystem
to evad the suboptim solv and to enh the expl and exploit of the sos algorithm the disrupt op is integr with the bas sos to form a novel disrupt bas sos dso algorithm
the disrupt strategy is origin from astrophys and has the abl to shift between expl and exploit dur the process of find an optim solv
to illust the effect of the propos method it is apply on vary test system such as 3 unit 5 unit 6 unit 13 unit 20 unit 38 unit and 110 unit system to solv diff ed problem nam without transmit loss tl with transmit loss by simult consid valv point load vpl effect along with tl by simult consid the effect of ramp rat limit rrls prohibit op zon poz and tls and dynam econom load dispatch by consid rrls poz vpl and tl
the comparison of dso bas sim result with oth method rev the efficy and robust of the propos method to provid minim tot gen cost in al the cas with bet converg rat and less comput tim .
