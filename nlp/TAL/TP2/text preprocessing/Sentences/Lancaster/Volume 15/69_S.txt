sparse-fcm and deep learn for effect class of land are in multi-spectral satellit im
remot sens play a maj rol in crop class land us class and land cov class such that the inform for the class is ass with the help of the satellit im
thi pap cont on the land us class and propos an optim algorithm cal firef harmony search fhs for train the deep believ neur network dbn
the fhs algorithm is the integr of the firef algorithm and harmony search algorithm hsa which tun the weight of dbn to perform the multi-class class
for the effect class the multispect im is subject to the spars fuzzy c-means to form seg such that the feat extract is effect fre from dimend issu and comput complex
the feat extract from the seg of the multi-spectral im includ veget ind and stat feat
then thes feat ar fed to the dbn which is tun us the fhs algorithm for perform the land us class
expery us four dataset prov the effect of the propos multi-class class approach
the acc sensit and spec of the method ar found to be 0.9317 0.9568 and 0.0379 respect that is effect ov the ex land us class method .
