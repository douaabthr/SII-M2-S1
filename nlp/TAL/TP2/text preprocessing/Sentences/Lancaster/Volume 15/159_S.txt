yolov2 accel us embed gpu and fpgas pro con and a hybrid method
yolov2 is an object detect algorithm ground on the darknet neur network wid apply in the adv driv assist system
nevertheless the yolov2 algorithm must be accel on a high-performance comput platform bef being put into pract us
vary comput platform hav their spec feat
the merit or drawback of the accel platform ar hard for the develop to recogn and pick up the right altern bas on real demand
thi pap analys the pro and con of embed gpu and fpga for improv the yolov2 algorithm concern develop spee pow efficy and comput perform
the analys provid the develop with insight into choos the hardw to optim the yolov2 algorithm
accord to the expery dat it is found that if fpga is optim profound the perform of pow efficy as wel as spee wil excess embed gpu
howev the fpga develop proc is tough and demand much mor tim for develop than the gpu develop process
fin we propos a bal method to tak adv of gpu s develop spee and fgpa s high perform .
