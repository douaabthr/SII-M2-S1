apply cuckoo search bas algorithm and hybrid bas neur class for breast cant detect us ultrasound im
ultrasound examin is on of the most conveny and appropry process us for the diagnos of tum that mak us of ultrasound im
ultrasound im is a noninvas mod util common for the detect of breast cant which is a common and dang cant found in wom
thi pap propos an approach for the detect of breast cant us ultrasound im us mkf-cuckoo search mkf-cs algorithm and hybrid bas neur h-bn class
in pre-processing the input im to be diagnos ar pre-processed by roi extract us a novel algorithm four way search
the pre-processed im is allow to perform seg us mkf-cs algorithm
the key feat such as mean vary standard devy and so on ar extract in feat extract and ar fed to the propos h-bn class
bas on the train dat h-bn class class the dat into benign or malign tum class for the detect of breast cant
to evalu the perform of the propos mkfcs-hbn approach three met such as acc sensit and spec ar util
the expery result show that mkfcs-hbn could attain the maxim perform with an acc of 0.8889 the sensit of 1 and spec of 0.85 and thu prov it effect .
