optim scheduling algorithm for soft real-time system us partic swarm optim techn
scheduling of task in real-time system is bas on stat or dynam pri lik earliest deadlin first edf and rat monoton respect
the stat scheduler doe not giv ass of scheduling al task dur the underload scenario wherea dynam scheduler perform poor dur an overload scenario
thi pap has propos a swarm intelligence-based scheduling algorithm that can overcom both the situ
thi pap has us partic swarm optim pso bas swarm techn to design the new scheduling approach
it consid each task as a partic and apply mod pso techn to ident the most crit task to execut
the efficy of the new propos method has been comp with ex edf and aco bas scheduling algorithm consid two sign paramet the success ratio and the effect cpu util
al three algorithm hav been test on the sim with a soft real-time period task set on 500 timelin
it has been observ that dur the underload scenario the propos algorithm perform eq to edf and aco bas algorithm
dur overload and high overload situ the propos algorithm perform bat comp to edf and aco bas algorithm .
