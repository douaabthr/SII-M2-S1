expl the solv via retinex enh for fruit recognit impact of outdo sunlight a cas study of navel orang
machin vision-based techn ar on of the crit mean to real intellig orchard man
addit the third wav of art intellig guid by deep learn has promot the apply of machin vis technolog in fruit recognit
cur multipl detect model can extract the fruit from collect im yet the acc has oft ex devy due to diff observ tim caus correspond chang of sunlight throughout a day
consequ expl a method to solv thi problem is of gre sign to facilit smart orchard
on thi bas thi artic tak the navel orang as a study object divid four observ period 10 00 11 00 12 00 13 00 14 00 15 00 16 00 17 00 and two view dist of one-meter and two-meter to collect im dat
correspond algorithm ar design accord to each retinex process mod to assist the detect of yolov5 includ single-scal retinex ssr multi-scale retinex msr multi-scale retinex with col rest msrcr multi-scale retinex with chromaticity preserv msrcp and msrcr with autom col grad adjust automsrcr
the expery result show that two observ period of 10 00 11 00 and 14 00 15 00 ar mor conduc to the dat collect wher msr-based and msrcr-based model respect from the two period improv 9.28% and 6.32% of mean av precid map than origin yolov5 und one-meter view dist
also msrcr-based and automsrcr-based model achiev 4.92% and 16.91% of map high than the origin und two-meter view dist
simult thi artic also provid techn select schemes and analys the sensit of each model in typ impact scenario .
