select of inform gen from high-dimensional cant dat employ an improv meta-heuristic algorithm
id of the most promin gen with high class acc in the high-dimensional cant dat has remain an emerg challeng for machin learn research
the select of inform gen is a non-deterministic polynomial-time np-hard issu
theref a scop alway lie in employ new algorithm in thi field
in thi work an improv vert of a meta-heuristic algorithm chaot jay cjay is hybrid with kernel extrem learn machin kelm cal as cjaya-kelm to select the most inform gen and class the high-dimensional cant dat
init the fish scor techn is us to pre-select the inform gen
then the cjay algorithm is employ for both select key gen and optim the paramet of the kelm class
to evalu the design model six cant dataset ar consid
her the design model cjaya-kelm has been comp with partic swarm optim hybrid kelm pso-kelm genet algorithm hybrid kelm ga-kelm and jay hybrid kelm jaya-kelm model
moreov a comparison between the suggest model with oth ten ex model is demonst her
som perform met lik acc in tenfold cross-validation method the numb of select gen sensit f-measure spec and matthew correl coefficy mcc ar apply to meas the efficy of the suggest model
the cjaya-kelm approach result in the highest acc sensit and spec in colon tum . 9677 . 9714 . 963 leukem . 99 . 9756 1 ov cant 1 1 . 9892 lymphoma-3 . 9971 1 . 9583 all-aml-3 . 9961 . 9767 1 and srbct . 998 1 . 9583 dataset respect
the expery result rev that the suggest model cjaya-kelm is outperform .
