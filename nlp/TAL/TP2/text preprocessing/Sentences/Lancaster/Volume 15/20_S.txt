somdroid android malw detect by art neur network train us unsuperv learn
android has gain it popul due to it open-source and numb of fre avail ap in it off play stor
appropry funct of android ap depend upon the permit or set of permit which an ap demand at the tim of instal and run-time
by tak the adv of thes permit or set of permit cybercrimin ar develop malware-infected ap dai
in thi study we propos a framework nam as somdroid that work on the principl of unsuperv machin learn algorithm
to develop an effect and efficy android malw detect model we collect 5,00 000 distinct android ap from prom reposit and extract 1844 un feat
furth to select sign feat or feat set we apply six diff feat rank approach in thi study
with the select feat or feat set we impl the self-organizing map som algorithm of kohon and meas four distinct perform paramet i.e. intra-cluster dist inter-clust dist acc and f-measure
empir result rev that our propos framework is abl to detect 98.7% malw that belong to unknown famy and in addit to that the detect rat is high by 2% when comp to commerc anti-virus scan and framework propos in the lit .
