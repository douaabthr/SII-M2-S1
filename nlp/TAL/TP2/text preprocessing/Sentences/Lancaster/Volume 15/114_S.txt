optim feat select and hybrid deep learn for direct market campaign in bank apply
as stat by a mass market techn the object of market-based company is to maxim the produc of target direct market campaign oth than reach prospect and custom diff
the maxim return of the direct market campaign is bas on an appropry predict of the respons rat and an elab describ of the prospect
thi pap plan to develop a new direct market campaign model in bank apply us a hybrid deep learn architect
the propos model consist of sev step lik a dat acquisit b optim feat select and c predict
init the direct market campaign dat correspond to bank apply ar collect from oth googl sit lik portugues bank institut
with the collect inform optim feat select is perform in ord to reduc the dimend of the attribut or feat vect thu can reduc the complex of the predict algorithm
her the optim feat select is perform by a new vary of a meta-heuristic algorithm term as self adaptive-sea lion optim sa-slno algorithm
furth the optim collect feat ar subject to deep hybrid learn with the integr of deep believ network dbn and recur neur network rnn
as an improv to the deep learn model the hid neuron of both dbn and rnn ar optim by the sam sa-slno
the outcom of the hybrid class is the decid of the custom on bank deposit
fin the perform of the propos model is cert by comp ov the conv method through the evalu of relev perform meas .
