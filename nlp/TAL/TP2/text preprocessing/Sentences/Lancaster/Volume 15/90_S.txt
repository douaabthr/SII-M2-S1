improv rid for vehicul adhoc network rout via neur network
nowaday it is necess to know about the traff inform in a city for traff reg
the gath of effect traff inform help travel to mak bet decid regard the travel path
query lik how do we get traff inform ? and which path is the shortest dist between two vert ? ar wid address whil query of the typ how do we get traff inform efficy and econom ? and which path is the shortest travel tim between two vert ? nee furth analys
theref thi pap introduc a new shortest path select model which is bas on the shortest travel tim requir to travel sourc to destin
for thi predict an optim neur network model is introduc wher the hist dat is insist und the train process
the fact consid for predict the av travel tim to reach the destin ar congest level dist and tim interv respect
moreov the train is carry out us a new rid with an upd overtak evalu ru-oe
fin the bet of the pres approach is valid ov the ex model in term of certain meas .
