senty analys us convolv neur network via word embed
convolv neur network ar known for their excel perform in comput vis achiev result in the stat of the art
moreov rec research has shown that thes network can also provid prom result for nat langu process
in thi cas the bas ide is to cont the vect repres of word into a singl block and us it as an im
howev despit the good result the problem of us convolv network is the larg numb of design decid that nee to be madeá prior
thes model requir the definit of many hyper-parameters includ the typ of word embed which consist of the dat vect repres the act funct that print the non-linearity charact to the model the siz of the filt that apply dat convolv the numb of feat map which ar respons for ident the attribut and the pool method us for dat reduc
in addit on must also predefin the regul const and the dropout rat which ar respons for avoid any network over-fitting
in ex research work convolv neur network architect cap of overcom the perform of tradit machin learn model ar pres
ev though thes can compet with mor complex model the problem of how the diff set of the hyper-parameters may affect the perform of thi typ of network has not yet been expl
in thi pap we propos an efficy senty analys class us convolv neur network by analys the impact of the hyper-parameters on the model perform
the main interest in analys senty com from the adv of soc med and the technolog adv that flood the internet with opin
nonetheless min the internet for opin and senty analys is not an easy task and thu nee outstand model with the best hyper-parameters set to be abl to get pertin answ
the result achiev ar obtain with the us of gpu and show that the diff config excess the ref model in the most of the cas with gain of up to 18% and hav simil perform to the model of the stat of the art with gain of up to 2% in som cas .
