clust method and sin cosin algorithm for im seg
thi artic pres a new im seg approach bas on the principl of clust optim by the meta-heuristic algorithm nam sca algorithm sin cosin
thi algorithm us a mathem model bas on trigonomet funct to solv optim problem
such an approach was develop to solv the drawback ex in class clust techn such as the init of clust cent and converg toward the loc optim
in fact to obtain an optim clust cent and to improv the im seg qual we propos thi techn which begin with the gen of a random pop
then we determin the numb of clust to exploit
lat we form an object funct to maxim the interclass dist and minim the intra-class dist
the resolv of thi funct giv the best overal solv us to upd the rest of the pop
the perform of the propos approach ar evalu us a set of ref im and comp to sev class clust method lik k-means or fuzzy c-means and oth meta-heuristic approach such as genet algorithm and partic swarm optim
the result obtain from the diff method ar analys bas on the best fit valu psnr rmse sc xb pc s sc ce and the comput tim
the expery result show that the propos approach giv satisfact result comp to the oth method .
