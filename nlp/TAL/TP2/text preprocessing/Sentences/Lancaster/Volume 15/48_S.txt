dbfs dragonf bay fus system to detect the tamp jpeg im for forens analys
due to the adv of a vary of photo edit and im process softw im forens analys has becom an import research top in rec year
numb of research work ar pres for im forens analys
accord thi pap propos a method nam as dragonf bay fus system dbfs by integr the naiv bay nb class and the dragonf optim for detect the tamp joint photograph expert group im
init the input im is apply to the ex six forens tool sep and the class bin map is gen
then the propos dbfs fus thes decid for gen the optim decid
her the nb class cre the model by find the mean and vary of every feat and thi model is giv as input to the dragonf optim for optim gen the prob meas
fin the postery prob of each feat is determin with respect to the tamp class and the origin class and the tamp im block is determin
the perform of the propos system is evalu with the ex method such as fuzzy the bas class rule-based class av method and weight av method for the evalu met acc fals posit rat fpr and tru posit rat tpr
the expery result show that the propos system outperform the ex method by obtain the maxim acc of 0.9519 minim fpr of 0.0490 and maxim tpr of 0.8720 when comp to the ex method .
