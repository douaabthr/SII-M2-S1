ga-pparm constraint-based object funct and genet algorithm for priv preserv assocy rul min
now a day privacy-preserved dat min is an import research top that find sign inform from the databas whil hid sensit inform
numb of algorithm ar pres for cont sensit inform
thi pap pres the priv preserv assocy rul min by constraint-based object funct and the genet algorithm ga
the propos method us the frequ pattern fp grow algorithm for min the assocy rul from the databas
at first the fp-growth algorithm extract the fps from the databas by apply the support threshold and then gen the assocy rul from the fps by apply the confid threshold
then the gen assocy rul ar process by the ga for produc the priv preserv assocy rul whil preserv the sensit rul
fin the priv preserv assocy rul ar provid to the third party us
the perform of the propos method is evalu with the ex partic swarm optim pso for the evalu met priv and util
the expery result show that the propos method min the priv preserv assocy rul from the databas with the maxim priv of 0.124 and the minim util of 0.0989 when comp to the ex method .
