a new art bee colony algorithm us a grad weight method for the bi-objective travel salesm problem
the travel salesm problem tsp is a typ problem in combin optim
the un object of the tradit tsp is to minim the tour dist
when mor than on object is tak into account to be optim simult the problem is known as a multi-objective tsp
in the pres pap a bi-objective travel salesm problem botsp is consid wher both the cost and the dist ar tak as optim object
we introduc a new algorithm that solv the botsp cal gw-abc
thi algorithm is bas on an art bee colony algorithm abc and us a grad weight gen method
first we apply a grad method to prep the weight vect
in fact weight vect valu ar grad distribut in the object spac and chang rel to the optim process from cyc to anoth
second we apply the abc algorithm with the gen weight to our problem
the propos algorithm is expery test on well-known benchmark inst of diff siz and comp with oth state-of-the-art algorithm
the obtain expery result show that gw-abc is sign bet .
