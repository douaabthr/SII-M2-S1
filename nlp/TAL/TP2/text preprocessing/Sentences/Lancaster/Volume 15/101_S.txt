hybrid neighb and glob replac strategies for mult object evolv algorithm bas on decomposit
in multi-objective evolv algorithm bas on decomposit replac strategy rs play a key rol in bal pop converg and divers
howev the ex rss eith foc on the neighb or glob replac strategy which may hav difficul in solv the complex multi-objective optim problem
to solv thi problem a hybrid neighb and glob replac strategies for multi-objective evolv algorithm bas on decomposit moea/d is propos
in thi mech a prob thresholdptis us to determin wheth to impl neighb or glob replac strategy to bal converg and divers
meanwhil an offspr gen method is design to gen high-quality offspr solv for each sub-problem which can improv the success of the replac strategy
bas on moea/d a new moea/d-hrs algorithm is design and it is comp with som state-of-the-art multi-objective evolv algorithm moea in a sery of bi-objective and three-objective test inst with linear or nonlinear vary link
the expery result show that moea/d-hrs can achiev the best perform in most test inst .
