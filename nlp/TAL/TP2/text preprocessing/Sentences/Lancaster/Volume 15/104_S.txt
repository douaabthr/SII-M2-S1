chaot vortex search algorithm metah algorithm for feat select
the vortex search algorithm vsa is a meta-heuristic algorithm that has been inspir by the vortex phenomenon propos by dog and olmez in 2015
lik oth meta-heuristic algorithm the vsa has a maj problem it can easy get stuck in loc optim solv and provid solv with a slow converg rat and low acc
thu chao the has been ad to the search process of vsa in ord to spee up glob converg and gain bet perform
in the propos method vary chaot map hav been consid for improv the vsa op and help to control both exploit and expl
the perform of thi method was evalu with 24 uc standard dataset
in addit it was evalu as a feat select fs method
the result of sim show that chaot map particul the tent map ar abl to enh the perform of the vsa
furtherm it was clear shown the fit of the propos method in attain the optim feat subset with utmost acc and the least numb of feat
if the numb of feat is eq to 36 the perc of acc in vsa and the propos model is 77.49 and 92.07
if the numb of feat is 80 the perc of acc in vsa and the propos model is 36.37 and 71.76
if the numb of feat is 3343 the perc of acc in vsa and the propos model is 95.48 and 99.70
fin the result on real apply show that the propos method has high perc of acc in comparison to oth algorithm .
