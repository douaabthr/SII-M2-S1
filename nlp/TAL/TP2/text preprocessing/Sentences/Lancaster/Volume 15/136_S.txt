frequ offset estim bas on a combin of fft and czt for dp-qdb coh receiv
a new frequency-offset-estimation foe method for dual-polarized quadr duobin mod dp-qdb which is bas on a combin of fast foury transform fft and chirp z transform czt is propos
thi method is investig at 128 gb/s in five-channel wavelength-division-multiplexing dp-qdb system by sim
the sim result show that the propos method can gre promot foe acc
when the propos method with fft and czt point of 1024 is comp with the tradit unimprov method with fft point of 2048 the form is 70% low than the lat in foe er in the cas of bas the sam comput complex
besid two foe impl schemes for dp-qdb ar comp
it is found that the impl scheme in which the foe mod is put aft the post filt has bet estim perform .
