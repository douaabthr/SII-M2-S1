optim sens plac scheme for target cov with minim interf us bbo
a wireless sens network wsn consist of a group of energy-constrained tiny dev cal sens which hav sens process and commun cap
thes sens ar deploy in a reg of interest for monit target or detect ev and forward the process dat to the sink nod or gateway
in any wireless network scenario the target ar to be cov by at least on sens in the network in ord to detect certain ev
maxim cov along with improv energy efficy of the network is a funda issu in wsn
theref a biogeograph bas optim bbo meta-heuristic techn is employ to plac sens in the reg of interest
the propos scheme solv a multi-objective problem us class weight sum approach
a fit funct is der from combin of conflict object minim interf maxim target cov and select of minim numb of sens nod along with connect of the network as a constraint
the scheme select minim numb of sens to deploy in the field of interest which maxim the target cov by minim the interf of sens
the propos scheme is test on random and grid deploy scenario
fin the scheme is comp with genet algorithm and random scheme
the av interf energy loss on bbo-based scheme is found to be 16% less than that of the ga-based scheme and 60% less than that of a random-based scheme .
