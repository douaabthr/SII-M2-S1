rank-based un feat select method on machin learn class for cod smel detect
detect cod smel and tre them with refact ar triv part of maintain vast and soph softw
ther is an urg nee for autom system to tre cod smel
tool provid vary result bas on threshold valu and subject interpret of smel
machin learn is on of the best approach that provid effect solv to thi problem
practit do not nee expert knowledg on smel s charact for detect which mak thi approach access
in thi pap we hav impl 32 machin learn algorithm aft perform feat select through six vary of the filt method
we hav us multipl correl methodolog to discard simil feat
mut inform fish scor and un roc auc feat select techn wer us with brut forc and random forest correl strategies
feat select elimin dimend curs and improv perform meas drast
it is the select of relev feat subset bas on the rel between depend and independ vary
we hav comp perform of class impl with and without perform feat select
result show that acc of machin learn model has increas up to 26.5% f-measure by 70.9% are und roc curv has surg up to 26.74% and av train tim has reduc up to 62 s as comp to perform meas of machin learn model execut without feat select
mut inform feat select strategy with random forest correl methodolog has the highest impact on perform meas among al the filt method
among 32 class boost decid tre j48 and naiv bay algorithm gav best perform aft dimend reduc .
