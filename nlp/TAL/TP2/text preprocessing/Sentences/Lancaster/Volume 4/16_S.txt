evolv comput as an art attack gen evas attack for detect vuln test
intrud detect system protect our infrastruct by monit for sign of intrud
howev intrud detect system ar themselv suscept to vuln which the attack tak adv of to evad detect
in particul we foc on evas attack in which the attack aim to gen a stealthy attack that elimin or minim the lik of detect
attack achiev steal by mimick norm behavio whil achiev the attack goal hent bypass the detect
prevy work focus on gen evas attack us the intern knowledg of the detect hent adopt a white-box access to the detect
on the oth hand we adopt a black-box approach and propos an evolv attack bas on genet program
the access of our black-box approach is limit to the feedback of the detect such as anoma rat and delay
we comp our black-box approach with vary white-box approach to investig it effect
in doing so the impact of anoma from the break-in stag of the attack and the delay bas on loc fram count ar also discuss
thi is particul import if the perform comparison is to reflect the real cap of detect .
