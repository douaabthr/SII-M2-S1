evolv scal and modul adapt network with develop symbol encod
evolv neur network or neuroevolv appear to be a prom way to build versatil adapt system combin evolv and learn
on of the most challeng problem of neuroevolv is find a scal and robust genet repres which would allow to effect grow increas complex network for increas complex task
in thi pap we propos a novel develop encod for network feat scal modul regul and hierarchy
the encod allow to repres structural regul of network and build them from encaps and poss reus subnetwork
thes cap ar demonst on sev test problem
in particul for par and symmetry problem we evolv solv which ar ful gen with respect to the numb of input
we also evolv scal and modul weightless recur network cap of autonom learn in a simpl gen class task
the encod is very flex and we demonst thi by evolv network cap of learn via neuromod
fin we evolv modul solv to the retin problem for which anoth wel known neuroevolv method hypern was prevy shown to fail
the propos encod outperform hypern and cellul encod also in anoth expery in which certain connect pattern must be discov between lay
theref we conclud the propos encod is an interest and competit approach to evolv network .
