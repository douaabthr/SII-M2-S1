surrogate-assisted clon select algorithm for expend optim problem
clon select algorithm ar comput method inspir by the behavy of the immun system which can be apply to solv optim problem
howev lik oth nat inspir algorithm they can requir a larg numb of object funct evalu in ord to reach a satisfact solv
when thos evalu involv a comput expend sim model their cost becom prohibit
in thi pap we analys the us of surrog model in ord to enh the perform of a clon select algorithm
comput expery ar conduc to assess the perform of the pres techn us a benchmark with 22 test-problems und a fix budget of object funct evalu
the comparison show that for most cas the us of surrog model improv sign the perform of the baselin clon select algorithm .
