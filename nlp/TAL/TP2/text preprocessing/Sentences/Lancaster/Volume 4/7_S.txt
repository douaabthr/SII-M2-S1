collect class of text docu by guid self-organization in t-cell cross-regulation dynam
we pres and study an agent-based model of t-cell cross-regulation in the adapt immun system which we apply to bin class
our method expand an ex analys model of t-cell cross-regulation carneiro et al
in immunol rev 216 1 48 68,2007 that was us to study the self-organizing dynam of a singl pop of t-cells in interact with an id antig pres cel cap of pres a singl antig
with agent-based model we ar abl to study the self-organizing dynam of multipl pop of distinct t-cells which interact via antig pres cel that pres hundr of distinct antig
moreov we show that such self-organizing dynam can be guid to produc an effect bin class of antig which is competit with ex machin learn method when apply to biom text class
mor spec her we test our model on a dataset of publ avail full-text biom artic provid by the biocr challeng kral in the biocr ii
5 challeng overview p 19,2009
we study the robust of our model s paramet config and show that it lead to enco result comp to state-of-the-art class
our result help us understand both t-cell cross-regulation as a gen principl of guid self-organization as wel as it appl to docu class
theref we show that our bio-inspired algorithm is a prom novel method for biom artic class and for bin docu class in gen .
