paramet control of metah with genet fuzzy system
thi pap introduc a genet fuzzy system for paramet control of metah
two bas metah hav been consid as exampl genet algorithm and tabu search
the control paramet of the tabu search ar the short and long term mem
paramet of the genet algorithm und control ar the mut and reproduc rat
fuzzy rule-based model off a nat mech to describ glob behavy as a combin of control rul
they also inherit a mean to grad shift between control rul which joint defin a control strategy
they ar a nat candid to construct paramet control strategies becaus they provid a way to develop decid mech bas on the spec nat of search reg and transit between their bound
an apply exampl us the class vehic rout problem with tim window is includ to evalu the genet fuzzy system perform
expery result show that gfs-controlled metah improv search behavy and solv qual when comp against standard const paramet genet and tabu search approach
it also provid reason good suboptim solv fast than spec tail exact method report in the lit .
