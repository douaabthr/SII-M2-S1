stochast gradient-caviar-based deep believ network for text categ
text categ is defin as the process of assign tag to text accord to it cont
som of the text class approach ar docu org spam email filt and new group
thi pap introduc stochast gradient-caviar-based deep believ network for text categ
the overal proc of the propos approach involv four step such as pre-processing feat extract feat select and text categ
at first the pre-processing is carry out from the input dat bas on stem stop-word remov and then the feat extract is perform us a vect spac model
ont the extract is don the feat select is carry out bas on entrop
subsequ the select feat ar giv to the text categ step
her the text categ is don us the propos sg-cav-based deep believ network sg-cav-based dbn
the propos sg-cav is us to train the dbn which is design by combin condit autoregress valu at risk and stochast grady desc
the perform of the propos sgcav dbn is evalu bas on the met such as recal precid f-measure and acc
also the perform of the propos method is comp with the ex method such as naiv bay k-nearest neighbo support vect machin and deep believ network dbn
from the analys it is depict that the propos sgcav dbn method achiev the maxim precid of 0.78 the maxim recal of 0.78 maxim f-measure of 0.78 and the maxim acc of 0.95
among the ex method dbn achiev the maxim precid recal f-measure and acc for 20 newsgroup databas and reut databas
the perform of the propos system is 10.98% 11.54% 11.538% and 18.33% high than the precid recal f-measure and acc of the dbn for 20 newsgroup databas and 2.38% 2.38% 2.37% and 0.21% high than the precid recal f-measure and acc of the dbn for reut databas .
