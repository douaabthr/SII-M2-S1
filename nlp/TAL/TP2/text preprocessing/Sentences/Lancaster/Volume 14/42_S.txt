an efficy system model to minim sign interf and delay in mobl cloud environ
the integr of mobl comput with cloud comput has increas adv to the us to access the apply from anywh at any tim
the tradit cellul system is overlaid by numb of low pow nod which allow us to attain serv at any tim
but the increas of femto cel caus intra-tier inter-ti interf and delay in the network
to overcom the bottleneck a sub-modular optim bas offload algorithm is propos in thi pap wher the task is divid into two funct and process
the main aim is to optim execut tim and interf
the sim result show that the execut tim has been reduc by 57.89% and perform wel to obtain optim solv comp to oth ex method .
