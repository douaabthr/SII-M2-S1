mass mimo perspect improv sea lion for optim antenn select
the mass mimo is an adv technolog in the wideband wireless commun system s fut which provok extend at in both academ and telecommun industry
pilot contamin is consid as a funda issu in the system of mass mimo
the design of wireless system has the main concern ov the system throughput
though the environ protect and energy-saving hav concern as inevit trend and glob demand
hent on consid al thes consequ thi pap intend to introduc a new improv sea lion optim algorithm to select the optim transmit antenna select by account the multi-objective issu that maxim both the rel energy efficy and capac
in fact the propos algorithm is the enh vert of tradit sea lion optim algorithm which optim tun the count of transmit antenna and determin which antenn to be select
fin the perform of propos work is comp and prov ov oth conv model regard capac analys rel efficy analys and optim antenn select analys as wel .
