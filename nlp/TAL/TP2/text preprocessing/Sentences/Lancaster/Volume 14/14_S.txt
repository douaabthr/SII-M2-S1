multi-agent path plan with nonlinear restrict
thi pap pres a novel simpl mathem model that can solv a path plan problem compr three ag in a triangul form
the problem is model to optim the traject of the ag and to minim the dist travel
the traject ar obtain in a way that devy them from fix obstac whos dimend ar known
furtherm geometry and ory constraint of the form of the multi-agent ar impos
heur method such as the genet algorithm diff evolv and partic swarm optim ar apply to solv the non-linear algebra equ which repres the system
comparison ar pres among the result of the diff method highlight the process tim and the converg to the glob minim solv
the result prov that al the algorithm can be apply to the path plan problem with constraint
the partic swarm optim method pres the lowest process tim for al sim cas
howev the diff evolv method is mor robust than the oth when search for the glob minim solv .
