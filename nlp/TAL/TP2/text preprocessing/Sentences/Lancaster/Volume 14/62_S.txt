non-dominated sort genet algorithm nsga-iii for effect resourc alloc in cloud
resourc man system help the enterpr to coordin the it resourc in connect to the act perform by the key play such as cloud custom and serv provid
pres day cloud resourc and serv provid us a heterog alloc strategy for resourc alloc across vary geograph loc
furth thes alloc ar complet in nee of sec transact effect scheduling and dynam resourc alloc strategies
to overcom the abov ment issu thi pap propos a novel resourc alloc framework for the cloud serv provid to schedule and effect resourc alloc
the key ide of the propos resourc alloc scheme is to util non domin sort genet algorithm nsga-iii to effect alloc resourc
furtherm the propos nsga-iii is mod to support any interim dat sourc any middl war
the propos model is expery valid in the test bed with multi-node hadoop clust
the expery result confirm that the propos model outperform the ex stat of the art model such as lion optim tradit aco and partic bas kernel funct algorithm with mor than 95% in acc .
