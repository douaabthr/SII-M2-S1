veloc adapt bas pso for loc in wireless sens network
wireless sens network ar a network of sens interconnect through a wireless med
wireless sens network ar util for many array of apply wher determin prec loc of the sens ar tre to be the cruc task
the prim job of loc is to determin the exact loc of sens plac at particul are as it mak the ref of anch nod to determin the loc of remain nod in the network
posit inform of sens nod in an are is us for rout techn and som apply spec task
the loc acc is affect due to the estim in anch nod plac
loc inform is not alway easy as it vary with respect to the environ in which the sens ar deploy
rang er occ in hostil environ and acc effect as ther ar sign attenu in sens when deploy underw underground etc
efficy can be enh by reduc the er us loc algorithm
partic swarm optim is on approach to overcom the loc problem
result ar consid for loc algorithm lik partic swarm optim soc group optim and veloc adapt bas partic swarm optim
the goal of thi work is to impl a veloc adapt bas partic swarm optim for loc method to achiev minim er
the result rev that the propos approach work bet for obtain improv loc acc .
