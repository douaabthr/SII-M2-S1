intrud detect system for cloud forens us bayes fuzzy clust and optim bas svnn
intrud detect has emerg as on of the maj challeng involv in the cloud forens
thi work introduc an intrud detect framework for the cloud environ with clust and two-level class
in the first step of the process a bayes fuzzy clust is us for clust the nod in the cloud
and in the next step two-level gravit group search-based support vect neur network gg-svnn class ident intrud in clust
gg-svnn is a novel optim scheme propos in thi work by combin the group search optim and gravit search algorithm
the intrud inform provid by level 1 class is arrang to form compact dat and provid to the level 2 class
the level 2 class fin ident tot nod affect by the intrud
the sim of the propos intrud detect is don with the help of kdd cup dataset
from the sim result it is evid that the propos gg-svnn class has achiev overal best perform by achiev high acc valu of 92.41% and low fals alarm rat of 4.75% respect .
