superv machin learn approach to predict qualit softw produc
softw develop process sdp is a framework impos on softw produc develop and is a multi-stage process wherein a wid rang of task and act pan out in each stag
each stag requir car observ to improv produc qual etc
to eas the process of develop
dur each stag problem surfac lik constraint of on-time complet prop util of avail resourc and appropry trac of work progress etc
and may lead to reit due to the defect spot dur test and then result into the neg walk-through due to unsatisfact outcom
work on such defect can help to tak a step toward the prop ste of act and thu to improv the expect perform of the softw produc
handpick the prop not feat of sdp and then analys their nat toward the outcom can gre help in get a rely softw produc by meet the expect object
thi pap propos superv machin learn ml model for the predict of bet sdp particul focus on cost estim defect predict and reus
the expery study wer conduc on the prim dat and the evalu rev the model suit in term of efficy and effect for sdp predict acc of cost estim 65% defect predict 93% and reus 82% .
