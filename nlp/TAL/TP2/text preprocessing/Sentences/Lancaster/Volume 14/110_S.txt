hybrid partic swarm optim with partic elimin for the high school timet problem
in thi pap a pso-based algorithm that hybrid partic swarm optim pso and hil climb hc is apply to high school timet problem
thi hybrid has two feat a novel solv transform and partic elimin
the propos methodolog ar test on the xhstt-2014 dataset which is rel new for the school timet problem plu oth addit inst
the expery result show that the propos algorithm is effect in solv smal and med inst comp to standalon hc and bet than the conv pso for most inst
in a comparison to the stat of the art method it achiev the lowest mean of soft constraint viol for 7 inst and the lowest mean of hard constraint viol for 1 inst .
