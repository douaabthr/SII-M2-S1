im compress us expl bat algorithm by reny 2 d histogram bas on multilevel thresholding
the main object of the im compress is to extract mean clust from a giv im
a mean clust is poss with perfect threshold valu which ar optim by assum reny entrop as an object funct
due to the eq distribut of energy ov the entir 1 d histogram it is comput complex
in ord to improv the vis qual of a reconstruct im a 2 d histogram bas multilevel thresholding is propos to maxim the reny entrop us expl bat algorithm
thu proc result ar comp with oth optim techn and thes ar incorp
it is the first tim incorp a weight peak sign to nois ratio wpsnr and the vis psnr vpsnr in the propos method becaus of the fail in meas the vis qual of peak sign to nois ratio psnr
expery result ar examin on a standard set of im which ar observ prec and efficy in the multilevel thresholding problem .
