diff evolv algorithm tun tilt integr der control with filt control for autom gen control
a diff evolv de tun tilt integr der control with filt tidf has been impl to a mult are reh therm pow system for autom gen control by tak the phys constraint lik gen rat constraint and govern dead band nonlinear
init dissimil integr control ar consid in each are and the integr control gain hav been optim by integr of tim multiply by absolv valu of er ita crit exploit diff strategies of de algorithm
in next step the control paramet such as step siz and crossov prob of de for the best strategy can be chos with multipl it of the algorithm system for vary in each control paramet and de propos the control paramet
furth pi/pid/tidf typ control schemes hav been mod and their gain hav been optim by optim de
furtherm to improv the transy system respons tidf control coordin un pow flow control upfc has been investig
the sim result rev that the minim ita valu is obtain when upfc is plac in area-5 on
fin sensit analys has been don by chang the op load condit along with the tim const of system paramet from the sim result it has been examin that ther is no nee to reset the control paramet from their nomin set for thes vary
the propos control scheme effect is also observ by consid random step load disturb and sinusoid load disturb .
