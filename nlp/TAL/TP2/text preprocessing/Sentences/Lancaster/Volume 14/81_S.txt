neuromod multiobject evolv neurocontrol without specy
neuromod is a biologically-inspired techn that can adapt the per-connection learn rat of synapt plast
neuromod has been us to facilit unsuperv learn by adapt neur network weight
multiobject evolv of neur network topolog and weight has been us to design neurocontrol for autonom robot
thi pap pres a novel multiobject evolv neurocontrol with unsuperv learn for robot navig
multiobject evolv of network weight and topolog neat-mods is aug with neuromod learn
neat-mods is an nsga-ii bas multiobject neurocontrol that us two conflict object
the first reward the robot when it mov in a direct man with minim turn the second object is to reach as many target as poss
neat-mods us specy a select process that aim to ens pareto-optimal genotyp divers and elit
the effect of the design is demonst us a sery of expery with a sim robot travers a simpl maz contain target goal
it is shown that when neuromod learn is combin with multiobject evolv better-performing neur control ar synthes than by evolv alon
second it is demonst that specy is unnecess in neuromod neuroevolv as neuromod preserv topolog innov
the propos neuromod approach is found to be stat supery to neat-mods alon when apply to solv a multiobject navig problem .
