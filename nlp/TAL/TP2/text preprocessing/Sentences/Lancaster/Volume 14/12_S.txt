on the cryptanalys of s-des us nat inspir optim algorithm
cryptanalys has emerg to be an import top in the er of modern emerg technolog
the cryptanalys of simpl dat encrypt standard s-des is a np-hard combin problem
thi pap has two goal
first we study the cryptanalys of s-des via nature-inspired meta-heuristic algorithm nam cuckoo search firef and black-hole optim algorithm
each of thes algorithm is bas on fascin nat phenomen and exploit the inh un of such phenomen to solv optim problem
second we pres a comp study on the efficy of thes three fair new algorithm with that of prevy est memet algorithm and genet algorithm in regard to s-des cryptanalys
through expery and extend test it has been shown that the propos algorithm bas on cuckoo search prov to be most efficy with respect to acc and execut tim .
