self-adaptive learn for hybrid genet algorithm
loc search can be introduc into genet algorithm to cre a hybrid but any improv in perform is depend on the learn mech
in the lamarck model a candid solv is replac by a fit neighbo if on is found by loc search
in the baldwin model the origin solv is retain but with an upgrad fit if a fit solv is found in the loc search spac
the effect of us eith model or a vary proport of the two within a hybrid genet algorithm is affect by the topolog of the fit funct and the detail of the hybrid algorithm
thi pap investig an intellig adapt approach to decid on the learn mech to be us by an individ ov the cours of the search
evolv is us to self-adapt both the frequ of a steepest-desc loc search and the rel proport of lamarck and baldwin inherit
expery hav shown that thi form of adapt learn can improv the abl to find high-quality solv and can accel the hybrid search without the nee to find optim control paramet for the learn process .
