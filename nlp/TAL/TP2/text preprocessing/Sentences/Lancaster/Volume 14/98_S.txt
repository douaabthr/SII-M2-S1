dna mot discovery us chem react optim
dna mot discovery mean to find short simil sequ el within a set of nucleotid sequ
it has becom a compuls nee in bioinform for it us apply such as compress summ and clust algorithm
mot discovery is an np-hard problem and exact algorithm cannot solv it in polynom tim
many optim algorithm wer propos to solv thi problem
howev non of them can show it suprem by overcom al the obstac
chem react optim cro is a pop bas metah algorithm that can easy fit for the optim problem
her we hav propos an algorithm bas on chem react optim techn to solv the dna mot discovery problem
the four bas op of cro hav been redesign for thi problem to search the solv spac loc as wel as glob
two addit op repair funct hav been propos to improv the qual of the solv
they hav been apply to the fin solv aft the it stag of cro to get a bet on
us the flex mech of el op of cro along with the addit op repair funct it is poss to determin mot mor prec
our propos method is comp with oth tradit algorithm such as gib sampl alignac align nuc acid conserv el mem multipl expect maxim for mot elicit and acr ant-colony-regulatory-identification by test real-world dataset
the expery result show that the propos algorithm can giv bet result than oth tradit algorithm in qual and in less run tim
besid stat test hav been perform to show the supery of the propos algorithm ov oth state-of-the-arts in thi are .
