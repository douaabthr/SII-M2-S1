multi-objective three level parallel pso algorithm for structural align of complex rna sequ
thi pap introduc a cach en parallel multi-objective tri-level partic swarm optim algorithm mo-3 lppso with object to address a challeng np-hard problem from bioinform i. e
structural align of complex rna sequ
mo-3 lppso impl master-slave topolog bas commun strategy on the paral connect machin via mess pass interfac mpi
level 1 of the propos algorithm acquir the optim align of the sequ distribut on slav process in the ord of their complex
furth the align sequ along with their align scor ar stor on the mast process
in the second level the second structures of al thegbestalign sequ of level 1 is obtain
each sequ set is distribut on a slav process that construct second structure of al sequ from the set
the align scor and second structure scor obtain from level 1 and level 2 now mov toward level 3 form a bi-objective optim problem with the object to maxim sequ simil scor and minim fre energy scor for most stabl rna second structure
the top-level non-dominated solv ar extract furth in level three and the extern arch in ctrie is upd
the improv from mo-tlpso to mo-3 lppso has been remark in the sens includ of ctrie en the algorithm to work with multi-client environ for handl rna structural align query impl of parallel facilit structural align of high complex mass dataset of rna sequ
furth the diff between the tim tak by mo-tlpso and mo-3 lppso is found extrem sign as confirm by non-parametric stat test mann-whitney u test
furth the structural align of high complex sequ set is perform by mo-3 lppso which is test for predict acc and process tim
the algorithm is found produc high acc result at sign less process tim .
