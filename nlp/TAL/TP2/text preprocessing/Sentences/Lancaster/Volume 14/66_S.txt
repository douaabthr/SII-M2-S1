an efficy hybrid pso polygam crossov bas clust algorithm
clust of dat into coher group is an op are of research with lot of apply in diff domain
many tradit and metah algorithm hav been propos in the lit but the main inh problem with most of thes algorithm is that they can easy get trap in loc optim and can lead to prem converg
thu a sign bal is requir between expl and exploit to find a near optim solv
thi pap attempt to resolv thi problem by propos a real encod hybrid algorithm psopc us pso for glob search and polygam approach for crossov in ord to refin the expl and exploit strategy
paramet lik inert weight crossov prob and alph valu in arithmet crossov ar also tun dynam to refin the optim process
the propos hybrid algorithm is sim on sev real lif dat set
it has also been comp with oth four standard wel known metah clust algorithm i. e
partic swarm optim genet algorithm diff evolv firef algorithm and grey wolf optim
the comput result demonst that the psopc outperform oth approach in context of within clust dist clust qual meas and converg spee to find the near optim solv
sim result clear rev that the propos algorithm psopc is abl to gen compact clust
vary extern qual evalu meas lik precid sensit acc and g-measure us for qual evalu demonst that the propos algorithm is abl to perform bet clust than the oth comp algorithm .
