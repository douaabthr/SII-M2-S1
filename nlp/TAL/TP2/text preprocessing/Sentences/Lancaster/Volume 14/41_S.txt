deep learn bas dynam task offload in mobl cloudlet environ
the mobl comput world is migr from 4g to 5g and on of the maj off of 5g is the seamless comput pow and it is the maj set back in the cur scenario
the maj difficul that nee to be address ar comput qual of serv
spee pow and sec
thi research pap aim in address the issu of task man in the mobl system that is direct rel to qual
the artic propos a deep learning-based algorithm that perform dynam task offload in the mobl cloudlet sint cloudlet aid in the reduc of the delay that occ in the wlan
the delay in perform task is on of the maj drawback of cloudlet that it is depr of resourc when comp to cloud serv due to which the task that ar to be perform ar divid and is design to mobl dev diff cloud serv and cloudlet itself
theref to determin the combin of dev requir to perform diff task deep learn algorithm ar consid
the algorithm is respons to ident the subtask the subtask that has to be computed/execut in which dev or cloudlet or cloud serv
the propos algorithm is nam deep learn bas dynam task offload in mobl cloudlet dldto
the algorithm is impl and comp with cloudlet bas dynam task offload cdto
the overal analys and comparison with the ex cdto for job alloc prov that the perform of the propos dldto algorithm is bet in term of energy consum and complet tim .
