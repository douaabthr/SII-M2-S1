dat aug for cant class in oncogenom an improv knn bas approach
ther is cur a gre nee for research in gen express dat to help with cant class in the field of oncogenom
thi is espec tru sint the diseas occ sporad and oft doe not show symptom
typ gen express dat is disproport with a larg numb of feat and a low numb of sampl
a smal sampl siz is lik to advers affect acc of class as the perform of a class depend larg on the dat
ther is a press nee to gen dat which could be provid as bet input to class
primit aug techn lik uniform random gen and addit of nois do not ass good prob distribut
second as we deal with crit apply the aug dat nee to hav gre lik to the origin valu
thu we propos an improv vary of k-nearest neighb knn rul
we us count quoty filt euclid dist and mean best valu from the k-neighbors for each target sampl to get synthet sampl
a comparison is drawn amongst the raw dat from publ domain origin dat dat gen us standard k-nearest neighb rul and dat gen us improv k-nearest neighb rul
the dat gen through thes approach is then furth class us state-of-art class lik svm j48 and dnn
the sampl gen through our improv techn yield bet recal valu than the standard impl ens sensit of dat
av class acc from al the three class conclud enh of 7.72% as comp to tradit knn approach and 16% when raw dat is consid as input to the class
thu the propos algorithm attain two object first ens sensit of dat for crit apply and second enh class acc .
