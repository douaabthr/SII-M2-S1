analys of net asset valu predict us low complex neur network with vary expand techn
net asset valu nav is a cruc meas that rev the fin condit of a mut fund and it predict becom import in decid mak espec for fund man
for thi purpos sev work hav been don us flan for nav predict
howev when it com to flan model the cho of vary paramet and expand funct has hug impact on the perform of the predict must be consid
thi study focus on the object of find the optim paramet for each model built with on typ of funct expand and comp them to find the most suit for nav predict
comparison mad on the learn rat the slid widow s siz the numb of expand rev that thes paramet must be found by heur test for each expand
the analys on the numb of day ahead of predict show that legendr expand is mor appropry for short term predict wherea pow sery expand giv good result for both short and long-term predict
in cas of converg pow sery follow by chebyshev expand converg fast than the oth model .
