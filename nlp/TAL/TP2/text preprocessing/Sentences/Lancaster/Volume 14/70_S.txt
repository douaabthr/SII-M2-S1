improv gbest art bee colony algorithm for the constraint optim problem
liv being in nat ar most intellig cre of nat as they evolv with tim and try to find optim solv for each problem individ or collect
art bee colony algorithm is nat inspir algorithm that mim the swarm behavio of honey bee and success solv vary optim problem
solv qual in art bee colony depend on the step siz dur posit upd
random decid step siz alway has high poss of miss out the exact solv
it popul vary nam gbest-guided art bee colony algorithm tri to bal it and accompl effect for unconstrain optim problem but not satisfact for the constrain optim problem
furth in the gbest-guided art bee colony individ which ar going to upd their posit attract toward the cur best solv in the swarm which sometim lead to prem converg
to avoid such situ as wel as to enh the efficy of gbest-guided art bee colony to solv the unconstrain continu optim problem an improv vary is propos her
the improv gbest-guided art bee colony propos mod in the posit upd dur both the phas i. e
employ and onlook bee phas to introduc divers in search spac addit intens of the ident reg
the perform of new algorithm is evalu for 21 benchmark optim problem
bas on stat analys it is shown that the new vary is a viabl altern of gbest-guided art bee colony for the constraint optim problem .
