random offset minim in low frequ front-end ampl us swarm intellig bas techn
random offset in ampl ar main due to random vary i. e
inh mismatch in transist paramet and gre impact it overal design spec espec in cas of low frequ apply
it must be minim for high precid in the ampl s perform
a new approach for minim of random offset volt in ampl has been propos through the us of swarm intellig bas optim algorithm due to their der fre nat and easy search mech
the approach involv first model the random offset volt due to mismatch between transist paramet bas on pelgrom s model and then minim the form model subject to design constraint us swarm intellig bas algorithm
two cas study ar consid first a high swing fold cascod op transconduc ampl ot and second a recyc fold cascod rfc ot
comp analys hav been perform by record best worst and mean dat for 2500 funct evalu and also us stat analys such as friedman s test and man whitney s u test
the result ind that the hybrid whal partic swarm optim hwpso algorithm outperform the oth stat of the art algorithm by giv a minim random offset volt of 7.2 mv and 1.452 mv with a mean rank of 1.55 and 1.75 for the 1st and 2nd cas study respect
valid of hwpso result hav been don by perform sim and mont carlo analys for the two ampl in cad virtuoso which ar found to be in clos agr with the algorithm result .
