gsapso-mqc med im encrypt bas on genet sim an partic swarm optim and mod quant chao system
due to the larg amount of im inform dat high redund and high pixel correl the tradit med im encrypt algorithm is easy to be attack by chos plaintext
theref a new med im encrypt algorithm combin genet sim an partic swarm optim and mod quant chao system is propos to obtain bet sec perform
first an improv quant chaot system is us to gen the key stream
then the select and cross op of genet algorithm ar us to process the plaintext im
the optim sequ gen by sim an algorithm is us to scramble the im
meanwhil the partic swarm optim pso algorithm is introduc into the sim an mech
the init temp is set accord to the optim fit valu of the init pop
metropol is us to optim the gen of individ optim posit and glob optim posit and the inert weight paramet of pso algorithm ar optim to avoid partic fal into loc optim in the optim process and improv the converg spee of the algorithm
through thes three op the histogram of the scrambled im can be eq to resist stat attack
expery result and perform analys show that the encrypt system propos in thi pap can resist many typ attack such as histogram analys correl analys diff attack and viol attack and has high sec and encrypt efficy
comp with oth encrypt method the encrypt efficy of our propos method has improv by approxim 10% .
