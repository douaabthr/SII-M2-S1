fpa clust evalu of the flow pollin algorithm for dat clust
in thi work a standalon approach bas on the flow pollin algorithm fpa is propos for solv dat clust problem
the fpa is a nature-inspired algorithm sim the behavy of flow pollin
the propos approach is us to extract key inform in term of optim clust cent that ar der from train sampl of the select databas
thes extract clust cent ar then valid on test sampl
three dataset from the uc machin learn dat reposit and an addit multi-spectral real-time satellit im ar chos to illust the effect and divers of the propos techn
the fpa perform is comp with the k-means a popul clust algorithm and metah algorithm nam the genet algorithm partic swarm optim cuckoo search spid monkey optim grey wolf optim diff evolv harmony search and bat algorithm
the result ar evalu bas on class er perc cep tim complex and stat sign
fpa has the lowest cep for al four dataset and an av cep of 28% which is 5.5% low than next best algorithm in that sens
the fpa is the second quickest algorithm to converg aft hs algorithm
fpa also show a high level of stat sign
theref the obtain result show that the fpa efficy clust the dat and perform bet than the state-of-the-art method .
