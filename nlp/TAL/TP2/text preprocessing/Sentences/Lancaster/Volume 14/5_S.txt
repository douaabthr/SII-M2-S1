uid a un intrud detect system for iot environ
intrud detect system id us machin learn approach is get popul as it has an adv of get upd by itself to defend against any new typ of attack
anoth emerg technolog cal internet of thing iot is tak the respons to mak autom system by commun the dev without hum interv
in iot bas system the wireless commun between sev dev through the internet caus vuln for diff sec threats
thi pap propos a novel un intrud detect system for iot environ uid to defend the network from four typ of attack such as exploit dos prob and gen
the system is also abl to detect norm categ of network traff
most of the rel work on id ar bas on kdd99 or nsl-kdd 99 dat set which ar un to detect new typ of attack
in thi pap unsw-nb15 dat set is consid as the benchmark dataset to design uid for detect malicy act in the network
the perform analys prov that the attack detect rat of the propos model is high comp to two ex approach enad and dendron which also work on unsw-nb15 dat set .
