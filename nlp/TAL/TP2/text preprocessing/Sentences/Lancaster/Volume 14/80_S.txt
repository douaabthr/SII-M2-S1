a review of genetic-based evolv algorithm in svm paramet optim
paramet optim is a research hotspot of svm and has gain increas interest from vary research field
comp with oth optim algorithm genetic-based evolv algorithm that hav achiev optim accord to the law of sep and fre combin in genet ar grad attract much at
also due to the charact of self-organization and self-adaptation thes algorithm oft en svm to obtain appropry paramet so that the model can be apply to mor apply
addit many improv hav been propos in the past two decad in ord to allow the optim svm model to obtain bet perform
thi work focus on review the cur stat of genetic-based evolv algorithm us to optim paramet of svm and it vary
first we introduc the principl of svm and provid a survey on optim method of it paramet
then we propos a taxonom of improv genetic-based evolv algorithm accord to cod mech paramet control pop structure evolv strategy op mech op and many oth hybrid approach
furtherm thi pap analys and comp the adv and disadv of the abov algorithm explicit and provid their appl scenario as wel
fin we highlight the ex problem of genetic-based evolv algorithm us for paramet optim of svm and prospect develop trend of thi field in the fut .
