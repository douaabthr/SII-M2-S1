an efficy nucle seg method bas on roulet wheel whal optim and fuzzy clust
im seg is a techn in which an im is partit into diff categ or reg that correspond to object or part of object
the perform of seg method is gen reduc for the hematoxylin and eosin stain histopatholog im due to complex background and vary intens valu
theref in thi pap the roulet wheel select whal optim bas fuzzy clust method is introduc for the nucle seg of histopatholog im
the propos clust method find the optim clust us the object funct that reduc the sum of squ er or compact
the perform of the propos clust method has been examin on the histopatholog im dataset of triple-negativ breast cant paty and comp with k-means and fuzzy c-means in respect of f1 scor and aggreg jaccard index
the propos method attain 0.6701 mean f1 scor and 0.7387 mean aggreg jaccard index valu which ar the best valu among oth method
the expery outcom valid the efficy of the introduc method ov the oth clustering-based seg method .
