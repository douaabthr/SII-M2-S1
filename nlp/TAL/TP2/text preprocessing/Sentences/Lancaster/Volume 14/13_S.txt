hyper-paramet tun deep q network for are estim of oil spil a meta-heuristic approach
oil spil near shorelin ar a maj environ hazard
rapid estim of spil perimet provid a quick estim of it are ext thu facilit it quick remov
in thi study a meta-heuristic algorithm gamma-levy hybrid meta-heuristic with condit evolv glhm-ce is propos
the propos algorithm is then us to evolv a distribut control strategy for a swarm of unman aer vehic for rapid confin and estim of spil perimet
every ag is control by a deep q network whos hyper-parameters ar tun by glhm-ce
evalu of glhm-ce ov 28 blackbox problem of cec-2013 spec sess on real-parameter optim and it comparison with evolv algorithm lik shad co-de and jad rev that glhm-ce success evad loc minim and has a fast converg
the effect in hyper-paramet tun of a deep q network by glhm-ce was evalu ov the quintess cartpol problem from opena gym framework .
