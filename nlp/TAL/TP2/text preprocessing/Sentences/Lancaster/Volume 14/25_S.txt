partic swarm optim with adapt inert weight bas on cum binom prob
partic swarm optim pso is a pop ory heur num optim algorithm influ by the combin behavy of som bird
sint it introduc in 1995 a larg numb of vary of pso algorithm hav been introduc that improv it perform
the perform of the algorithm most rely upon inert weight and optim paramet set
inert weight bring equ among exploit and expl whil search optim solv within the search reg
thi pap pres a new improv vert of pso that us adapt inert weight techn which is bas on cum binom prob cbppso
the propos approach along with four oth pso vary ar test ov a set of ten well-known optim test problem
the result confirm that the perform of propos algorithm cbppso is bet than oth pso vary in most of the cas
also the propos algorithm has been evalu on three real-world engin problem and the result obtain ar prom .
