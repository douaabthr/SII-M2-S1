mc/dc guid test sequ priorit us firef algorithm
optim of the regress test process has been play an import rol in develop qual softw
stil it is difficult to achiev satisfact result on the gen of non-redundant and optim test sequ
ther ar many optim techn apply to regress test
firef algorithm fa has gain it popul as an optim techn to provid bet solv in the area of sci and engin
but the origin fa nee to hav a bet or mod object funct
thi work us fa with an improv object funct to gen optim test path guid by mod condition/decij cov mc/dc criter in the form of a guid matrix
thi matrix is built with mc/dc influ valu that we obtain from the pred nod of control flow graph cfg
thi guid matrix also help in meas the fault-finding pot of a nod
it also help in rout firef to mov between the nod of a cfg
we hav chos mc/dc criter as it is the second strongest cod cov criter due to it linear tim complex
then fa is us by defin an appropry object funct to travers the graph us firef
we obtain optim test sequ aft execut the fa
thes test sequ ar rank by comput the mean bright of nod along a path and then priorit bas on their rank
our sim and comparison ar valid by expery on sev mod siz jav program .
