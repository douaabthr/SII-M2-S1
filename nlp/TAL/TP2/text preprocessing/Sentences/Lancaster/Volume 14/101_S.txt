dnav an algorithm bas on dna-computing and vortex search algorithm for task scheduling problem
in thi pap we pres dnav algorithm for the gen job-shop scheduling problem also known as flex jssp
jssp is an np-complete problem which mean ther is prob no determin or exact algorithm that can find the optim solv in polynom tim for arbit inst of the problem unless p np
in the dna comput algorithm although the hardw is not access in the fut we wil hav thos comput that work bas on biolog hardw
their most import adv ov silicon-based comput ar their capac for dat stor
dnav is an improv of the dna comput algorithm by us a metah search algorithm cal vortex search vs algorithm
the strongness of dna comput is it parallel
in the unavail of dna comput the dnav reduc the tim complex of dna comput by employ the vs algorithm
the efficy of the dnav has been test with standard test inst of job-shop scheduling problem
our impl result show that the dnav algorithm work effect ev for larg scal inst on cur silicon-based comput .
