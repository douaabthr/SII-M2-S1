a work load predict strategy for pow optim on cloud bas dat cent us deep machin learn
the apply develop industry has mov into cloud comput for stratifying the nee of the custom for high avail and high scal
the cloud comput environ provid the infrastruct off the prem for the apply own which reduc the nee for cost and sec aspect
the prim intend of the cloud-bas dat cent is to virt the infrastruct for the apply and pres it as infrastruct as a serv iaa
the deploy of the apply from the apply own is don on the dat cent and must be alloc to any of the pre-configured inst
the inst ar again config with virt machin for virt the comput cap mem cap network bandwid cap and fin the stor cap
the deploy apply on the virt machin must be access by the apply consum or the cli of the apply own
load bal typ includ commit program or equip for exampl a multilay switch or a domain nam system serv process
ont the load is bal then the apply perform can be just
gre numb of research endeav hav endeav to build the pres of the apply dur load bal by send diff calc for distinct proof of the load virt machin and less load cas for determin of the goal serv
nevertheless the perform of thes strategies for load bal is alway crit by vary research attempt for being high tim complex and direct effect the overal perform
extraordin numb of research tri hav attempt to construct the introduc of the apply dur load bal by send vary estim for recogn ver of the load virt machin and less load cas for ass of the object serv
the outcom from thi research is high satisfact and demonst near 98% acc on the load predict and near 85% reduc on the tim complex with 88% reduc on the sla viol .
