autom fac retriev us bag-of-features and sigmoid grey wolf optim
a cont bas im retriev system is on of the prim research field due to the expon increas of multimed dat ov internet espec im
although a numb of cont bas im retriev method hav been introduc it is stil a challeng task spec for fac recognit
theref thi work pres an autom fac retriev system us an enh bag-of-features framework
the bag-of-features framework has been mod by incorp a new sigmoid grey wolf optim algorithm
the sigmoid grey wolf optim algorithm us a sigmoid decreas funct to escap it from loc optim
the efficy of the propos sigmoid grey wolf optim algorithm has been analys ov vary standard benchmark funct for av fit valu and converg behavy
furtherm it has success been us to gen the codeword in bag-of-features framework
the mod bag-of-features has been util in cont bas im retriev for orac research lab orl fac databas
the sim result repres that the propos method effect retriev the fac as comp to oth nature-inspired bas method .
