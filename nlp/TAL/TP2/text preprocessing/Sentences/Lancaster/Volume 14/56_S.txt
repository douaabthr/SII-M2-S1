hybrid encrypt framework for sec big dat stor in multi-cloud environ
in the pres scenario big dat is fac many challeng regard the dat stor dat theft and unauth access
many research ar cont on develop the sec mech for big dat stor
to overcom the abov issu thi pap cont on develop the encrypt algorithm for stor big dat in the mult cloud stor
the mult cloud stor environ permit the us to stor the dat in to diff cloud stor serv
thi pap aim to develop the sec framework which restrict the insid attack
the propos framework contain dat upload slic index encrypt distribut decrypt retriev and merg process
the hybrid encrypt algorithm was develop to provid the sec to the big dat bef stor it in to the mult cloud
the sim analys is carry with real tim cloud stor environ
the propos algorithm record around 2630 kb/s for the encrypt process
the result prov the supery of the propos algorithm comp to the bench mark algorithm .
