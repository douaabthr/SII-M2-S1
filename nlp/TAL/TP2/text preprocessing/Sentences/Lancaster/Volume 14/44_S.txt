develop and perform evalu of hybrid kelm model for forecast of agro-commodity pric
incur the benefit of kernel type-based extrem learn machin kelm thi pap propos a grey wolf optim bas multiquadr kernel kelm gwo-kelm model for effect forecast of agro-commodity pric such as chan and barley
the object is to obtain best poss weight between hid and output lay of an art neur network us gwo optim techn
thes weight ar us in kelm model to achiev improv perform
to assess the supery perform of the propos model simil result ar obtain us sim study by sim ga-kelm genet algorithm bas kelm pso-kelm partic swarm optim bas kelm and gwo-kelm multiquadr kernel typ gwo-kelm model
from exhaust sim result it is demonst that gwo-kelm forecast model off the best perform us three model in term of mat
the study pertain to short and long rang predict for pric of chan and barley us publ avail databas .
