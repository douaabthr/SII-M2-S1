predict bipol disord and schizophrenia bas on non-overlapping genet phenotyp us deep neur network
comput psychiatry is an emerg field of sci
it focus on ident the complex rel between the brain s neurobiolog
ment il has rec becom an import problem to be address as the numb of peopl affect is increas ov tim
schizophrenia and bipol disord ar two maj typ of psychy disord
most of the peopl ar expery thes il in their lifetim
but diagnos psychy disord is ev mor a complex problem
genet fact play a vit rol in develop ment il
interest few psychy disord hav common genet overlap between each oth
it caus detry effect on diagnos the il acc
to overcom thi ex issu a rank bas gen biomark id and class framework is propos to ident the overlap and non-overlapping gen pattern of bipol disord and schizophrenia
the dataset us in thi expery is obtain from gen express omnib databas
as an outcom of thi expery sev biomark ar ident as the overlap gen
also 60 and 68 inform gen biomark ar ident on bipol disord and schizophrenia dataset as feat subset to discrimin the sampl
overlap gen ar elimin to increas the diagnost acc of the disord
the perform of the propos system is evalu with standard ex machin learn algorithm
thi propos framework attain 97.01% and 95.65% acc on bipol disord and schizophrenia dataset with deep neur network model outperform oth benchmark algorithm and prov it eff .
