hybrid ant lion with whal optim algorithm for compress sens mr im reconstruct vial1minimization an alwo strategy
in the field of im compress the compress sens im reconstruct has mad gre achiev due to prop us of the im spars without the nyqu sampl law constraint
for im inform distribut gre deal of research ind that ther ex obvy structural and stat pri s regul and by the tradit compress algorithm it is difficult to achiev
in thi pap we propos a compress sens im reconstruct algorithm bas on hybrid alwo strategy which combin the ant lion optim algorithm and the whal optim algorithm
the hybrid algorithm produc a glob search with fast converg
by continu learn the propos hybrid method can find optim solv
the object funct for the im reconstruct process is tak as thel1minimization problem
the reconstruct im is obtain by solv thel1minimization problem
extend sim hav been conduc and the result show that the propos method has achiev bet perform when comp with tradit reconstruct algorithm .
