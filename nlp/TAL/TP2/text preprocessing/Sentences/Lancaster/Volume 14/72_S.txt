an im seg method us logarithmickbestgravit search algorithm bas superpixel clust
im seg partit an im into coh and non-overlapping reg
due to vary of vis pattern in im it is a challeng problem
thi pap introduc a new superpixel-based clust method to efficy perform the im seg
in the propos method init superpixel from an im ar obtain
the superpixel ar furth clust into the requir numb of reg by a new propos vary of gravit search algorithm nam logarithmickbestgravit search algorithm
expery ar conduc on the berkeley seg dataset and benchmark bsds500
it is affirm from both vis and num analys that the propos method is eff and acc in seg an im than the oth consid seg method .
