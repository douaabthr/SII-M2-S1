mesh smooth of complex geometry us vary of cohort intellig algorithm
sev approach includ optim bas method wer develop for mesh qual improv us on nod mov keep intact the el connect
in thi research a socio-inspired optim approach refer to as cohort intellig ci was investig for mesh smooth
minim of sum of condit numb of al el was the fin aim
the geomet bound of the object defin the surfac and edg constraint for mov of extern nod
mov of intern nod was complet govern by vary of ci algorithm viz
roulet wheel follow best follow bet aly and random select follow worst and follow itself
the approach was demonst with pentagon prism hexagon prism and hexagon prism with hol
the perform of follow best and roulet wheel vary of ci algorithm was observ to be satisfact as comp to oth vary of the algorithm .
