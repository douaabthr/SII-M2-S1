hybrid approach bas on cuckoo optim algorithm and genet algorithm for task scheduling
on of the most import issu in design efficy scheduling algorithm in heterog distribut system is the reduc of execut tim
in the propos algorithm the mod op of the cuckoo optim algorithm and the genet algorithm ar us to achiev a rel optim solv with few repetit of the genet algorithm and less execut tim than the cuckoo optim algorithm
the most import innov in the propos algorithm is the introduc of a new op cal spir search which increas the vary among the sampl produc in each gen
the main ide of thi op is to replac linear search with the spir search which allow loc search between simil schedules and accel the achiev of a rel optim answ
also the mult object funct in the propos algorithm is us to minim makesp and maxim parallel
the result obtain from the propos algorithm on a larg numb of standard graph with a vary rang of attribut show that it is supery to the oth task scheduling algorithm .
