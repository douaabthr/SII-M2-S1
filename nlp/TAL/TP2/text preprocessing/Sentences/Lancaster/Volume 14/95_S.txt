investig the us of an ensembl of evolv algorithm for let id in trem mediev handwrit
ensembl class ar known for perform good gen from simpl and less acc class
ensembl hav the abl to us the vary in class pattern of the smal class in ord to mak bet predict
howev to cre an ensembl it is necess to determin how the compon class should be combin to gen the fin predict
on way to do thi is to search diff combin of class with evolv algorithm which ar larg employ when the object is to find a structure that serv for som purpos
in thi work an investig is carry about the us of ensembl obtain via evolv algorithm for ident individ let in trem mediev writ and to differenty between scribes
the aim of thi research is to us thi process as the first step toward class the trem typ with mor acc
the ensembl ar obtain through evolv search of tre that aggreg the output of bas class which ar neur network train pri to the ensembl search
the misclass pattern of the bas class ar analys in ord to determin how much bet an ensembl of thos class can be than it compon
the best ensembl hav their misclass pattern comp to thos of their compon class
the result obtain suggest interest method for let up to 96% acc and us class up to 88% acc in an offlin scenario .
