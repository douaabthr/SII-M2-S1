a deep contract autoencod for solv multiclass class problem
contract auto encod cae is on of the most robust vary of standard auto encod ae
the maj drawback assocy with the conv cae is it high reconstruct er dur encod and decod process of input feat to the network
thi drawback in the op proc of cae lead to it incap of going into fin detail pres in the input feat by miss the inform wor consid
result the feat extract by cae lack the tru repres of al the input feat and the class fail in solv class problem efficy
in thi work an improv vary of cae is propos bas on lay architect follow fee forward mech nam as deep cae
in the propos architect the norm cae ar arrang in lay and insid each lay the process of encod and decod tak plac
the feat obtain from the prevy cae ar giv as input to the next cae
each cae in al lay ar respons for reduc the reconstruct er thu result in obtain the inform feat
the feat set obtain from the last cae is giv as input to the softmax class for class
the perform and efficy of the propos model has been test on fiv mnist variant-datasets
the result hav been comp with standard sae dae rbm sca scatnet and pcanet in term of train er test er and execut tim
the result rev that the propos model outperform the af model .
