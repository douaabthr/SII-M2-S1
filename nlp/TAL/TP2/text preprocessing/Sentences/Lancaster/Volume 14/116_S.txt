num solv of bagley torvik equ us legendr art neur network method
in thi artic we hav us the legendr art neur network to find the solv of the bagley torvik equ which is a fractional-order ordin diff equ
caputo fract der has been consid throughout the pres work to handl the fract ord diff equ
the train of optim weight of the network has been carry out us a sim an optim techn
her we hav pres three exampl to exhibit the precid and relev of the propos techn with comparison to the oth num method with er analys
the propos techn is an easy high efficy and robust techn for find the approxim solv of fractional-order ordin diff equ .
