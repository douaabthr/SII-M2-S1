delug bas genet algorithm for feat select
feat select method ar us to ident and remov irrelev and redund attribut from the origin feat vect that do not hav much contribut to enh the perform of a predict model
meta-heuristic feat select algorithm us as a solv to thi problem nee to hav a good trade-off between exploit and expl of the search spac
genet algorithm ga a popul meta-heuristic algorithm lack exploit cap which in turn affect the loc search abl of the algorithm
bas ga us mut op to tak car of exploit which has certain limit
as a result ga get stuck in loc optim
to encount thi problem in the pres work we hav intellig blend the gre delug algorithm gda a loc search algorithm with ga
her gda is us in plac of mut op of the ga
apply of gda yield a high degr of exploit through the us of perturb of candid solv
the propos method is nam as delug bas genet algorithm dga
we hav apply the dga on 15 publ avail standard dataset tak from the uc dataset reposit
to show the class independ nat of the propos feat select method we hav us 3 diff class nam k-nearest neighbo knn multi-layer perceptron mlp and support vect machin svm
comparison of dga has been perform with oth contemp algorithm lik the bas vert of ga partic swarm optim pso sim an sa and histogram bas multi-objective ga hmog
from the comparison result it has been observ that dga perform much bet than oth in most of the cas
thu our main contribut in thi pap ar introduc of a new vary of ga for fs which us gda to strengthen it exploit abl and apply of the propos method on 15 well-known uc dataset us knn mlp and svm class .
