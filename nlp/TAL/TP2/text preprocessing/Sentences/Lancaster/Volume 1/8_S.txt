the dca som comparison
the dendrit cel algorithm dca is an immune-inspired algorithm develop for the purpos of anoma detect
the algorithm perform multi-sensor dat fus and correl which result in a context aw detect system
prevy apply of the dca hav includ the detect of pot malicy port scan act wher it has produc high rat of tru posit and low rat of fals posit
in thi work we aim to comp the perform of the dca and of a self-organizing map som when apply to the detect of syn port scan through expery analys
a som is an id candid for comparison as it shar simil with the dca in term of the dat fus method employ
it is shown that the result of the two system ar comp and both produc fals posit for the sam process
thi show that the dca can produc anoma detect result to the sam standard as an est techn .
