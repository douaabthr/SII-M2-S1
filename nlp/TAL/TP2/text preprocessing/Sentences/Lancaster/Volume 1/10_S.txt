evolv algorithm to sim the phylogenes of a bin art immun system
four binary-encoded model describ som aspect of the phylogenet evolv in an art immun system hav been propos and analys
the first model has focus on the evolv of a paratop s pop consid a fix group of epitop to sim a hypermut mech and observ how the system would self-adjust to cov the epitop
in the second model the evolv involv a group of antibody adapt to a giv antig molec pop
the third model sim the coevolv between antibody gen gen libr and antig
the object was to sim som recombin mech to obtain fin libr apt to produc antibody to cov any poss antig that would appear in the pathog pop
in the four model the coevolv involv a new pop of self-molecules whos funct was to est restrict in the evolv of libr pop
for al the model impl evolv algorithm ea wer us to form adapt nich inspir in the coevolv shar nich strategy idea tak from a monopol competit econom model wher businessm loc themselv among geograph distribut cli so as to maxim their profit
num expery and conclud ar shown
thes consid pres many simil to biolog immun system and also som inspir to solv real-world problem such as pattern recognit and knowledg discovery in databas .
