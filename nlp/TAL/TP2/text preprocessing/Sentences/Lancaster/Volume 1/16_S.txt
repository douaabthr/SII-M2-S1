evolv of intern dynam for neur network nod
most art neur network hav nod that apply a simpl stat transf funct such as a sigmoid or gauss to their accum input
thi contrast with biolog neuron whos transf funct ar dynam and driv by a rich intern structure
our art neur network approach which we callstate-enhanced neur network us nod with dynam transf funct bas onn-dimensional real-valued intern stat
thi intern stat provid the nod with mem of past input and comput
the stat upd rul which determin the intern dynam of a nod ar optim by an evolv algorithm to fit a particul task and environ
we demonst the effect of the approach in comparison to certain typ of recur neur network us a suit of part observ markov decid process as test problem
thes problem involv both sequ detect and sim mic in maz and includ four adv benchmark propos by oth research .
