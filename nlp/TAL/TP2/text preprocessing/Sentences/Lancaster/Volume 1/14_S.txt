men a modul regul and hierarch encod for neural-networks bas on attribut gramm
rec work in the evolv comput field suggest that the impl of the principl of modul funct loc of funct repetit multipl us of the sam sub-structure and hierarchy recurs composit of sub-structures could improv the evolv of complex system
the gen of neur network through evolv algorithm should in particul benefit from an adapt us of thes not
we hav consequ develop modul encod for neur network bas on attribut gramm men a new encod design to gen the structure of neur network and paramet with evolv algorithm whil explicit en thes three above-mentioned principl
we express thi encod in the form of attribut gramm in ord to facilit understand and fut mod
it has been test on two prelimin benchmark problem cart-pole control and robot arm control the lat being spec design to evalu the repetit cap of an encod
we comp men to a direct encod modnet neat a multi-layer perceptron with a fix structure and to ref control
result show that men perform bet than comp encod on both problem suggest a prom pot for fut apply .
