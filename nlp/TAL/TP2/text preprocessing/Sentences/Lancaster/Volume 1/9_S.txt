improv the rely of real-time embed system us in immun techn
prevy work has shown that immune-inspired techn hav good pot for solv problem assocy with the develop of real-time embed system rte wher for vary reason tradit real-time develop techn ar not suit
thi pap examin in mor detail the gen appl of the dendrit cel algorithm dca to the problem of task scheduling in rte
to mak thi poss an understand of the problem charact is form such that the result produc by the dca can be examin in rel to the overal problem difficul
the pap then contain a detail understand of how wel the dca which demonst that it gen perform wel howev it clear ident property of anoma that ar difficult to detect
thes property ar as anticip bas on real-time scheduling the .
