a parallel immun optim algorithm for num funct optim
immun optim algorithm show good perform in obtain optim solv espec in deal with num optim problem wher such solv ar oft difficult to determin by tradit techn
thi artic pres the parallel suppress control algorithm psca a parallel algorithm for optim bas on art immun system ai
psca is impl in a parallel platform wher the correspond pop of antibody is partit into subpop that ar distribut among the process
each process execut the immunity-based algorithm for optim it subpop
in the process of evolv the solv the act of antibody and the act of the comput ag ar reg by the gen suppress control framework gscf which maintain and control the interact between the pop and process
the propos algorithm is evalu with benchmark problem and it perform is meas and comp with oth conv optim approach .
