frequ analys for dendrit cel pop tun
the dendrit cel algorithm dca has been apply success to a divers rang of apply
thes apply ar rel by the inh uncertainty assocy with sens the apply environ
the dca has perform wel us unfilt sign from each environ as input
in thi pap we demonst that the dca has an emerg filt mech caus by the man in which the cel accum it intern vary
furtherm we demonst a rel between the migr threshold of the cel and the transf funct of the algorithm
a tun methodolog is propos and a robot apply publ prevy is revisit us the new tun techn .
