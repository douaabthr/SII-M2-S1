genetic-based machin learn system ar competit for pattern recognit
dur the last decad research ongenetic-based machin learningha result in sev propos of superv learn methodolog that useevolv algorithmsto evolv rule-based class model
us thes new gbml approach ar accompany by littl expery and ther is a lack of comparison among diff propos
besid the competit of gbml system with respect to non-evolutionary highly-used machin learn techn has on been part study
thi pap review the stat of the art in gbml select som of the best repres of diff famy and comp the acc and the interpret of their model
the pap also analys the behavy of the gbml approach with respect to som of the most influ machin learn techn that belong to diff learn paradigm such as decid tre support vect machin instance-based class and prob class
the expery observ emphas the suit of gbml system for perform class task
moreov the analys point out the strengths of the diff system which can be us as recommend guidelin on which system should be employ depend on wheth the us pref to maxim the acc or the interpret of the model .
