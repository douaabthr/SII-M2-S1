self org class first step in structured evolv machin learn
learn class system lcss ar evolv machin learn algorithm flex enough to be apply to reinforc superv and unsuperv learn problem with good perform
rec self org class wer propos which ar simil to lcss but hav the adv that in it structured pop no bal between nich and fit press is necess
howev mor test and analys ar requir to ver it benefit
her a vary of the first algorithm is propos which us a parameterless self org map som
thi algorithm is apply in challeng problem such as big noisy as wel as dynam chang continu input-action maz grow and compress maz ar includ with good perform
moreov a genet op is propos which util the topolog inform of the som s pop structure improv the result
thu the first step in structured evolv machin learn ar shown nonetheless the problem fac ar mor difficult than the state-of-art continu input-action multi-step on .
