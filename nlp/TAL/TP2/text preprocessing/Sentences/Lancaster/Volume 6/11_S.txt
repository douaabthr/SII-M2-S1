improv thresholding bas on neg select algorithm nsa
thresholding is a tool of im seg which group the pixel in a log way
in thi pap a novel algorithm bas on neg select algorithm a model of art immun system is propos for im thresholding
the propos algorithm is apply on the thresholded im of lath tool produc us maxim inform entrop mie and glob thresholding bas techn result in an improv im
to ver the algorithm and result it has also been apply on som of the inbuilt matlab matrix lab im
histogram is employ to analys the result
furth the result of improv algorithm ar comp with the result of mie and the glob thresholding method to check the effect of the propos method
the expery result confirm the pot of the develop algorithm .
