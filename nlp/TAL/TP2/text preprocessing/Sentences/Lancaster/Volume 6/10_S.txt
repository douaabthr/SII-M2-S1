a fast anoma detect system us prob art immun algorithm cap of learn new attack
in thi pap we propos anoma bas intrud detect algorithm in comput network us art immun system cap of learn new attack
un charact and observ spec to comput network ar consid in develop fast algorithm whil achiev high perform
although thes charact play a key rol in the propos algorithm we believ they hav been neglect in the prevy rel work
we evalu the propos algorithm on a numb of well-known intrud detect dataset as wel as two new real dataset extract from the dat network for intrud detect
we analys the detect perform and learn cap of the propos algorithm in addit to perform criter such as fals alarm rat detect rat and respons tim
the expery result demonst that the propos algorithm exhibit fast respons tim low fals alarm rat and high detect rat
they can also learn new attack pattern and ident them the next tim they ar introduc to the network .
