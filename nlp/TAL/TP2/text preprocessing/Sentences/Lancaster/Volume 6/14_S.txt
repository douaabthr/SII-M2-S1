method for approxim valu funct for the domin card gam
art neur network hav been success us to approxim valu funct for task involv decid mak
in domain wher decid requir a shift in judg as the overal stat chang it is hypothes her that method util multipl art neur network ar lik to provid a benefit as an approxim of a valu funct ov thos that employ a singl network
the card gam domin was chos as the domain to examin thi
thi pap comp art neur network gen by multipl machin learn method success apply to oth gam such as in td-gammon to a genet algorithm method for gen two neur network for diff phas of the gam along with evolv the transit point
the result demonst a gre success ratio with the genet algorithm apply to two neur network
thi suggest that fut work examin mor complex neur network config and rich evolv expl could apply to domin as wel as oth domain necessit shift in strategy .
