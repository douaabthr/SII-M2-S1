on evolv subspac clust with symbios
subspac clust ident the attribut support for each clust as wel as ident the loc and numb of clust
in the most gen cas attribut assocy with each clust could be un
a multi-objective evolv method is propos to ident the un attribut support of each clust whil detect it dat inst
the propos algorithm symbiot evolv subspac clust s-esc borrow from symbios in the sens that each clust solv is defin in term of a host singl memb of the host pop and a numb of coevolv clust centroid or symbiont in an independ symbiont pop
symbiont defin clust and theref attribut subspac wherea host defin set of clust to constitut a non-degenerate solv
the symbiot repres of s-esc is the key to mak it scal to high-dimensional dataset whil an integr subsampl process mak it scal to task with a larg numb of dat item
benchmark is perform against a test suit of 59 subspac clust task with four wel known comp algorithm from both the full-dimension and subspac clust lit em minecl procl statpc
perform of the s-esc algorithm was found to be robust across a wid cross-section of property with a common paramet util throughout
thi was not the cas for the comp algorithm
spec perform could be sensit to the particul dat distribut or paramet sweep might be necess to provid comp perform
an addit evalu is perform against a non-symbiotic ga with s-esc stil return supery clust solv .
