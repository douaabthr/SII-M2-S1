perform analys of rough set ensembl of learn class system with diff evolv bas rul discovery
dat min and spec superv dat class is a key apply are for learn class system lcs
scal to larg class problem espec to high dimend problem is a key challeng
ensembl bas approach can be apply to lcs to address scal issu
to thi end a rough set bas ensembl of lcs is propos which rely on a pre-processed feat partit step to train multipl lcs on feat subspac
each bas class in the ensembl is a michig styl superv lcs
the tradit genet algorithm bas rul evolv is replac by a diff evolv bas rul discovery to improv gen cap of lcs
a vot mech is then us to gen output for test inst
thi pap describ the propos ensembl algorithm in detail and comp it perform with diff vert of bas lcs on a numb of benchmark class task
analys of comput tim and model acc show the rel merit of the ensembl algorithm and bas class on the test dat set
the rough set bas ensembl learn approach and diff evolv bas rul search out-perform the bas lcs on class acc ov the dat set consid
result also show that smal ensembl siz is sufficy to obtain good perform .
