composit of web serv through genet program
web serv ar interfac that describ a collect of op that ar network-accessible through standard web protocol
when a requir op is not found sev serv can be compound to get a composit serv that perform the desir task
to find thi composit serv a search process in a gen hug search spac must be perform
the algorithm that compos the serv must select the adequ atom process and also must choos the correct way to combin them us the diff avail control structures
in thi pap a genet program algorithm for web serv composit is pres
the algorithm has a context-free gramm to gen the valid structures of the composit serv and also it includ a method to upd the attribut of each nod
moreov the propos tri to minim the numb of serv and look for composit with the minim execut path
a ful expery valid with four diff reposit with up to 1,090 web serv has been don show a gre perform in al the test as the algorithm find a valid solv with a short execut path .
