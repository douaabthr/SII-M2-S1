real-world transf of evolv art immun system behavio between smal and larg scal robot platform
in mobl robot a solid test for adapt is the abl of a control system to funct not on in a divers numb of phys environ but also on a numb of diff robot platform
thi pap demonst that a set of behavio evolv in sim on a miny robot epuck can be transfer to a much larger-scale platform pion both in sim and in the real world
the chos architect us art evolv of epuck behavio to obtain a genet sequ which is then employ to see an idiotyp art immun system ai on the pion
despit num hardw and softw diff between the platform navig and target-finding expery show that the evolv behavio transf very wel to the larg robot when the idiotyp ai techn is us
in contrast transf is poor when reinforc learn alon is us which valid the adapt of the chos architect .
