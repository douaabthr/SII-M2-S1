gpu impl of a road sign detect bas on partic swarm optim
road sign detect is a maj goal of the adv driv assist system
most publ work on thi problem shar the sam approach by which sign ar first detect and then class in video sequ ev if diff techn ar us
whil detect is us perform us class comput vis techn bas on col and/or shap match most oft class is perform by neur network
in thi work we pres a novel modul and scal approach to road sign detect bas on partic swarm optim which tak into account both shap and col to detect sign
in our approach in particul the optim of a singl fit funct allow both to detect a sign belong to a certain categ and at the sam tim to estim it posit with respect to the camer ref fram
to spee up process the algorithm impl exploit the parallel comput cap off by modern graph card and in particul by the comput un dev architect by nvid
the effect of the approach has been assess on both synthet and real video sequ which hav been success process at or clos to ful fram rat .
