recombin op and select strategies for evolv markov chain mont carlo algorithm
markov chain mont carlo mcmc method ar oft us to sampl from intract target distribut
som mcmc vary aim to improv the perform by run a pop of mcmc chain
in thi pap we investig the us of techn from evolv comput ec to design population-based mcmc algorithm that exchang us inform between the individ chain
we investig how on can ens that the result class of algorithm calledevolv mcmc emcmc sampl from the target distribut as expect from any mcmc algorithm
we analys and expery show us exampl from discret search spac that the propos emcmc can outperform standard mcmcs by exploit common part structures between the mor lik individ stat
the mcmc chain in the pop interact through recombin and select
we analys the requir property of recombin op and acceiv or select rul in emcmc
an import issu is how to preserv the detail bal property which is a sufficy condit for an irreduc and aperiod emcmc to converg to a giv target distribut
transfer ec techn to population-based mcmcs should be don with car
for inst we prov that emcmc algorithm with an elit acceiv rul do not sampl the target distribut correct .
