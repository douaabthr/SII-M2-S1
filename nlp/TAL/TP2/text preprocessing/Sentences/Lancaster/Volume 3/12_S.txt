memet pareto diff evolv art neur network to determin grow multi-classes in predict microbiolog
the main object of thi research is to autom design art neur network model with sigmoid bas unit for multiclass task in predict microbiolog
the class obtain achiev a doubl object a high class level in the dataset and high class level for each class
the memet pareto diff evolv neur network chos to learn the structure and weight of the neur network is a diff evolv approach bas on the pareto diff evolv multiobject evolv algorithm
the pareto diff evolv algorithm is aug with a loc search us the improv resy backprop with backtrack irprop algorithm
to analys the robust of thi methodolog it has been apply to two complex class problem in predict microbiolog staphylococc aureusandshigell flexner
the result obtain show that the gen abl and the class rat in each class can be mor efficy improv within thi multiobject algorithm .
