a nearest neighb query method for search object with tim and loc inform bas on spatiotemp simil
it is cruc for us to find lot of inform with tim and geograph tag on the internet
theref a nearest neighb query method cal str-knn is propos
us the method of calc the spatiotemp simil between two object the spatiotemp vary of the dat object ar norm and map to the three-dimensional spac
the dist simil between two dat object in the three-dimensional spac is us to approxim their act spatiotemp simil
in thi way a three-dimensional str-tree index is built for the dat object in the three-dimensional spac
thi index can effect combin the spat temp vary of the dat object ens that each dat object is travers no mor than ont dur query process
fin an acc search algorithm of str-knn is design to find up to the top-k query result through a singl calc
in the expery when the dat volum is 6 mil the query tim of str-knn 3dr k nn and rt-k nn algorithm ar 12 ms 43 ms and 55 ms respect
when k is tak as 50 the query tim of the three algorithm ar 12 ms 43 ms and 55 ms respect ind that the new algorithm can gre improv the query efficy .
