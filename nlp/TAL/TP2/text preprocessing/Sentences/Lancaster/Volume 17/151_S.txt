modsw a new act funct for neur network
the act funct ar extrem import to neur network sint they ar respons for learn the abstract charact of the dat through nonlinear mod
the pap pres a new act funct which is refer to as modsw
it is continu differenty unbound abov bound below and non-monotonic
our result demonst that modsw outperform relu on a numb of challeng dataset and neur network model
in the begin of the expery neur network ar train and class us benchmark dat lik diagnost wisconsin breast cant and ir and modsw achiev 93.57% and 95.56% acc respect
second expery wer conduc on fiv distinct neur network depth that rang from fiv to eight lay ov mnist dataset
the modsw act funct obtain 95.57% 95.29% 94.93% 94.69% and 95.03% acc on 8 lay 7 lay 6 lay 5 thin lay and wid 5 lay neur network respect
fin expery wer conduc on two distinct convolv neur network with two convolv lay and four convolv lay ov cifar-10 dataset
the modsw act funct obtain 60.04% and 69.22% acc on two convolv lay and four convolv lay model respect
stat feat meas demonst that modsw has the best mean acc lowest root mean squ er lowest standard devy lowest vary and lowest mean squ er
the study ind that modsw has fast converg comp to relu mak it a valu fact in deep learn
the result of the expery suggest that modsw can be a prom substitut for relu lead to bet perform in neur network model .
