random subspac ensembl for direct class high-dimensional incomplet dat
miss valu ar a common issu in many high-dimensional dataset but a maj of class algorithm requir complet dat
theref imput method ar us us to estim and fil miss valu with plaus valu bef us the class algorithm to learn class or us the learnt class to class unseen incomplet sampl
howev good imput method ar us comput intend on high-dimensional dataset becaus thes dataset not on hav a larg numb of feat but also oft suff from a larg numb of miss valu
anoth approach is to us decid tre algorithm which do not nee imput and can work direct with incomplet dat
howev us decid tre to class high-dimensional dat oft lead to larg class acc becaus of the curs of dimend
ensembl techn which build multipl class instead of a singl class hav been wid us to improv acc for decid tre
thi pap aim to investig diff ensembl method to find effect and efficy ensembl of decid tre for class with high-dimensional incomplet dat
expery result show that the random subspac method is the most acc ensembl
the random subspac method is also mor acc than oth class algorithm which nee to combin with imput when work with incomplet dat
moreov the random subspac method is much fast than the oth algorithm becaus it can direct work on incomplet dat so doe not hav to spend tim estim miss valu .
