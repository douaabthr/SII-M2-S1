many-objective optim of wireless sens network deploy
rec the efficy deploy of wireless sens network wsns has becom a lead field of research in wsn design optim
pract scenario rel to wsn deploy ar oft consid as optim model with multipl conflict object that ar simult enh
in the rel lit it had been shown that mov from mono-objective to multi-objective resolv of wsn deploy is benef
howev sint the deploy of real-world wsns encompass mor than three object a multi-objective optim may harm oth deploy criter that ar conflict with the already consid on
thu our aim is to go furth expl the model and the resolv of wsn deploy in a many-objective i.e. optim with mor than three object fash and espec exhibit it ad valu
in thi context we first propos a many-objective deploy model involv sev conflict object and then we solv it us an adapt of the decomposition-based evolv algorithm thet dea
the develop adapt is nam wsn thet dea and is valid through a detail expery study .
