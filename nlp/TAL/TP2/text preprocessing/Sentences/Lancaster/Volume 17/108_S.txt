multi-objective soc group optim for machin process
a multi-objective soc group optim mosgo is propos in thi study as a method for resolv problem with multipl object
the init step is to us an extern chronicle with a predetermin siz to stor the ex non-dominated pareto optim solv
follow that solv ar chos from thi reposit us a roulet wheel mech bas on the cov of solv to guid individ in the direct of prom reg of multi-objective search spac
the propos method is test on ten cec2009 multi-objective benchmark problem and it has been comp to two well-known meta-heuristics the multi-objective evolv algorithm bas on decomposit moea/d algorithm and the multi-objective partic swarm optim mopso algorithm
it is ess to the machin process to choos the optim machin paramet in ord to guar produc qual low machin cost boost produc and preserv resourc for sustain
hent mosgo a postery multi-objective optim method is us in thi study to tackl the multi-objective optim problem of three machin process includ turn wire-electric-discharg machin and las cut
the result of the mosgo algorithm ar comp with the result obtain us ga nsga-ii pso and it search method and ar found to be comp
her it has been observ that the mosgo algorithm achiev the pareto-optimal set of solv in a very less numb of funct evalu as comp to oth algorithm show a high converg spee
the pareto-optimal set of solv for each optim problem is obtain and report
thes pareto-optimal set of solv ar help for real produc system and wil aid the decision-maker in tumultu situ .
