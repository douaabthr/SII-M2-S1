cutting-edge technolog lik machin learn deep learn im process and sev sign process mech wer employ in the efficy diagnos of pd
in view of thi we pres a structured review of such techn
in the ongo research ov the past few year vary dataset wer gen to assess pd with the saly paramet of the voic sign acquir from healthy peopl and pd paty
also trem and gait dat wer collect by record the mov of pd paty from sens unit such as acceleromet gyroscop and inert meas unit sens
an overal analys has been don on the vary techn with respect to the voic dataset and mot sens dat
a detail analys suggest that machin and deep learn approach ar optim in develop clin apply .
