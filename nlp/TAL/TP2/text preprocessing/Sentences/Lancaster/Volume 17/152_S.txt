hybrid evolv grey wolf optim for constrain engin problem and multi-unit produc plan
a novel approach cal hybrid evolv gwo he-gwo is propos to enh the effect of the grey wolf optim gwo for handl dynam landscap
thi approach combin the strengths of the canon gwo with diff evolv de to achiev a high-level hybrid
he-gwo enh the leadership-based guid system and incorp an evolv dimend hunt system with pop subgroup to increas the divers of the wolfpack
dynam tun set ar spec dev to reg the bal between expl and exploit and to facilit the evolv of the wolfpack by increas it divers
the propos method is ver through rig benchmark test us three rec benchmark suit includ cec2020 cec2019 and the 100 digit competit as wel as the cec2021 benchmark suit
subsequ a comp analys is perform on fiv standard engin problem
the propos he-gwo is evalu against a tot of 23 meta-heuristics which includ the standard gwo eight adv and rec vary gwo ten rec meta-heuristics and four state-of-the-art adv meta-heuristics
addit the win of relev contest ar also includ in the comparison
furtherm the effect of the suggest approach is ver through eight inst of a multi-unit produc plan problem
thi problem consist of 270 decid vary includ 162 integ vary and 108 continu vary
the expery involv apply a combin of penal and constraint correct techn to handl the constraint
he-gwo has consist outperform state-of-the-art algorithm and competit win in benchmark achiev the highest profit in sev out of eight situ for the multi-unit produc plan problem .
