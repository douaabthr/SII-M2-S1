self a stacked-bas ensembl learn framework for breast cant class
nowaday breast cant is the most prev and jeopard diseas in wom aft lung cant
dur the past few decad a subst amount of cant cas hav been report throughout the world
breast cant has been a wid acknowledg categ of cant diseas in wom due to the lack of aw
accord to the world cant survey report 2020 about 2.3 mil cas and 685,000 death hav been report worldwid
as the patient-doctor ratio pdr is very high consequ ther is an utmost nee for a machine-based intellig breast cant diagnos system that can detect cant at it ear stag and cur it mor efficy
the plan is to assembl sci in both the rest and the machin learn field to progress toward thi clin apply
thi pap pres self a stacked-bas ensembl learn framework to class breast cant at an ear stag from the histopatholog im of tum cel with computer-aided diagnos tool
in thi work we us the breakh dataset with 7909 histopatholog im and wisconsin breast cant databas wbcd with 569 inst for the perform evalu of our propos framework
we hav train sev distinct class on both dataset and select the best fiv class on the bas of their acc meas to cre our ensembl model
we us the stack ensembl techn and consid the extr tre random forest adaboost grady boost and knn9 class as the bas learn and the log regress model as a fin estim
we hav evalu the perform of self on the breakh dataset and wbcd dataset and achiev test acc of approxim 95% and 99% respect
the result of the oth perform paramet on the breakh and the wbcd dataset also show that our propos framework outperform with f1-score roc and mcc scor .
