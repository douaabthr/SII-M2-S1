an optim method in wireless sens network rout and iot with wat strider algorithm and ant colony optim algorithm
a wireless sens network is a wireless commun network and each sens nod has sev sens to collect environ inform
wireless sens network nod hav limit energy resourc and nee optim rout protocol to reduc energy consum
fail to reduc energy consum by sens nod reduc network lif and efficy
the main problem in rout is find optim path for send packet by reduc energy consum in sens nod
thi pap propos an optim rout method to reduc energy consum in wireless sens network
in the first step wireless sens nod ar clust with the wat strider algorithm wsa and clust head ar select for rout
in the second step a mobl sink collect the packet from the clust head and send them to the bas stat
the mobl sink us the ant colony optim aco algorithm to travel a short path between the clust head
the auth contribut to pres a discret vert of the wsa algorithm for clust head select to reduc energy consum
the auth contribut by provid a mor comprehend object funct for clust network nod consid er rat energy consum pdr rat and euclid dist
clust head travers with a vert of the aco algorithm to reduc energy consum and clust head travers cod lik the tsp problem is the contribut of oth auth
the pap aim to reduc energy consum reduc the er rat of send packet and increas the lifetim of the wireless sens network
expery ar sim on sev sim scenario in matlab
criter such as energy consum packet delivery ratio pdr pack loss rat and the numb of al nod to evalu the propos method ar us
expery show that the propos algorithm reduc the energy consum and loss rat of pack of the wireless sens network by optim select clust head and increas the pdr and numb of al nod
comparison show in term of energy consum packet delivery ratio pdr loss rat of pack and the numb of al nod the propos method is mor efficy than partic swarm optim pso grey wolf optim gwo information-centric wireless sens network and clust bas rout cbr rout method
the pdr index in the propos method is eq to 97.3% and is high than pso gwo and cs algorithm
the delay of the propos method in rout is 25.97% 5.78% and 17.98% less than hho woa and gwo algorithm respect .
