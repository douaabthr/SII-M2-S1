posit of new mobl tow us circ pack problem
the circ pack problem determin a circ of the largest are that can fit into the vac spac when varvec n arbitrary-sized non-overlapping giv circ ar plac insid a giv contain
on of it num apply is to determin the optim posit of mobl tow in a city
thi constrain nonlinear optim problem is solv us four vary of the real cod genet algorithm
thes four vary ar cre by the combin of two well-known real-coded crossov op arithmet crossov and hybrid crossov and two well-known real-coded mut op uniform mut and discret uniform mut
the perform of thes algorithm is evalu us the mean standard devy best worst of the object funct valu and friedm s mean rank test is apply when 30 run of each vary ar carry out
on the bas of the comput analys the perform of the vary of rcga hav arithmet crossover-uniform mut ax-um outperform al oth rcgas consid in thi study in term of fast converg and bet acc of the solv
in a pract demonst thi methodolog is impl to a cas study in roork city in uttarakhand of north ind
cur ther ar 14 ex mobl tow in roork city
howev ther ar certain reg in which internet connect is unsatisfact
theref bas on the recommend of thi study ax-um is recommend to instal three new mobl tow .
