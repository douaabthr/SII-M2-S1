a clustering-based coevolv multi-objective evolv algorithm for handl robust and noisy optim
the pres of uncertainty is commonplac in real-world scenario
uncertainty can be pres in both the object spac and the decid spac in optim problem
thes uncertainty can pos sign challeng for evolv algorithm
for exampl perturb in decid vary robust optim and nois in object funct noisy optim
despit the plethor of method propos for robust or noisy optim address both form of uncertainty concur remain an op research quest
we introduc a novel approach bas on teda-cmoea/d aug with clust techn for descend gen in robust and noisy optim problem
not the propos algorithm yield prom result for uncertainty simult san the requir for sampl thereby reduc comput complex
we lev an extend of an ex test funct gen for multi-objective optim of the test
the benchmark integr uncertainty in decid vary and/or object funct
expery evalu encompass vary nois intens elucid the impact of diff nois level on algorithm perform
the result demonst the supery perform of the propos approach comp to ex algorithm spec rnsga-ii and crmoea/d
the propos algorithm emerg as a prom solv for robust and noisy multi-objective optim problem .
