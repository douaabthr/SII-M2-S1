a novel two-phase hybrid select mech fee to improv perform of many-objective optim algorithm
solv many-objective optim problem has becom on of the most popul research area in rec year due to it ever-increasing apply in industry and oth field
in thi pap a novel two-phase hybrid fee tphf is propos to provid elit solv for select mech of many-objective optim algorithm maoa to improv their perform
the propos tphf framework gen solv us a novel partic swarm optim pso op along with a genet algorithm op dur a two-phase calc search bas on the av veloc of the pso partic
tphf focus on the worst solv of the pop to find a bet plac for them
theref it frequ reset the pso partic to the worst solv
the new pso op us the novel ide of dynam inert and learn fact and a novel veloc upd equ
the class glob best set of the class pso op is replac by a pso fee which us the novel ide of us group of the best/worst solv to fee the new pso op bas on the phas of the search
the propos tphf is apply to som of the most fam and state-of-the-art maoa with their correspond default paramet
the result of the comparison between thes maoa with their correspond tphf vert on maf test suit show a sign improv in the perform of the tphf vert in 62.2% of the cas . graph abstract
