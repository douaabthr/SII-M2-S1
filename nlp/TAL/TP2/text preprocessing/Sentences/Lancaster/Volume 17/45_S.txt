a template-based algorithm by geomet mean for the autom and efficy recognit of mus chord
in thi work we introduc a template-based comput method to recogn chord through an audio record of a mus instru
the algorithm is bas on a temp frequ analys us gab s filt bank
thes filt ar cent ov adjust frequ of mus not in diff octav and the adjust is accompl in term of the detun on the record
us the result in the filt stag a geomet mean of each chord is calc
it is import to ment that thes stat ar calc from the combin of not that form each chord and ar autom group as templ
the pres of chord is determin from thes met
sev expery ar carry out for maj min aug dimin and suspend chord play on acoust guit class guit elect guit piano and ukulel
a comp study against machine-learning class is pres
the result show a supery perform of the pres approach
in addit the propos method pres the adv that it doe not requir a train stag in contrast with the method bas on machine-learning algorithm
thi reduc sign the stor and tim requy for process .
