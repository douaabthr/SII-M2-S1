an extrem learn machin model bas on adapt multi-fusion chaot sparrow search algorithm for regress and class
extrem learn machin elm is a machin learn algorithm bas on singl hid lay feedforward neur network
comp with tradit neur network algorithm elm has the adv of fast train spee and good gen abl with guarantee learn acc which has been wid us in pract problem
howev due to the random of hid lay paramet the origin elm requir mor hid neuron in apply mak the network mor complex
for thi reason we propos an improv extrem learn machin bas on the adapt multi-fusion chaot sparrow search algorithm amfcss cal amfcssa-elm
in our work amfcss is spec design which combin the techn of chaot map adapt weight coefficy vary spir fact andt-distribution mut to optim the input weight and hid bias of elm
first unimod and multimod test funct ar us to ver the perform of amfcss the result show that amfcss can search for the glob optim valu bet than pso ssa and so on
second vary nonlinear funct and class dataset ar tak to test the cap of amfcssa-elm the sim result show that our method has bet gen perform comp with oth simil algorithm such as pso-elm ssa-elm .
