deepsens test priorit for neur network bas on multipl mut and manifold spat distribut
deep learn system hav been us extend in sev field in rec year but deep neur network dnn can also mak incorrect decid and lead to sign loss
test task bas on dnn system oft requir annot of test dat to obtain orac inform
howev collect and annot larg amount of disp dat from apply scenario is very expend and tim consum
thu we propos deepsens an effect neur network test priorit techn to select mor test input that rev neur network fault as ear as poss in the unlabel test dataset
deepsens consid the ful rang of model fault detect cap includ fault near the bound and near the centroid of class
to be spec we first design multipl mut feat and extract them from the neur network model and input sampl bas on diff mut op
then the sampl embed feat ar extract to construct an undirect weight graph and a random walk is perform to calc the dist simil and manifold simil and then spat nearest neighb feat ar design and extract
fin mlp is us to combin multipl mut feat and spat nearest neighb feat to predict the input sampl fault rev abl and set pri accord
we evalu deepsens on four popul im dataset and result show that deepsens sign outperform ex test input priorit techn .
