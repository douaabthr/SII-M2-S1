solv multi-objective truss structural optim problem consid nat frequ of vibr and autom memb group
minim the mass of a structure and maxim it first nat frequ of vibr ar conflict object of real interest in structural design
to avoid problem with reson which can lead to their collaps structures can be design by mak the first nat frequ of vibr high
furtherm it is cruc to stay away from excit frequ
her we form and solv multi-objective structural optim problem of truss with thes conflict object
thi typ of problem is uncommon in the lit sint the nat frequ of vibr ar gen set as constraint rath than as object funct
the gen diff evolv 3 gde3 the nondomin sort genet algorithm ii nsga-ii decid space-based nich dn-nsga-ii the competit mechanism-based multi-objective partic swarm optim cmopso and the mopso with multipl search strategies mmopso ar the algorithm us in thi pap
addit cardin constraint ar us to man the difficul of discov the best memb group which is very effect in address the problem analys in thi pap
the expery ref to the 10 25 72 and 200 bar truss
each involv two analys tak into account the perform ind and the us of a mult tourna decid mtd method to extract the desir solv
furtherm the design vary of each extract solv includ it optim topolog ar provid .
