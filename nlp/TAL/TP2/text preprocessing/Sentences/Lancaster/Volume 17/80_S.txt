the study in the past rev that the combin econom emit dispatch cee problem has been solv by evolv and swarm intelligence-based optim algorithm
howev the methodolog to ident the best comprom solv for the cee problem has not been study much in the lit
in thi pap a multi-objective optim algorithm which reduc fuel cost of pow gen as wel as emit simult is pres
the algorithm is a combin of an art bee colony algorithm abc and a non-dominated sort genet algorithm nsga-ii with a new constraint handl feat
to valid the effect of the propos algorithm it is apply to three benchmark system common us to study the effect of optim algorithm
moreov the best comprom solv obtain by the propos algorithm is ident by us sixteen multi-attribute decision-making madm method
the non-dominated solv report in the past lit for diff test system ar also analys us madm method
it has been shown that the propos algorithm giv bet result without viol the constraint and with the minim numb of it .
