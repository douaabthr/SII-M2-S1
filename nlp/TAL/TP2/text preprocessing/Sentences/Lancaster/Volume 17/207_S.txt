the oyst collect algorithm
thi artic focus on the develop of metah algorithm bas on the search process and collect of the oyst liv or non-living from the sea bed in the day tim
in the coast belt dur tid oyst ar push by the wat wav and gath in spec plac on the sea bed
for liv oyst they ar gen found in the cold-water reg but for non-living shel they can be found anywh in the sea bed depend on the blow of the wind and the path of the wat wav
sint oyst hav many econom valu becaus indo dec orna and gift pack etc
ar mad us thes sea shel peopl from coast zon us collect them and plan for on of the best job trad in their soc lif
inspir from the nat of the collect proc of the shel we construct mathem funct of the search path along which it can be avail mor
util thi proc into the field of optim we hav found som nobl result of a benchmark problem
bas we fit an appropry test funct for a benchmark problem then som num expery result ar comput via oyst collect algorithm
a comp study has also been mad to valid the propos approach
moreov consid the norm of the dat we hav study confid interv and analys stat for the glob acceiv of the method
it is also seen that the root mean squ er rmse for our propos algorithm is 0.004007 and that for the oth ex algorithm it becom 0.007015
thi giv the excel success rat in the field of optim with respect to oth al the tim
indee the graph illust show the eff of the propos algorithm and fin a conclud is mad about keep som scop for fut work .
