investig of kriging-based saea metamodel sampl for comput expend optim problem
surrog model assist evolv algorithm saea ar strategies wid apply to deal with comput expend optim problem ceop
thes method employ metamodel to driv an evolv algorithm ea to prom design reg wher new evalu on the true-objectiv funct must be perform
to do thi saea ar requir to handl the challeng of train a metamodel to improv it predict
the rely of a metamodel is strongly rel to the sampl us for it train
despit thi sev saea ar propos without concern about the sampl strategy employ
the id situ is to obtain a sampl not far away from the solv predict on the metamodel
in thi sens the contribution/novelty of thi pap regard an investig study to comp fiv strategies for defin the metamodel sampl in a propos sae framework saea/f
the saea/f us a one-dimensional ordin krig ok metamodel and an expect improv ei merit funct is apply to defin on which solv to spend the budget of true-function evalu
in thi investig each strategy is incorp into saea/f and then us to solv a set of analys funct of single-objectiv optim problem
the comput result suggest that two of the fiv sampl strategies stand out the best
the first strategy choos thos solv with the lowest dist to the centroid of the pop of solv and the second select the newest solv evalu on true-objectiv funct
the result highlight the pot of thes approach for solv expend optim problem sint they spee up the algorithm converg to improv solv .
