histogram-based comparison of met spac us hmms
comparison is a pow tool for decid support
many meas hav been propos for comp two met spac but they do not consid the dat dispers in each met spac
furtherm no ded meas has yet been propos for comp two met spac contain el belong to vary subtyp of a glob datatyp
in ord to attenu the af limit thi pap propos a new techn for comp two met spac
mor form giv a met spacex histogram ar us for perform a grad analys of the dat dispers insid the neighb of each el ofx
thi is a refin of the neighb analys real in an ex work
then anoth ex techn is us for assocy on hid markov model lambd _x withxsuch that lambd _x learn the bin valu and the vis shap of the histogram der from the inst inx
meta-dat der from lambd _x ar then sav as the compon of a describ vect overrightarrow x assocy withx
fin the comparison between two met spac is perform through the comparison of their respect assocy describ vect us ex dist or simil meas between two vect
the propos approach inherit the acc and the efficy of the ex techn on which it rely
theref the expery real in thi pap ar on intend to show how it can be us for comp particul met spac contain geoloc or star in the celest sphere .
