singl candid optim a novel optim algorithm
single-solution-based optim algorithm hav gain littl to no at by the research commun unlik population-based approach
thi pap propos a novel optim algorithm cal singl candid optim sco that rely on on a singl candid solv throughout the whol optim process
the propos algorithm impl a un set of equ to effect upd the posit of the candid solv
to bal expl and exploit sco is integr with the two-phase strategy wher the candid solv upd it posit diff in each phas
the effect of the propos approach is valid by test it on thirty three class benchmark funct and four real-world engin problem
sco is comp with three well-known optim algorithm i.e. partic swarm optim grey wolf optim and gravit search algorithm and with four rec high-performance algorithm equilibr optim archim optim algorithm mayf algorithm and salp swarm algorithm
accord to friedm and wilcoxon rank-sum test sco can sign outperform al oth algorithm for the maj of the investig problem
the result achiev by sco mot the design and develop of new single-solution-based optim algorithm to furth improv the perform
the sourc cod of sco is publ avail at https uk . mathwork . com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/116100-single-candidate-optimizer .
