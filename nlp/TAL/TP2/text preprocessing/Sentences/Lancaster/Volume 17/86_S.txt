design and manufact of an x-ray gen by support vect machin
on approach to the design expery paramet set and assembl of an x-ray gen get perform to reduc rady emit microgray mu gy without neglect the pow of the beam emit kvp
a combin get mad in the manufact of the transform coil between turn of the second wind s_ k with the numb of turn of the fila f_ i
as a result we obtain a transform with an emit between the desir paramet and the optim beam pow
we class feas and infeas cas in the assembl of x-ray dev us support vect machin
in addit the tool us for stat inf wer non-parametric test such as the mod friedm test and post-hoc quad and conov test
fin we obtain a good im with an excel resolv without expos peopl to high rady emit .
