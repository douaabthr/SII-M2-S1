j-type random 2,3 satisfy a higher-ord log rul in discret hopfield neur network
the discret hopfield neur network has been wid us for solv combin optim problem
dhnn is a simpl structure with no hid lay and bin input/output which lead to low complex comp to oth network
satisfy as a neuron repres is consid a suit log structure due to it simpl construct
dhnn model has the pot for enh by incorp vary log rul
the main problem of ex work is the nee for higher-ord log rul combin with system non-systematic log
thi pap propos a novel satisfy log structure nam j-type random 2,3 satisfy by consid both the charact of the second and third-order vary per claus
the propos log rul random assign valu bas on the structure of eith second-order third-order or both ord of the claus
the propos j random 2,3 satisfy log rul wil stor the inform extern and on be tru if al the claus ar satisfy
thi log wil be impl into the discret hopfield neur network
by util the propos hybrid log rul spec the j random 2,3 satisfy the neuron in the hopfield neur network can be effect model
the model wil be evalu us vary perform met in term of learn er retriev er energy analys and simil analys
the propos log wil undergo a comparison analys with prevy est log rul
bas on the ratio of glob solv the propos model exhibit a slow declin from 1 to 0 as the numb of neuron increas which suggest that the propos model wil outperform ex model in retriev glob neuron stat .
