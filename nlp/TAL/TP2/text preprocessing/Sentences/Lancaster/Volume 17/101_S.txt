intellig contribut of the art orc algorithm for continu problem and real-time emerg med serv
the art orc algorithm ao is an ex swarm intellig algorithm empow in thi pap by two well-known mut op and opposition-based learn yield the novel method deep self-learning art orc algorithm dslaoa opposit deep self-learning art orc algorithm odslao and opposit art orc learn algorithm
the dslaoa and odslao ar bas on the cauchy and gauss mut op
their effect is evalu on both continu and discret problem
