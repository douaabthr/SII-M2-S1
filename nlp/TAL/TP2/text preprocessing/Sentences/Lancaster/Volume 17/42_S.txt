research on stor method for fuzzy rdf graph bas on neo4j
with the wid apply of the sem web and the rapid develop of the resourc describ framework rdf the demand for dat process of inconsist or imprec inform has becom mor and mor urg
rec the fuzzy extend of rdf dat has receiv widespread at becaus of their abl to repres and process fuzzy inform
an import issu for the success of fuzzy rdf apply is how to achiev persist dat stor and query cap
in thi artic we investig the stor and query of fuzzy rdf dat
to accompl thi we study how to form map fuzzy rdf graph repres by the label direct graph structure to property graph pgs databas stor model
we impl the process that the map rel between fuzzy rdf graph and property graph
moreov we man thes dat by a chos neo4j graph dbms in ord to support express query serv ov the stor dat
fin we hav comp our method bas on neo4j graph databas with the method bas on rel databas and the expery result prov that us the graph databas model to stor fuzzy rdf graph dat set is effect and feas .
