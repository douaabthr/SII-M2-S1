toward robust autom math problem solv a survey of stat and deep learn approach
autom mathem problem-solving repres a un intersect of nat langu process nlp and mathem reason pos sign challeng in sem comprehend and log deduc
thi survey pap expl the domain of mathem word problem mwps focus on the nuant integr of lingu understand and mathem log requir for their resolv
despit progress the autom solv of mwps through nlp techn remain challeng
we pres a comprehend review of the latest dataset and comput model focus on thos address geomet tabul and multimod problem types-area not extend cov in pri survey
our review extend beyond prevy survey by analys the solv of mwps in langu such as hind and arab area less expl in ex research
we crit review the latest dataset and comput model design for mwps highlight the scarc of resourc that cat to the complex of problem in hind arab and simil langu
thi gap undersc the nee for comprehend dataset that reflect the divers of mwps in thes langu and for model cap of navig the lingu nuant inh in non-english and non-chinese context
our analys point to the limit of cur approach includ their foc on spec dat form and limit gen across diff mathem context
furtherm our crit analys ident prevail limit within cur methodolog includ over-reliance on spec dat form and a lack of gen across divers mathem context
in respons we propos a research agend to develop soph model that understand and reason across a broad spectr of problem typ and langu and cre dataset that capt the real-world divers of mwps in hind arab and beyond
thi pap set a direct for fut research to adv nlp-driven mathem problem-solving toward techn adept and univers appl model across lingu bound thereby mak strides toward tru glob nlp apply in educ and beyond .
