chaot grady bas optim for solv multidimend unconstrain and constrain optim problem
gradient-based optim grad belong to the rec develop population-based metah algorithm inspir by the develop of newton-type method
despit it new emerg ther ar many success apply of thi optim in the ex lit howev chao integr vert of thi algorithm has not been extend study yet
in his study twenty-one diff chaot map hav been incorp into the standard grad algorithm to maintain a rely bal between expl and exploit mech which is not robust construct within the origin algorithm
first ninety-nine thirty dimend art gen optim benchmark problem compr of sixty-eight multimod and thirty-one unimod funct hav been solv by thes chaot vary of the grad algorithm to determin the fiv best perform method between them
clear domin of the chaot algorithm is clear observ ov the entir rang of benchmark cas in term of solv acc and robust
then to valid the optim cap of the chao integr grad algorithm the best method among them is test on fourteen constrain real world engin problem and it respect feas result ar benchmark against thos obtain from cut edg metah optim
it is seen that the chaot grad algorithm is abl to effect compet with oth state-of-art algorithm on both solv unconstrain and constrain engin problem
moreov it is observ that the chebyshev chaot map improv grad algorithm outperform it contemp in both unconstrain and constrain cas .
