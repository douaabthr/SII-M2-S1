discret marin pred algorithm for symmet travel salesm problem
thi pap address the well-known np-hard problem the symmet travel salesm problem stsp which has num apply in log and graph the
to solv thi complex problem a discret vert of the marin pred algorithm d-mpa is introduc
although mpa has been extend study for vary optim problem and real-world apply it us in rout problem particul tsp remain rel unexpl
to adapt mpa for stsp the posit of individ ar init upd us the class mpa algorithm
the continu valu gen by the class mpa ar then convert to discret valu follow by the apply of a permut op to maintain divers in the pop
in addit a loc search algorithm 2 opt is apply to furth improv the result for stsp inst
the effect of the propos algorithm is demonst on stsp benchmark inst of siz rang from 14 to 439
the perform of d-mpa is comp against sev ex algorithm includ the genet algorithm ga bat algorithm ba discret firef algorithm dfa evolv sim an es island-bas distribut genet algorithm idg discret imp competit algorithm dic and discret grey wolf optim dgwo
to ens an unbias and rig comparison describ stat such as mean and standard devy ar us and a wilcoxon signed-rank test is conduc for stat valid
the result demonst that d-mpa not on compet but also consist outperform thes algorithm mak it a valu resourc for the research commun .
