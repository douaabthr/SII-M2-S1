a dynam tri-population multi-objective evolv algorithm for constrain multi-objective optim problem
bal between the converg feas and divers of the pop is the key to solv constrain multi-objective optim problem cmop
howev the ex constrain multi-objective optim evolv algorithm cmoea fac challeng in converg to the constrain pareto front cpf with well-distributed feas solv
to address thi issu thi pap propos a dynam tri-population multi-objective evolv algorithm cal tdpscmo
in the init phas the first and second pop evolv dynam to solv the origin cmop and the unconstrain multi-objective optim problem mop

the perform of tdpscmo is furth test through 57 benchmark test problem and 21 real-world apply us sev state-of-the-art algorithm
the result show the competit of the propos algorithm when address cmop .
