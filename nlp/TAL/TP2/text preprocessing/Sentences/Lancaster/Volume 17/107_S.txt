multi-objective optim design of propel us the blad el the and evolv algorithm
a multi-objective optim design of propel is pres
tradit the definit of propel is don by choos model that already ex on the market
howev with the adv of technolog such as 3d print and comput num control the poss for the design to seek an optim propel for his design is increas feas
in thi scenario thi pap aim to propos a methodolog that allow the design to find altern propel design
the methodolog compr the cre refin and extend of an airfoil databas avail from the lit
the aerodynam analys us the blad el the and the optim with evolv algorithm
sev multi-objective constrain optim problem wer form with two three and four conflict object funct concern the propel aerodynam and geomet inform such as the thrust coefficy the bend coefficy the efficy and the volum of the propel
among them for inst two propos form ar i maxim the thrust and minim the bend coefficy simult ii maxim the thrust coefficy minim the bend coefficy minim the volum of the propel and minim the efficy simult
