eeg sign class us a new rad bas funct neur network and jellyf meta-heuristic algorithm
the purpos of thi pap is to investig a new method for eeg sign class
a pow method for detect thes sign can gre contribut to area such as mak robot arm for dis peopl mind read and lie detect tool
to thi end thi study mak two interest contribut
as a maj contribut a new class bas on a rad bas funct neur network rbfnn is pres
as the cent determin method of a rbfnn class has a high impact on the fin class result we hav adopt jellyf search js algorithm for choos the cent of the gauss funct in the hid lay of the rbfnn class
addit loc linear embed lle techn is investig for reduc the dimend of eeg sign
two sery of vary expery ar design to valid our propos
in the first set of the expery the propos rbfnn class is comp with oth state-of-the-art rbfnn class
in the second set of the expery the perform of the propos eeg sign class ar evalu on a challeng dataset for eeg sign class
the expery result demonst the supery of our propos method ev comp to the method bas on the convolv neur network .
