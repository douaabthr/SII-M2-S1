improv har hawk optim algorithm to solv the multi-depot op vehic rout problem
the multi-depot op vehic rout problem mdovrp is on on exampl of sev optim problem that ar class as np-hard
theref heur and metah approach ar help in obtain a near-optimal solv
a hybrid hho algorithm cal hho-pso is propos in thi work to address the mdovrp
the goal is to minim cost for the rout of a fleet of vehic that start mov from depot and fulfil custom demand
to improv the expl of the har hawk optim hho algorithm the expl method of partic swarm optim pso which is mor robust is us in thi pap
expery result prov that the propos hybrid algorithm work bet than the origin pso and hho in discret spac in term of bal exploit and expl to solv the mdovrp
moreov the suggest algorithm is comp to fiv cutting-edge approach on 24 mdovrp inst with a broad numb of custom
the comput find rev that the suggest approach outperform the oth comp metah techn in solv the mdovrp .
