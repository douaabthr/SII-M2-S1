optim alloc of wat resourc in guyu city bas on improv nsga-iii algorithm
in ord to allevy the problem of wat resourc short and uneq distribut in tim and spac in guyu city thi pap first analys the bas situ of wat resourc in guyu city and construct a multi-objective optim alloc model of wat resourc with econom benefit soc benefit and ecolog benefit as the object
then nsga-iii algorithm is propos to solv the optim alloc scheme of wat resourc
bas on the origin nsga-iii algorithm multi-point crossov op and multi-point mut op nam non-dominated sort genet algorithm-iii with random multipoint crossov mut rnsga-iii ar us
in the select of the next gen saw and mcdm schemes wer us to evalu the chromosomes and set the weight to achiev bet and mor id result
fin the propos scheme is comp with the ex config scheme bas on nsga-iii and nsga-ii algorithm
sim expery show that the propos scheme is bet than the alloc scheme bas on nsga-iii algorithm and nsga-ii algorithm in the comprehend cost of econom benefit wat short and ecolog benefit which can provid a bas for the rat alloc of wat resourc in guyu city achiev un man and sustain util of wat resourc and support the sustain develop of econom and socy .
