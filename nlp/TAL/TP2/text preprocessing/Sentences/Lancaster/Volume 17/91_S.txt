improv ant colony algorithm in path plan of a singl robot and multi-robots with multi-objective
in ord to solv the problem of path plan of a singl robot and multi-robots with multi-objective an improv ant colony algorithm is propos . in the improv ant colony algorithm both loc and glob optim search ar consid
in loc optim search grady distribut is us to init the pheromon cont to improv the converg spee of the algorithm
the self-adaptive impact fact is us to enh bet fit of the algorithm in diff environ
in glob optim search a reward and pun mech has been est to improv the pheromon upd strategy
furtherm a nod rearrang strategy is adopt to increas the divers of solv
accord to the improv colony algorithm the problem of path plan of a singl robot and multi-robots with multi-objective can be solv
in two diff scenario comp expery show that the improv colony algorithm can obtain bet path leng converg spee and run tim than tradit ant colony algorithm aco and the improv ant colony algorithm iaco-sfla in path plan of a singl robot
sim result also show that the improv ant colony algorithm has good abl in multi-objective path plan
espec al robot can saf reach the target by mov simult and obstac can be effect avoid too .
