energy aw cluster-based rout in wsn us hybrid pelican-blue monkey optim algorithm
as the nod in wireless sens network wsns ar pow by battery energy efficy is a maj concern
sint commun consum the most energy efficy rout becom an effect solv
a typ rout strategy is to us hierarch clust algorithm
in hierarch rout schemes a clust arrang of sens nod sns is us to facilit dat merg and aggreg
the clust head ar in charg of obtain dat from the clust s sns and gath and del the dat they receiv at bs
thes dat ar combin and pool at the clust head ch level result in consid energy sav
howev ther ar certain rely issu in clust head select chs and optim rout
to model a chs and optim rout in wsn thi work carry out the chs us improv kernel fuzzy c mean clust for select the ch by consid energy and dist
then optim rout is don by deploy a novel optim scheme nam custom pel with blu monkey optim cp-bmo which off the optim rout by consid trust and risk constraint
also the cp-bmo model hold bet energy consum which is 35.65% 29.42% 38.79% 25.31% 39.85% 39.16% 9.55% 29.39% 39.32% and 39.32% supery to abo rhso pel bmo f-fly aef ml-aefa et ga and qobo respect
at last the sim outcom confirm the develop approach s effect on pdr network lifetim etc .
