research on uncertain bi-objective uav miss alloc problem
bas on the uncertainty the thi pap study the uncertain bi-objective uav miss alloc problem in uncertain environ
first by regard uncertainty fact in the miss alloc plan as uncertain vary and consid two miss of comb miss gain and flight fuel consum a uncertain bi-objective uav miss alloc ubum model is est
second in ord to overcom the disconnect between the object funct caus by the tradit method to deal with uncertain fact thi pap propos a so-called uncertain method to solv ubmu problem by defin the rel of ord between uncertain vary
accord the real decision-making process the ubum is transform into a single-objectiv program problem by us c_e principl rel
fin the ant algorithm is employ to solv the single-objectiv program problem and then the c_e efficy miss rout ar obtain
the sim result show that thi method can effect deal with ubum problem and the miss alloc efficy rout is reason .
