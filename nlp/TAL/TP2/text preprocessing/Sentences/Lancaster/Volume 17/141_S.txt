geomet mean optim for achiev efficy in truss structural design
the object of thi study is to util the geomet mean optim gmo for mass optim of structural truss
by har the gmo s mut mech root in a gauss framework the model effect address the discret nat of truss structure optim
through a comprehend evalu involv four distinct problem scenario includ 10 15 25 and 52 bar truss structures with both discret and continu vary the effect of the gmo techn is thorough demonst
the optim find undersc that the gmo consist gen improv design in comparison to conv population-based techn
furtherm the gmo model demonst remark comput efficy in spec cas
thi research emphas the pot of the gmo-based approach as a pot tool in the domain of truss structure optim
it hold the cap to revolv the man in which engin approach the int bal between structural integr minim weight and cost-effectiveness .
