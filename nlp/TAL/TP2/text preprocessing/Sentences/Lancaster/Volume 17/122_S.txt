a divers preserv genet algorithm with tailor-made vary op for the quadr bottleneck knapsack problem
thi pap deal with a vary of the knapsack problem cal the quadr bottleneck knapsack problem qbkp
in qbkp ther is a quadr cost assocy with each pair of object and the object is to minim the maxim quadr cost such that sumtot of weight of object should be at least eq to the capac of knapsack
despit the pract apply of thi mathc n mathc p hard problem in select invest for a portfolio it remain an under-studied problem as on a few exact and heur approach ex in the lit
thi has mot us to develop a metah approach bas on steady-state genet algorithm ssga for the qbkp
our ssga approach us worst among most simil replac strategy to preserv us pop divers which has a sign impact on the perform of our algorithm
furth our crossov and mut op ar design as per the charact of the qbkp
we hav expery comp the perform of our propos approach with thos avail in the lit and clear demonst our approach to be bet .
