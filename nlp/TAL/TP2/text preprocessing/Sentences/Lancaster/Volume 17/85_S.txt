a new method for build singl feedforward neur network model for mult stat regress problem a combin weight init and construct algorithm
the perform of model bas on a feedforward neur network depend strongly on the init estim of weight and the numb of unit in the hid lay
thi work pres a new method for the init of weight and definit of the numb of hid unit in the id of multipl input singl output model assocy with regress problem
the init strategy consist of a complet linear of the network with on on neuron unit around an equilibr point and the determin of the init weight through the maxim approxim of the linear model to the optim linear regress whos solv can be obtain analys
the construct algorithm perform a grad increas in the numb of hid unit in such a way that at each train on weight assocy with new hid unit ar random init whil weight obtain from prevy train ar us as init guess for the subsequ on
the propos method was comp to the class random init method and to the extrem learn machin a typ gradient-free learn algorithm both of which also involv a construct approach to defin the fin network
the method wer apply to 11 real dataset wid us as benchmark for regress problem
the propos method perform bet than the oth approach in 8 9 cas study and was abl to ens a monoton decreas in the loss funct with an increas numb of hid unit .
