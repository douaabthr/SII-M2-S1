deep learn dl a subfield of machin learn ml has shown gre prom in address the challeng of process and analys such dat
consid the increas import of dl and dat analys we decid to review the artic of the last few year in thi field to pav the way for research
in thi artic we us the system lit review slr method and in lin with that we select and analys 56 artic publ from 2019 to april 2024
we first discuss the dl model us in the iot field and clar their spec us cas
second we outlin an analys of research area in dl-based iot
in addit our research extend to the tool and sim us to evalu study in the dl-based iot domain
we also examin the dl-based iot research dataset
fin our review ident fut direct and op issu in dl-based iot
we aim to contribut to an acc understand of the cur stat challeng and pot breakthrough at the intersect of dl and the iot .
