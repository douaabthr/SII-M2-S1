a gam the bas approach for distribut dynam spectr access
in thi study we expl the task of dynam spectr access bas on gam the to mitig spectr short and improv network util in multichannel wireless network
us the avail network bandwid is limit and divid into sev channel and ther ex a nee for efficy reus and adapt alloc of such channel
dur the commun process uus compet with each oth forcsh channel ev without know acc complet channel stat inform
in ord to avoid collid tradit method us depend on cent scheduling or mess exchang which ar cumbersom and comput expend
to deal with thi issu we propos a deep q-network bas on lstm and fair channel alloc policy to learn the dynam spectr access rul for network util maxim
extend valid of the propos approach show that our scheme yield quit prom result .
