design optim of cam follow mech us rao algorithm and their vary
thi pap pres the design optim of cam follow mech cfm with ecc rol typ follow us rec develop adv optim algorithm nam rao samp-rao and qo-rao algorithm
four typ of follow mot law i.e. cycloid mod harmon 3 4 5 degr polynom and 4 5 6 7 degr polynom mot ar consid
the cfm is optim to minim three object such as the input torqu nee to rot the cam the radi of the pitch circ of the cam and the maxim contact stress
the problem has fiv continu design vary nam the rol radi rg the radi of cam bas circ rb the dist between the follow bear and the cent of the cam q the ecc of the follow e and the leng of follow bear b
eight design constraint rel to the geometry of the cam mech the press angl the efficy of the mech the curv radi of the pitch curv and the maxim contact stress ar consid
the comput result obtain us rao algorithm and their vary ar comp with oth adv optim algorithm such as the salp swarm algorithm ssa ant lion optim alo moth flam optim mfo mult vers optim mvo evap rat wat cyc algorithm er-wca grey wolf optim gwo and min blast algorithm mba
the comparison of optim result rev that the optim valu of a fit funct obtain us rao algorithm and their vary is supery to gwo alo mfo ssa er-wca mba and mvo for al four cas consid
the optim fit funct valu of the cfm with cas ii is reduc by 3.14% 4.13% and 7.61% comp to the cfm s fit funct valu with the cas i cas ii and cas iv respect
hent the 3 4 5 degr polynom mot of the follow is effect for bet perform of the cfm
also the av tim requir for rao algorithm and their vary is comp sign less than the oth algorithm consid
the effect of rao algorithm and their vary wil help the commun to improv the optim solv to their problem in their respect research field
also rao algorithm wil decreas the research effort requir to tun the algorithm-specific control paramet as thes algorithm do not hav algorithm-specific control paramet
furtherm the friedm rank test prov the sign of the stat result acquir us rao algorithm and their vary .
