research on pcb defect detect us art intellig a system map study
smt surfac mount technolog has been the backbon of pcb print circuit board produc for the last coupl of decad
ev though the spee and acc of smt hav been drast improv in the last decad er dur produc ar stil a very valid problem for the pcb industry
with the expon ris of art intellig in the last decad the smt industry was on of the most eag industry to us thi new technolog to detect poss defect dur produc
lat tradit im process techn start to lag behind method such as machin learn and deep learn when the discuss cam to the nee of high acc
in thi pap we screen academ libr to understand which of the latest method and techn ar us in the domain and to deduc a gen process for detect defect in pcbs
dur the research we hav investig research quest rel to state-of-the-art method high ment dataset and sought aft pcb defect
al find and answ ar map to be abl to understand wher thi pursuit might point toward
from a tot of 270 pap 90 of them wer address in detail and 78 pap wer chos for thi system map .
