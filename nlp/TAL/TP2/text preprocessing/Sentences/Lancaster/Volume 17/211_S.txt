fqpdr fed quant neur network for privacy-preserving ear detect of diabet retinopathy
diabet retinopathy dr is a common comply of diabet that can lead to blind of peopl
detect dr at the earliest stag is ess to prev irrevers ey dam
microaneurysm dot ar the first sign of dr
as the dot ar tiny and of low contrast detect mild dr is a very challeng task
fed learn fl preserv dat priv which is a maj concern for med im process
fl is a collab learn method which shar on the model paramet with a serv without shar the paty dat to a cent serv
inspir by class fl we propos a fed learning-based quant neur network fed qnn for thi task
we impl the model with limit sampl and few learn paramet from the e-ophtha and retin mnist dataset
the cross-evaluation efficy of the propos fed quant neur network system for privacy-preserving ear detect of diabet retinopathy fqpdr in kaggl dataset im ind the robust of the light weight learn model
fqpdr perform ar inspir whil consid ex non-fl and fl method .
