a novel giant pac octop optim for real-world engin problem
giant pac octop optim gpoo a new swarm computational-intelligence metah approach is a nat algorithm bas on the behavy of octopus as they struggle to liv in the environ
the gpoo model which ar two prim techn search and attack prey ar off for algorithm optim
the transit between the expl and exploit stag ar handl in a way that strikes an appropry bal
a num of test ar carry out to ver the novel optim process s capac to ident the best solv to diff optim issu
the gpoo model is evalu us 10 complex benchmark funct for cec2019 and 23 class benchmark funct
addit the result ar comp to oth metah algorithm
glob algorithm ar also employ to address pract engin techn issu
the outcom show that gpoo demonst oth comp method in term of converg spee and success loc al or most local/glob optim .
