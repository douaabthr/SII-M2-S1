an evolv multitask optim algorithm via reference-point bas nondomin sort approach
multiobject multifact evolv algorithm momfe which solv multipl task simult bas on a singl pop has receiv consid at in rec decad
howev the neg transmit us lead to slow converg or wors distribut
to mak us of the pot simil between diff task thi pap propos an enh vert for the momfe us a reference-point bas nondomin sort approach denot as mfea-rp
by us multipl dimend scal subtask in diff dimend can be optim simult with a singl set of ref point
the efficy of the method is substanty by multiobject benchmark problem and pract inst
in most of the test prob mfea-rp converg fast to the tru pareto front
better-distributed solv ar success found which ind the bet repres to the solv spac .
