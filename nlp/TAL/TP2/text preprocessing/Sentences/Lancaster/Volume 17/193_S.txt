a real and sustain log transport plan a new cost model meta-heuristic solv approach and result
acc log cost en efficy and cost-effective plan of transport system
it facilit the fast on-time and seamless transport of good between the city
ex cost model ar bas on the unit transport cost of good which could be mor real and acc
in thi work we introduc a new cost funct bas on the unit transport cost of a truck to overcom the undercharg or overcharg issu in the ex cost funct
the propos cost funct best suit the govern and industry when develop the facil
thi work also pres the log transport problem form of a cost funct us integ program and methodolog to solv the transport problem us meta-heuristic algorithm
in addit we construct a new transport problem for on district-one produc odop us real-world scenario and dat
odop is an in of the utt pradesh govern for the bal econom develop of the stat in ind
we solv thi 18 city problem us eight meta-heuristic algorithm
our expery sim find an optim log cost of rs
2159140.00 for four log hub and 14 distribution/collect cent
our observ also ident the depend of network config ov vary fact lik establishment/rental and op cost the unit cost of transport and the capac of vehic instead of on on produc supply and demand of goods/product
our evalu also report an 80% consist result by the anti-predatory nature-inspired algorithm comp to the oth state-of-the-art algorithm .
