clust bas act learn for class of evolv streams
class of imb unlabel dat streams with conceiv drift in evolv streams has pos many challeng rec
learn perform from the min class is poor at high imb degr
thi caus drift detect to fail
theref the ex model cannot be upd result in poor class perform
detect drift is typ don through superv learn
they ar impract despit their effect in detect drift
in real-world apply on a port of the dat stream can be label as orac assist is pricey and lab
to allevy thes problem a novel techn which is a clust bas act learn for class imb and conceiv drift cbal is pres in the pap
adapt sampl strategies ar us for solv high imb degr
a two-layer drift detect strategy is us for detect drift wher the first lay is unsuperv and the second lay is superv
to reduc the label cost thi framework us a clust techn for query the label
extend expery ov synthet and real-world dat streams exhibit bet class perform
cbal detect the drift with few fals alarm and with less orac interv
for high imb cas i.e. 10% the perform of cbal is 53% and high wherea the perform of the oth algorithm is zero or nil
the numb of drift detect by cbal is much mor acc and it also reduc the label cost by 90% .
