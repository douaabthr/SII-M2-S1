qualit diff between evolv strategies and reinforc learn method for control of autonom ag
in thi pap we analys the qualit diff between evolv strategies and reinforc learn algorithm by focus on two popul state-of-the-art algorithm the openai-es evolv strategy and the proxim policy optim ppo reinforc learn algorithm the most simil method of the two famy
we analys how the method diff with respect to i gen eff ii abl to cop with reward which ar spars in tim ii propensity/capac to discov minim solv iv depend on reward shap and v abl to cop with vary of the environ condit
the analys of the perform and of the behavy strategies display by the ag train with the two method on benchmark problem en us to demonst qualit diff which wer not ident in prevy study to ident the rel weak of the two method and to propos way to am som of thos weak
we show that the charact of the reward funct has a strong impact which vary qualit not on for the openai-es evolv algorithm and the ppo reinforc learn algorithm but also for oth reinforc learn algorithm thu demonst the import of optim the charact of the reward funct to the algorithm us .
