a novel two-stage bio-inspired method us red deer algorithm for dat clust
dat clust is a method of divid dat point into simil group
in the last few decad ther hav been num adv in algorithm and methodolog for the analys of clust dat
although som algorithm likek-means due to their easy impl and interpret ar wid us for clust their cap of provid good solv might be sensit to the numb of dimend and clust
due to the adv of metaheuristic-based clust approach lik strong search they hav been wid us to tackl the clust problem
bas on thi prem we propos a new bio-inspired red deer clust algorithm rdca
red deer algorithm rda is a new metah inspir by the behavy of the scot red deer dur a bree season
first the dat spac is partit into sev divid each of which is repres by a disjunct norm form express us cliqu algorithm
then a search strategy employ a mod vert of rda is pursu
expery ar carry out to assess the perform of rdca in comparison to eight tradit method us six real-world and three gen dataset in term of clust valid meas nam compact sep combin tur davy bouldin and norm mut inform scor
the propos method can handl multipl object funct simult and show good perform when the dat dimend is larg
the result ind that in most scenario the propos method outperform it counterpart
it is also shown that the propos algorithm is less sensit to increas the numb of clust and dimend .
