re-formulated snowflak optim algorithm sfo-r
model snowflak mov as an optim algorithm is a rec propos ide with a straightforward form
in thi pap we propos to us diff form for the mov of the snowflak and pres a new nature-inspired optim algorithm bas on the sam phenomenon
the algorithm is bas on the forc that affect a snowflak dur the snowfal and the collid between them
we test the algorithm on three benchmark set cec 2017 cec 2020 and cec 2011 and comp it perform with pso woa bbo gwo bat and mfo in solv thes three benchmark set
we evalu the result both stat and with the wilcoxon signed-rank test
the evalu shown that the propos algorithm has well-balanced expl and exploit abl and outperform the oth algorithm for al the comparison criter exceiv the execut tim
also the pairw comparison ind that it is mor stabl than the oth algorithm in solv cec 2017 and cec 2020 benchmark problem .
