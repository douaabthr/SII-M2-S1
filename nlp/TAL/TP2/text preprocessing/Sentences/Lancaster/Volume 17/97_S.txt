a neur network approach for the solv of van der pol-mathieu-duffing oscil model
the conceiv of oscil problem find it indispens pres in num dynam system
machin learn techn for handl dynam system is a challeng and rapid expand field of research
in thi regard a machin learn approach nam symplect art neur network model has been us for handl the non-linear system ar in dusty plasm model
the prim object of thi artic is to investig the dynam of van der pol-mathieu-duffing oscil problem for diff excit funct us the meshfr symplect art neur network algorithm
the num sim and graph repres ar carry out to est the acc of the pres algorithm
also the obtain sim result ar comp with the ex num solv
in addit the stat assess study at vary test point confirm an excel agr between the pres sim result and the ex result .
