chaot veget evolv lev multipl see strategies and a mut mod for glob optim problem
thi pap focus on improv the overal perform of the veget evolv veg algorithm and propos a chaot veg with multipl see strategies and a mut mod cveg
whil the origin veg exhibit robust exploit cap it fal short in term of expl and overcom loc optim
thu we introduc the chaot loc search op multipl see dispers strategies and a un mut mod to address thes ment limit
furtherm we incorp a simpl sigmoid transf funct into cveg and propos a bin vary known as bin chaot veget evolv bcvege
in num expery we evalu cveg on 10 d 30 d 50 d and 100 d cec2020 benchmark funct as wel as four engin optim problem
addit bcvege is subject to test on two combin optim problem wrapper-based feat select task and class 0 1 knapsack problem
her we employ two class algorithm i. e
diff evolv and partic swarm optim and sev state-of-the-art competit algorithm includ the origin veg as the competit algorithm
the sufficy num expery and stat analys pract show that our propos cveg and bcvege ar competit with comp algorithm
furtherm the demonst perform and scal of cveg and bcvege suggest their pot util across a wid rang of optim task .
