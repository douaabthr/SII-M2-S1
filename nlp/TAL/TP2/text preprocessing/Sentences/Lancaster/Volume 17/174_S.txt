comparison of optim approach on linear quadr reg design for traject track of a quadrot
linear quadr reg lqr is on of the most prev method us in the control of unman aer vehic
lqr control ar common employ in the control of both linear and non-linear system due to their adv such as easy-to-apply and high-performance structure
howev ther is on main difficul that play a sign rol in the man of determin the gain for the control sign choos appropry weight mat
the select of thes mat that direct affect the control perform is gen perform by tri and er which is lab and time-consuming
accord vary optim algorithm hav been util to determin the weight mat of the lqr control
in thi pap the weight mat of the design lqr control wer obtain us standard genet algorithm diff evolv partic swarm optim and grey wolf optim algorithm
the obtain weight mat of the lqr control wer test on an unman aer vehic sim and the perform of optim algorithm wer pres comp .
