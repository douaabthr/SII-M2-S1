quantum-inspired meta-heuristic approach for a constrain portfolio optim problem
portfolio optim has long been a challeng proposit and a wid study top in fin and man
it involv select and alloc the right asset accord to the desir object
it has been found that thi nonlinear constraint problem cannot be effect solv us a tradit approach
thi pap cov and comp quantum-inspired vert of four popul evolv techn with three benchmark dataset
genet algorithm diff evolv partic swarm optim ant colony optim and their quantum-inspired incarn ar impl and the result ar comp
expery hav been carry out with mor than 10 year of stock pric dat from nasdaq bse and dow jon
thi work propos sev enh to alloc fund efficy such as improv crossov techn and dynam and adapt select of paramet
furtherm it is observ that the quantum-inspired techn outperform the class counterpart .
