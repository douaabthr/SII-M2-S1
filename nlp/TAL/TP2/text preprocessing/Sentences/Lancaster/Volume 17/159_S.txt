joint opposit select enh mountain gazel optim for brain stroke class
a sign caus of dea and long-term dis glob is brain stroke
stroke fal into on of two categ 1 ischem which account for rough 85% of cas when it is caus by abrupt cess of blood supply to a particul are of the brain and 2 hemorrh which ref to blee or blood leak
to provid stroke paty with individ therapeut car meta-heuristic algorithm mak acc and tim predict
the us of meta-heuristic algorithm and machin learn in the healthc sect is grow
a new meta-heuristic algorithm cal the mountain gazel optim mgo was develop in part as a result of wild mountain gazel soc structure but suff from slow converg spee
consequ a mod mgo mmgo approach us the joint opposit select op which combin the select lead opposit and the dynam opposit learn approach to improv mgo
the purpos of thi study is to evalu the perform of mmgo bas on the k-nearest neighb knn class in predict brain stroke in dat set tak from kaggl
perform was assess on the challeng cec 2020 benchmark test funct
comp to sev well-known optim algorithm the stat result demonst the supery of mmgo
furtherm the expery result of mmgo-knn for categ brain stroke dat set rev that it outperform competit in al dat set with an overal acc of 95.5% a sensit of 99.34% a spec of 98.99% and a precid of 99.21% .
