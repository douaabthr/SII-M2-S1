simpl u-net as a deep learn intellig med assist tool in glaucom detect
glaucom is look on as the most import caus of irremedy vis loss worldwid
ear detect of ey diseas espec glaucom is sery for prep tim med car and keep down the vis loss
in thi pap a fast seg algorithm is propos which is bas on a new simpl u-net architect for opt disc and retin vessel seg
the propos method includ a mod and reinforc structure that wil reduc the predict tim whil maintain the perform and acc at an comp level due to oth stat of the art method
for exampl for opt disc seg the propos method can seg the opt disc in 0.008 second on drions-db dataset and for vessel seg it can seg in 0.03 second on driv dataset
accord to thes result and an extend of the propos method can be us as a real-time intellig med system which abl to be impl on the us hardw equip in the ophthalmolog clin
thi method which can perform opt disc and retin vessel seg task in a short tim increas the perform of ophthalmolog in glaucom diagnos .
