3d path plan for a robot bas on improv ant colony algorithm
path plan is an import issu in the field of robot research
comp with tradit two-dimensional 2d path plan three-dimensional 3d path plan is clos to pract apply
in thi pap a new improv ant colony algorithm is propos to solv the problem of slow converg spee low efficy and the tend of fal into the loc optim solv of the tradit ant colony algorithm for the 3d path plan
ther ar three main improv step in the novel ant colony algorithm in 3d path plan
in the first step a pseudo-random stat transit strategy is adopt to ens the glob search abl of the algorithm
in the second step the pheromon upd and the pheromon incr calc method ar us to accel the converg spee of the algorithm which can ens the qual of the solv
in the end step a sec valu funct of the heur funct is us to ens the sec of path
in addit the condit fallback method is us to ens the glob search abl of the algorithm
sim result show that the new improv ant colony algorithm can find a feas three-dimensional path quick and efficy .
