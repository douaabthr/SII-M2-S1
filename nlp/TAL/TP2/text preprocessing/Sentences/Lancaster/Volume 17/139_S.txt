on the comput of delaunay triang via genet algorithm
in thi work we introduc a new approach for comput delaunay triang
delaunay triang hav num apply in geoloc commun and oth ict system or pract apply
hav avail vary typ of approach for comput such structures is rath desir from an impl and comput point of view
we adopt genet algorithm for comput delaunay triang and pres the design and evalu of our novel approach
we consid a set of point in the plan as vert and connect them with edg cre the point graph
we hav develop in c an apply framework bas on genet algorithm calleddelaunay_genetic which produc the delaunay triang structure of a giv set of point in the plan . delaunay_geneticconsiders a novel graph-based chromosome repres of desir solv cre an init pop of individ chromosomes an init gen and produc from the origin pop gen new gen of individ in each repetit of the genet process of reproduc
each new gen emerg mor robust than the prevy on
our evalu hav rev that the delaunay triang yield bydelaunay_genetic achiev an acc of 98 100% of the optim delaunay triang whil maintain good converg spee
despit it limit in comput tim and spac the propos novel approach exhibit sev compl benefit to comput geometry bas approach such as allow the insert of new point in the triang dynam lead to seamless adapt to new condit parallel of the comput process and tol to nois regard the coordin of the point
theref thi work provid a us altern approach for comput delaunay triang .
