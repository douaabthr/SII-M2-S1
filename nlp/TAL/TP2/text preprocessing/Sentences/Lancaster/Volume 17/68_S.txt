sight partic improv swarm optim by mak partic aw of their surround
population-based meta-heuristics us partic repres by d dimend point to encod candid solv to an optim problem
the goal of thi work is to introduc a new typ of partic repres by a d dimend hypercub
our new repres off a field of view to swarm partic mak them aw of their surround
thi giv each partic it own cov of the search spac
we evalu the effect of our approach in the perform of sev swarm-based algorithm includ art bee colony cuckoo search optim and partic swarm optim
we us 30 well-known benchmark funct and six diff numb of dimend
we comp the perform of the algorithm withblindandsightedpartic us mann-whitney test
the result of our extend expery show thatsightedpartic perform at least as wel asblindon in 93% of al scenario across diff algorithm benchmark funct and numb of dimend show sign bet result 51% of the tim
we also propos a new scal which meas an algorithm s expl and exploit cap and we us it to explain our result
fin we follow asightedswarm throughout the converg process show it abl to cov larg port of the search spac
our take-hom mess is that any swarm algorithm can adopt our partic repres in ord to improv it perform becaus any method can benefit from improv it exploit and expl cap .
