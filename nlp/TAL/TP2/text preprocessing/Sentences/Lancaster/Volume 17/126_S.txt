perform assess of the main metah for sustain supply chain
the sustain supply chain optim is a high-dimensional multi-objective optim problem
the involv cost can be categ as econom environ and soc
metah can be us for tackl thi kind of problem efficy
thi short not deal with a comp analys of the main metah accord to rec survey for a sustain supply chain model
the consid techn ar genet algorithm partic swarm optim sim an and non-dominated sort genet algorithm
moreov two hybrid model ar also includ i. e
genet algorithm combin with sim an and genet algorithm combin with partic swarm optim
the lat provid the best result with a constraint satisfact rat eq to 0.9968 .
