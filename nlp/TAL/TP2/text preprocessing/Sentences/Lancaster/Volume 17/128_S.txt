eleph flow detect intellig for software-defined network a survey on cur techn and fut direct
software-defined network sdn is charact by the sep of the packet forward plan from the network control plan
thi sep off an extend view of the network s stat enh network resy and man
network traff class can improv sdn control and resourc provid particul for eleph flow ef detect
ex techn for detect ef util preset thresholds and bandwid that ar inadequ for chang traff conceiv
moreov thes techn consum high dat plane-controller bandwid and hav a high detect tim
thi research first describ the rel man techn in sdn
then accord to the detect loc eleph flow detect approach ar class into four kind host-based switch-based controller-based and hybrid controller-switch-based detect
thi research examin four typ of detect approach and conclud that host-based detect prim rely on the flow stat threshold
such approach frequ gath flow stat by monit the socket buff or via the hyperv
in contrast switch-based detect can lev both the flow stat threshold and flow charact
controller-based detect techn in sdn foc on extract flow feat stat at the control level aim to reduc switch overhead whil pot increas control load
fin hybrid controller-switch-based detect combin both rout aspect off fine-grained flow control
howev it fac challeng in maintain a bal in tim acc and cost
furtherm the survey incorp rec sdn adv such as machin learning-based method program switch and real-world sdn apply in dat cent glob cont delivery network healthc and iot
fin the artic mak a comprehend comparison and put forward sev point of fut predict in term of eleph flow detect tak into account rec adv in sdn research .
