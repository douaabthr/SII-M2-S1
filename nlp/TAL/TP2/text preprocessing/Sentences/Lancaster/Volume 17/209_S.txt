a multi-task meta-learner-based ensembl for robust fac express recognit in-the-wild
fac express recognit is a top of sign interest in affect comput
howev pri dataset and study hav prim focus on recogn fac express in control environ limit their gen to real context
thu despit rec adv recogn fac express acc in wild scenario remain a challeng task
in thi work we propos an ensembl model bas on multi-task meta-learner that util a pool of cnn class whil dynam select and fus the optim ensembl in ord to recogn fac express mor effect in the wild
the suggest scheme lev the output prob of bas learn as meta-features and integr multi-label class into dynam ensembl select
as best as we know thi is the first investig of multi-task learn at the meta-learning level in the context of fac express recognit
in particul we introduc an effect meta-learner that combin the strengths of stack and dynam ensembl select
the propos approach has been evalu exhaust on sev challeng dataset includ raf-db fer2013 and ferpl and the obtain result demonst that the ensembl cnn outperform individ cnn model consist whil achiev high perform across al dataset
we furth demonst the gen of the propos approach by perform cross-dataset evalu .
