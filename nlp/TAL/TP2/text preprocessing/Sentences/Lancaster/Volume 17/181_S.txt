a hybrid optim algorithm for energy-aware multi-objective task scheduling in heterog multiprocess system
in ord to success address the multiprocess work scheduling issu a novel hybrid approach is pres in thi pap
execut a group of task on a smal numb of process is the main goal of a task scheduling method
the job scheduling issu is view as a multi-objective optim issu in thi study
the goal of thi optim challeng ar to determin the system s least energy consum and minim makesp the sum of the schedule length for each task s execut
in ord to low the process energy us the dynam volt frequ scal dvfs level has the task scheduling issu en
to determin the goal a hybrid algorithm cal hybrid grey wolf crow search optim hgwcso is suggest
the grey wolf optim gwo and crow search optim cso algorithm ar combin to cre the hgwcso algorithm
the soc structure and hunt strategy of wolv serv as the inspir for the gwo metah algorithm
the cso on the oth hand is a metah algorithm that was mot by crow clev conduc
the propos hybrid approach is put into pract us task that ar produc at random and the result of thi comparison ar class method
the propos method s sim result ar contrast with thos from fiv ex wid us method
the propos techn has also been contrast with som new cre metah algorithm us vary real-world dat set
accord to the sim result hgwcso outperform oth algorithm in term of low makesp and energy us
the propos algorithm has success improv the makesp and energy consum with a maxim of 31.07% and 58.36% respect comp to oth algorithm .
