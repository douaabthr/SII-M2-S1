swarm optim approach for the minmax regret ferm web problem with budgeted-constrain uncertain point weight
giv a set of ex point with their assocy posit weight on the plan the class ferm web problem aim to find a new point that minim the overal weight dist to the ex point
we investig in thi pap the ferm web problem with budgeted-uncertain interv point weight
the minmax regret crit is apply to ident the mean solv
we first study som structural property of the problem
then we develop an efficy algorithm to solv the correspond problem wher the swarm-oriented algorithm ar apply as subroutin
comput result show the benchmark result for thes propos method
an examin is pres on ident the minmax regret ferm web point concern est a new airport in vietnam alongsid it apply in produc transf scenario .
