adapt wideband sens scheme bas on bayes expery design
in thi pap we investig the problem of wideband sens for cognit radio
due to resourc constraint a cognit nod target at find a giv numb of spectr hol which is study und a novel wideband sens architect
spec the cognit nod can dynam foc it sens meas on diff port of contigu channel
an adapt wideband sens scheme is propos und the standard bayes expery design framework via three step 1 defin a bayes cost that incorp the numb of desir spectr hol 2 design hypothes test rul to detect access opportun and 3 ident a scheme to adapt the meas dur the sens process
in ord to facilit impl we furth propos an approxim bayes expery design scheme to reduc the comput complex
the perform gain of our wideband sens scheme is demonst via num sim .
