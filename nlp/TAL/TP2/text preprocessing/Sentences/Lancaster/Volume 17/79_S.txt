adapt fuzzy approach for load frequ control us hybrid moth flam pattern search optim with real tim valid
the intens progress in the transform of the pow grid toward a new gen pow system introduc frequ reg challeng in op which can be overcom with subst benefit from the latest robust control approach along with suit smart optim tool
addit with the adopt of smart and intellig control schemes the latest commun technolog with the extend plac of smart dev ther wil be sign grow in real-time system meas
und thi trend an adapt fuzzy pid a-flc-pid system wil play a vit rol in reduc transy tim
in thi artic a novel adapt fuzzy control architect intend for load frequ control with a suppl hybrid moth flam optim pattern search h-mfo-ps algorithm is pres
the propos approach is design to optim the control gain for the ev fit of the object funct
the hybrid algorithm smart upd the scal fact of the adapt fuzzy control by consid vary proport and integr thresholds
sim ar perform on two area hydrotherm system with the gas unit
to valid the research outcom and meas the effect of the propos architect the outcom ar comp with rec research approach and pract is test us an opal-rt setup
the sturdy of the concern approach is study with a wid rang of paramet and load condit
it is observ that the h-mfo-ps scal a-flc-pid control est supery improv in frequ reg .
