marin pred soc group optim a hybrid approach
num heur and metah algorithm inspir by nat hav been develop so far
thes algorithm hav demonst their excel in resolv challeng problem across a vary of field
howev many optim algorithm fail whil solv a complex real-world problem efficy in an independ way becaus thes problem hav a distinct search behavy as they contain num eq and ineq constraint of the linear nonlinear and non-convex typ
in thi study two optim algorithm the marin pred algorithm mpa and the soc group optim sgo algorithm ar hybrid in ord to increas their efficy and problem-solving cap to solv thi typ of problem
thi propos hybrid optim algorithm is nam as marin pred soc group optim mpsgo algorithm
thi hybrid algorithm combin the strengths of both techn to enh the efficy and effect of the optim process
it is valid through thirty benchmark funct of cec2014 and aft that 26 real-world optim problem test suit of cec 2020 from the chem and mech engin domain hav been solv
the valid result ar comp with ten state-of-art optim algorithm and real-world optim problem result is comp with bipop matrix adapt evolv strategy bp-ϵmag-es enh multi-operator diff evolv enmod lshade for constrain optim colshad cohort intellig self-adaptive penal funct ci-sapf and cohort intellig self-adaptive penal funct collid body optim ci-sapf-cbo
as mpsgo is a hybrid algorithm again we hav comp it perform with the sev best mod and improv optim algorithm
in term of converg qual and improv solv qual the sim result of mpsgo hav been shown to be competit with thos of state-of-the-art hybrid improv and adv optim algorithm prov the valid as wel as the feas of the mpsgo algorithm .
