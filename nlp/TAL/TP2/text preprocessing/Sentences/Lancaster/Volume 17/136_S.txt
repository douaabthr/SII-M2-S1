bilevel optim bas on for by diff ant specy for real-time transport plan
in a transport process dur heavy traff condit or advers weath condit has a retract impact on the cost ev if the transit path chos is optim
thi pap propos an algorithm framework for a dynam transport process us a bilevel multi-objective optim approach
dynam detect of road traff meas com at an up level and optim path estim com at the low level of the bilevel model
aggreg of multipl object traff dist and qual of the path is don to form the object funct at a low level
the intellig for behavio of diff ant specy inspir a bilevel optim model for the spec problem
the upper-level task of detect the dynam traff meas is bas on a for strategy of harvest ant which us anten contact to exchang inform with inm regard food avail
the lower-level object of determin the optim rout is bas on the pheromon trail-based commun strategy us by oth specy of ant
sim result obtain manifest the pot nat of the propos method in the real-time transport process .
