zon and rul assist recognit of meitei-mayek handwrit charact
thi pap pres a two-stage approach for an improv recognit acc of handwrit meite mayek charact
the first-stage is a cnn bas recognit

for zon id a novel method bas on the row co-ordinates of charact pres in the word is propos
an improv in the recognit acc is achiev with the two-stage approach comp to the single-stag recognit us the cnn
an improv ment in recognit acc of 3.36% is shown by our approach with a recognit acc of 91.86% .
