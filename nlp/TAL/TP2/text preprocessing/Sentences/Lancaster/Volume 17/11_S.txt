a perform sim and ver method of packet scheduling algorithm for dat stream bas on qos
in the process of network-based dat flow transmit for vary apply of inform serv ther ar som problem such as limit bandwid and unclear pri level of busy dat which affect the end-to-end rely transmit efficy becaus the system cannot perceiv the link stat
tradit parallel link redund schemes hav not funda solv the problem of invuln and rely
on the bas of sort out the demand of serv dat flow transmit thi pap propos a perform ver method of dat flow packet scheduling algorithm bas on qos to solv the problem of network delay and congest and expl a rely end-to-end serv dat flow transmit mod .
