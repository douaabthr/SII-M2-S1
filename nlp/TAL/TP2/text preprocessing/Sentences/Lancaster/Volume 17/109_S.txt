a model for optim energy man in a microgrid us bioga
a mor sustain energy matrix can be achiev through an integr approach to energy gen and end-consumer self-production
thi altern can reduc consum energy cost and en the mat and boost of distribut gen technolog
us rely cost model with smart-grid technolog en mor econom efficy energy system
prevy disregard energy solv can becom viabl solv such as elect energy gen us bioga
in thi context the contribut of thi study is threefold
first we develop a cost model of elect and mech energy gen for loc consum in microgrid-producing bioga
second we integr into the model a dual-fuel mot to gen elect energy us a vary mixt of bioga and oth fuel and the biometh upgrad system to supply the mech demand
third bas on thi model an optim energy man tool is propos
the perform of thi tool is analys through scenario sim of an ex microgrid compos of a mot engin fuel by bioga produc intern a photovolta pv system a battery bank and connect to the util
the result ind the econom adv of adopt the tool and the us of the propos model
besid the reduc elect cost it also allow analys of how each piec of equip contribut to the elect cost which can be help in fut decid about equip siz .
