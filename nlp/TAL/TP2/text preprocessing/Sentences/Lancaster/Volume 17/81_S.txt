multi-resolution analys and deep neur network architect bas hybrid feat extract techn for plant diseas id and sev estim
the crop protect techn us efficy plant diseas id ar high benef for smart agricult man which furth decreas the gap between the demand/supply of consum farm
howev an efficy feat extract techn is desir to achiev high acc least graph process and low process tim for colo im
theref thi work propos a hybrid novel feat extract techn for colo plant leaf im to overcom thes challeng
thi work is divid into two part 1
plant diseas id and 2
plant diseas sev estim
in thi techn multiresolv analys us large-scal coefficy of discret wavelet transform dwt is perform us orthogon wavelet
the orthogon wavelet such as daubechy biorthogon symlet and coiflet with appropry van mom ar util to select sign feat
then the eig decomposit of large-scal dwt-based colo im feat is util us princip compon analys pca wher on the eigenvalu with larg vary ar consid for furth feat select
sev expery ar carry out for the select of felicit sub-bands decomposit level
the deep neur network dnns architect such as alexnet resnet 101 and inceiv v3 ar incorp to class the obtain feat
the dnns op on convolv neur network which util the weight from pre-learned imagenet databas class to class vary class
the combin of dnns with transf learn and fin tun is mad to tun the paramet for bet eff
expery wer perform on the plantvil databas which contain healthy/diseased im of plant such as appl corn grap and tomato leav
a new databas is cre by capt the im of ric crop leav includ healthy and diseas leav
a tot of 8000 im ar process for diseas id
the propos techn provid 99% acc for diseas id task and 90% for diseas sev estim in the real-life ric dataset and outperform the ex techn in thi field of research .
