optim of job shop scheduling problem bas on deep reinforc learn
aim at the optim problem of minim the maxim complet tim in job shop scheduling a deep reinforc learn optim algorithm is propos
first a deep reinforc learn scheduling environ is built bas on the disjunct graph model and three channel of stat charact ar est
the act spac consist of 20 design combin scheduling rul
the reward funct is design bas on the proport rel between the tot work of the scheduled op and the cur maxim complet tim
the deep convolv neur network is us to construct act network and target network and the stat feat ar us as input to output the q valu of each act
then the act is select by us the act valid expl and exploit strategy
fin the immedy reward is calc and the scheduling environ is upd
expery ar carry out us benchmark inst to ver the algorithm
the result show that it can bal solv qual and comput tim effect and the train ag has good gen abl to the scheduling problem in the non-zero init stat .
