topolog loc approach for efficy energy man of wsn
the energy man problem is an inevit issu with the wireless sens network wsn
ther is alway a nee for an energy-conscious model for wsn that wil prolong the network lifetim dur system execut
common the wsn is distribut in nat as it is us for sev apply lik loc surveil and object track
in such a scenario energy man is ev mor crit
in thi regard we propos an energy-efficient topolog loc techn cal clock loc approach cla that ens a long lifetim of wsn by elimin recur reclust and it clust head ch select
cla follow a clock pattern-based sens deploy strategy wher the select chs play a dual rol of ch and vice-ch
it help to reduc energy consum and overhead issu
the sim result show that the outperform of the cla algorithm in comparison to low-energy adapt clust hierarchy-centralized leach-c and bas stat control dynam clust protocol bcdcp .
