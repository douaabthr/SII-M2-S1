hybrid of chao the and dragonf algorithm to maxim spat are cov of swarm robot
swarm robot show collect behavy in ord to work in mult ag scenario wher spat are cov is an emerg are of research
thi work introduc a hybrid techn for optim spat are cov
a combin of dragonf algorithm da and chaot map is propos and the entir study is carry out in two phas
in the first phas da s paramet ar meas on the bas of perc of are cov entrop and numb of pop-up threats detect
in the second phas chaot distribut is apply in swarm algorithm i. e
da along with bat algorithm and accel partic swarm optim to impl hybrid model
chaot dragonf algorithm along with chaot bat algorithm and chaot accel partic swarm optim is impl
to evalu the perform of hybrid model a comprehend comparison is drawn among the levy and chaot vert of al three swarm algorithm
it is conclud that the propos da outperform the rest
da not on show bet result for the ment met but also display uniform behavy ov multipl run .
