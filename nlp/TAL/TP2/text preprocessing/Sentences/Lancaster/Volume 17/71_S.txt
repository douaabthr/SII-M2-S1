a robust feat select method bas on meta-heuristic optim for speech emot recognit
most of the tradit feat select method do not show effect perform on speech emot recognit system
on of the rec adv in the feat select is us meta-heuristic optim algorithm
individ each algorithm play a key rol in many speech process bas apply
howev hybrid meta-heuristic ar on most impress techn in the field of feat select and optim problem
hent in thi pap propos a new robust hybrid-meta-heuristic feat select model nam as cseo fs model as to improv the acc of ser task and also reduc the burd of comput cap
in thi study we investig the perform of the propos approach us speech-based emot data-sets such as emodb and ravdess which ar prim us in the develop of human-computer interact system
the expery result confirm the supery of the propos feat select in term of class acc precid f1-score and numb of select feat
comp to state-of-the-art feat select method for ser system our expery result show us achiev 94.35% and 96.78% high-level emot recognit rat respect .
