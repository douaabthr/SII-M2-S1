the novel multi-swarm coyot optim algorithm for autom skin les seg
coyot optim algorithm coa is on of population-based swarm intellig algorithm inspir by the swarm behavy of coyot
howev coa show it effect in solv the glob optim problem it suff from prem converg and stagn in loc optim esp in a complex spac
in thi pap the multi-swarm topolog is employ wher the pop is divid into sev sub-swarms
the perform of multi-swarm coyot optim algorithm mco is evalu on a set of benchmark funct provid in the ie cec 2005 and ie cec 2017 spec sess
also it is evalu for solv multi-level thresholding problem wher 44 skin dermoscop im obatin from ph2 benchmark dataset ar us
the expery result show that employ mutli-swarm topolog can sign improv the pop divers and thu the expl abl
also the result rev that propos mco has the adv of remark stabl and high acc comp with it class vert and oth state-of-art meta-heuristic optim algorithm
addit a new skin les seg model bas on mco is propos as wel
the result illust the effect and efficy of the propos model and it can be furth us for skin diseas diagnos and tre plan .
