batch metah a migration-free framework for metah algorithm
metah hav emerg as on of the promin problem-solving methodolog to handl optim problem as they can provid good qual solv within acceiv tim limit
num study hav been conduc in the field of metah propos novel algorithm mod in the ex on etc to improv the perform of the metah framework
the multi-population or island approach is on such mod wher solv ar divid into smal subpop and migr from on subpop to anoth to shar inform
though us thi approach is oft ign due to addit paramet the burd of tun them increas tim complex addit task of decid migr policy migr ratio etc
in the pres work we hav propos a novel framework to enh the perform of ex population-based metah algorithm and nam it batch metah
the pres framework is easy to impl and understand has no migr of solv among batch and is gen in nat i. e can easy be incorp with any population-based algorithm such as a genet algorithm partic swarm optim gravit search algorithm and oth
it divid the set of solv in each it into sev batch that ar individ expos to the algorithm chos with diff paramet valu
we includ the batch approach in two well-established population-based metah genet algorithm and partic swarm optim
the approach is test ov fifteen benchmark funct fiv shift benchmark funct and three class engin problem
the result obtain confirm the bet perform of the batch approach ov it non-batch counterpart
thi approach int num assocy benefit when put to us .
