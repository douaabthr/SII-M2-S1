model analys and apply cas for complex multi-system evolv optim
a complex system is mad up of multipl rel and coupl subsystem
each subsystem has it own set of multipl constraint and object and is common found in real-world apply
biogeography-based complex system optim bbo/complex is a population-based evolv intellig paradigm that has been develop to solv complex system problem
the pap first pres the framework of the propos method that consist of within-subsystem migr cross-subsystem migr and mut op
then a theoret model of the propos method is der us markov chain and the prob transit matrix of each op along with the gen multinom theorem
the model provid exact mathem formula that predict the limit prob of optim perform for each poss pop in the propos method
addit sim result of two sampl problem which includ multipl subsystem and multipl object confirm the markov model der
fin the perform of the propos method is investig on an apply of a battery charg system and num sim show that the propos method is a prom optim method for the study complex system .
