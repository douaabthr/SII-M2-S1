glob optim condit for nonlinear optim problem
bas on the altern theorem glob optim condit for nonlinear program problem to be discuss in thi artic
first on the bas of the research of optim condit for polynom optim problem the pap consid nonlinear program ov constrain which ar not real polynom funct
and then necess glob optim condit for nonlinear program problem with non-polynomial constraint funct ar propos and sufficy glob optim condit for polynom object funct program problem with non-polynomial constraint funct ar develop by us the altern theorem
fin necess and sufficy glob optim condit for 0 1 quadr program problem ar pres .
