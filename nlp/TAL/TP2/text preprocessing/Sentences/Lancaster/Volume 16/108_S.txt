a large-scal glob optim algorithm with a new adapt comput resourc alloc mech
coop co-evolution cc algorithm is an evolv comput framework that can effect solv high-dimensional optim problem
on of the main challeng of the cc is how to alloc comput resourc to subcompon reason
theref a new adapt comput resourc alloc mech acr is propos in thi pap
acr defin the av valu of the rel chang rat of the origin problem aft each round of optim as the contribut rat of the subcompon so that the optim inform of each round can be effect us
acr also set a new threshold when the random numb is gre than the threshold the subcompon with the largest contribut rat is select for optim otherw a subcompon is random select for optim
in the ear stag of optim such a subcompon select strategy wil try to select the subcompon with a larg av contribut rat for optim to spee up the declin of the object funct whil in the lat stag of optim al compon wil be select on av to improv the comput resourc in the lat stag
fin the algorithm propos in thi pap is comp with oth algorithm on the cec 2013 benchmark funct and the expery show that the algorithm propos in thi pap has bet expery perform and is feas comp with oth algorithm .
