a new fiss fus behavior-based rao algorithm ffbbra for solv optim problem
ther ar vary problem in the engin field which can be model as an optim problem and can be solv through metah optim algorithm
in thi pap a new metah algorithm nam as fiss fus behavior-based rao algorithm ffbbra has been propos
thi new algorithm util the conceiv of metaphor-less rao algorithm and the ide of fiss fus soc behavy of spid monkey optim smo
the propos methodolog divid the entir pop into subpop and then thes subpop ar independ upd concern their loc worst and glob best candid us the ffbbra equ
the propos method has been test ov 20 unconstrain funct includ multimod unimod and fix dimend benchmark funct along with 2 constrain benchmark funct
the perform of the propos algorithm is evalu through observ of the worst solv the best solv standard devy and mean solv
converg analys is also perform
the propos ffbbra has shown good perform as observ by friedm test
thi propos algorithm is also easy util on parallel system due to it parallel work nat .
