reference-lines ste guid assign and upd for pareto-based many-objective partic swarm optim
the reference-lines-framework has been success us for develop efficy many-objective evolv algorithm
in thi pap the conceiv and methodolog of such evolv algorithm ar adapt in the parl of multi-objective partic swarm optim mopso for address the challeng of assign and upd the glob and loc guid
the propos algorithm which is refer to as rmaopso is develop via fiv mod us the framework so that a divers set of guid can be select to ste the search of mopso toward the pareto-optimal front
the mod includ glob guid assign loc and glob guid upd lin assign to the guid and swarm and evolv search for glob guid
the propos algorithm is test on dtlz and wfg test inst of 3 5 8 10 and 15 object
result obtain from rmaopso show it eff ov six multi-objective evolv and mopso algorithm from the lit .
