commun efficy optim in fed learn bas on multi-objective evolv algorithm
fed learn is an emerg technolog that can effect safeguard person inform
as oppos to tradit cent learn fed learn can avoid dat shar whil maintain glob model train
howev in the process of upd the glob model it wil consum hug cli commun resourc which hind the wid apply of thi technolog
to reduc the commun overhead without sery reduc the acc of the glob model und the fed learn framework we us decomposit bas multi-objective optim algorithm moea/d to optim the structure of the glob model
for the structure of the glob model a high scal cod method is us for cod which improv the efficy of the evolv neur network
as a comparison we us the non-dominated sort genet algorithm ii nsga ii to optim the problem und the sam condit and ver the effect of both algorithm accord to the obtain pareto solv
we ver that moea/d has bet converg when us multilay and convolv neur network as the glob model
overal moea/d can furth strengthen the structure optim of the fed learn model and reduc commun cost .
