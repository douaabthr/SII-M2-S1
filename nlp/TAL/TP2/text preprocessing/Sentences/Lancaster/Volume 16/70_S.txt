the run tim complex and wilcoxon s signed-rank stat test ar also conduc to judg the propos algorithm
in addit to the expery study theoret analys is also carry out which suggest the converg scenario of the propos schemes
thes study suggest that the design bin vert of the aef ar very efficy and compet in address difficult optim problem .
