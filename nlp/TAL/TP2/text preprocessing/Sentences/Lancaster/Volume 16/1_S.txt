a survey on dragonf algorithm and it apply in engin
the dragonf algorithm was develop in 2016
it is on of the algorithm us by research to optim an extend sery of us and apply in vary area
at tim it off supery perform comp to the most well-known optim techn
howev thi algorithm fac sev difficul when it is util to enh complex optim problem
thi work address the robust of the method to solv real-world optim issu and it deficy to improv complex optim problem
thi review pap show a comprehend investig of the dragonf algorithm in the engin are
first an overview of the algorithm is discuss
besid we also examin the mod of the algorithm
the merg form of thi algorithm with diff techn and the mod that hav been don to mak the algorithm perform bet ar address
addit a survey on apply in the engin are that us the dragonf algorithm is off
the util engin apply ar the apply in the field of mech engin problem elect engin problem optim paramet econom load dispatch and loss reduc
the algorithm is test and evalu against partic swarm optim algorithm and firef algorithm
to evalu the abl of the dragonf algorithm and oth particip algorithm a set of tradit benchmark tf1-tf23 wer util
moreov to examin the abl of the algorithm to optim large-scal optim problem cec-c2019 benchmark wer util
a comparison is mad between the algorithm and oth metah techn to show it abl to enh vary problem
the outcom of the algorithm from the work that util the dragonf algorithm prevy and the outcom of the benchmark test funct prov that in comparison with particip algorithm gwo pso and ga the dragonf algorithm own an excel perform espec for smal to intermedy apply
moreov the congest fact of the techn and som fut work ar pres
the auth conduc thi research to help oth research who want to study the algorithm and util it to optim engin problem .
