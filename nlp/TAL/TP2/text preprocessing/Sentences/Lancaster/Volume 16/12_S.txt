a random-permutation bas ga for gen travel salesm problem in imprec environ
a random-permutation techn and the feat of the genet algorithm ga ar combin togeth to develop a novel heur for solv gen travel salesm problem
her the random-permutation techn is us to find the sequ of clust of a prob solv in which a complet tour to be com
the feat of ga ar us to select the city from diff clust of the sequ
the algorithm has the abl to solv the problem in both the crisp as wel as in the imprec environ
a fuzzy membership-based select process is propos to select a solv for the mat pool
a gen comparison rul of the solv is propos to rank the pot solv of the pop in imprec environ
in the crisp environ the efficy of the propos approach is test against a set of diff benchmark test problem from gtsplib hav siz up to 226 city with 26 clust
it is observ from the expery result that the algorithm produc 100% acc result for al the benchmark test problem und consid
imprec test problem ar gen from diff benchmark crisp test problem of tsplib and ar us to test the algorithm in the imprec environ
it is also observ from the expery result that the propos approach find multipl optim path i. e mor than on path if ex for the problem in the crisp as wel as in the imprec environ .
