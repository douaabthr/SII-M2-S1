nature-inspired optimum-path forest
the optimum-path forest opf is a graph-based class that model pattern recognit problem as a graph partit task
the opf learn process is perform in a competit fash wher a few key sampl i.e. prototyp try to conqu the remain train sampl to build optimum-path tre opt
the task of select prototyp is paramount to obtain high-quality opt thu being of gre import to the class
the most us approach comput a minim span tre ov the train set and promot the sampl nearby the decid bound as prototyp
although such methodolog has obtain prom result in the past year it can be pron to overfit
in thi work it is propos a metaheuristic-based approach opfmh for the select of prototyp being such a task model as an optim problem whos goal is to improv acc
the expery result show the opfmhc reduc overfit as wel as the numb of prototyp in many situ
moreov opfmhachiev competit acc and outperform opf in the expery scenario .
