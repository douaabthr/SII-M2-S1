multi-objective evolv algorithm for vehic rout problem with tim window und uncertainty
vehic rout problem vrp ar to arrang the optim rout und the vary requir and it is becom sign in the log industry as elect commerc is ris
howev uncertainty is inevit in vrp
in thi manuscrib we consid the vrp with tim window vrptw und uncertainty
we form the robust multi-objective vrptw rmovrptw model and propos a robust optim algorithm bas on moea/d r-moead-vrp for simult optim the tot dist and the numb of vehic requir for transport
first we us the pri of the custom being serv to encod and us the defin transform approach to form the feas rout
next we employ ord crossov and exchang mut op to increas pop divers
for the new rout by reproduc we us monte-carlo test to check the feas of the rout aft ad uncertainty
for the feas rout we calc the solv robust valu bas on the defin method
fin we consid both optim and robust to form a set of high robust and rel optim solv
for ver the avail of the pres algorithm the sim expery conduc on solomon s benchmark problem comp with sev rel algorithm
expery result show that our propos algorithm can bring mor robust and non-dominated solv und uncertainty and can achiev good perform .
