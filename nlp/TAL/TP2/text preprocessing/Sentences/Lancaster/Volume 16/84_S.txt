covid-19 has spread worldwid and the world heal org was forc to list it as a publ heal emerg of intern concern
the diseas has sev impact most of the peopl becaus it affect the lung and caus sev breath problem and lung infect
differenty oth lung ail from covid-19 infect and determin the sev is a challeng process
doct can giv vit life-saving serv and support paty liv on if the sev of their condit is determin
thi work propos a two-step approach for detect the covid-19 infect from the lung ct im and determin the sev of the paty s il
to extract the feat pre-trained model ar us and by analys them integr the feat from alexnet densenet-201 and resnet-50
the covid-19 detect is carry out by us an art neur network an model
aft the covid-19 infect has been ident sev detect is perform
for that im feat ar combin with the clin dat and is class as high mod low with the help of cub support vect machin svm
by consid three sev level paty with high risk can be giv mor at
the method was test on a publ avail dataset and obtain an acc of 92.0% sensit of 96.0% and an f1-score of 91.44% for covid-19 detect and got overal acc of 90.0% for covid-19 sev detect for three class .
