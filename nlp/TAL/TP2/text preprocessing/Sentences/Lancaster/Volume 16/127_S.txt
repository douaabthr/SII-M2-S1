scenario-based passeng evacu optim with multipl travel mod in transit termin
the transit termin is dens pop plac with limit road and park capac
the contradict between supply and demand wil reduc the evacu efficy of passeng ar the transit termin
thi pap consid the evacu capac of multipl travel mod on the ar passeng at the transit termin at the sam tim regard multipl travel mod as a whol and coordin the transport capac of vary mod
a bi-objective model is propos
the first object is minim the evacu cost whil the second object is minim the numb of passeng transfer
the propos bi-objective model is transform into a single-objectiv on by linear weight method
the transform model is ess a mixed-integer linear program which is solv by lingo
to valid the valid of the propos model a cas study of beid west railway stat is pres
the result ind thi propos methodolog is rat and effect and can help passeng evacu in pract apply .
