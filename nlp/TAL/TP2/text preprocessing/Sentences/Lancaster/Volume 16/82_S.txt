dam id in structure el by grasshop optim algorithm us dynam structure behavy
tim inspect of structures is necess to prev dam progress and ens the saf and efficy of structures at the lowest cost
the ex of defect and part fail in structures is the sourc of gen fail and threats to the behavy of structures
in many cas impend fail may not be app from it appear
hent the study of structural fail is on of the ess area of research that help increas the structure s lif and control the fail of structures
thi research aim to investig an approach for detect dam in the structure espec in the plat
an efficy method util the grasshop optim algorithm goa as an optim solv is pres her to detect the multiple-damag of structural system
accel chang of a structure ar consid as a crit for dam occur
the structural dam detect problem is first transmut into a standard optim problem deal with continu vary
then the goa is util to solv the optim problem for find the sit and sev of structural dam
to assess the perform of the propos method for dam id num exampl with consid meas nois ar consid
al the result demonst the effect of the propos method for acc determin the sit and sev of multiple-damag
also the perform of the goa for dam detect comp to the diff evolv algorithm dea is confirm by a num exampl .
