evolv algorithm apply for iot ded to prec irrig system stat of the art
the world is cur undergo wat scarc problem ev if it seem to be the most abund resourc on ear
howev the freshw account is real in smal amount whil agricult produc consum 70% of the maj of wat withdraw than any oth sourc
theref in ord to preserv it the irrig op has to be optim by control efficy the wat us for irrig
for that purpos sev technolog can be apply such as the internet of thing iot technolog which can perform as decid support in the irrig process
the prec irrig system bas on iot involv sev int such as hug amount of dat and integr of larg system compon which mak it difficult to be optim analys or with determin method
for thi reason it was necess to develop stochast multi-objective optim method such as the evolv algorithm ea which can solv comply problem with a larg numb of paramet in rel
the ea may be of relev us exceiv that they introduc process tim constraint
in thi artic we aim at mak a stat of the art about the us of ea combin with iot and apply to prec irrig
we wil foc particul on their us class as wel as the man in which they hav been impl to reduc their comput tim in distribut comput architect particul thos us the cloud as wel as in hardw accel form .
