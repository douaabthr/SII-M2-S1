optim coverage-awar traject plan forauvsf efficy dat collect in underw acoust sens network
in the autonom underw vehic auv bas underw acoust sens network uasn efficy dat collect with minim delay and high throughput is a funda research challeng
most of the ex dat collect schemes usingauvs suff from unb energy consum long delay part cov and incomplet dat collect problem
to overcom thes problem thi pap propos an optim coverage-awar target nod select and traject plan scheme forauvsf fast and efficy dat collect in the underw sens network
optim select of coverage-awar target nod and traject plan of the multipleauvs propos us backtrack search optim bso techn
aft deploy of the underw sens nod first network is partit into a set of load bal cluster-region
aft that optim coverage-awar target nod is select from each cluster-region for collect of the sens dat usingauv
for optim the traject of theauv abso-based traject plan scheme is propos with novel fit funct
the propos scheme dispatch multipleauvsconcur for high avail and low delay in the dat collect from the cluster-regions
perform of the propos scheme is evalu and comp with som latest state-of-art ex schemes in term of cov ratio tot travel dist maxim travel dist delay and av energy consum
sim result confirm that the propos scheme perform wel and very cap in provid the fast and high avail of the sens dat collect fromuasn .
