wireless body are network wban is an excel platform to transf cruc heal dat from a hum body to the databas ov a publ channel
thu it is ess to protect sensit dat as an advers can interceiv commun
besid it is also vit to ver the us send and receiv bef provid dat access for heal inform
to deal with thes challeng diff mess transmit protocol ar design to check the us legitim dat correct and secrecy of inform
the big data-driven fut fabr system b ffs databas contain a lot of us dat
b ffs is group into three categ dat collect dat gath and er check

the dat com from a vary of way includ sens that collect traff heal weath and transf dat as wel as upd to vary soc network sit
research in thi work hav suggest diff dat transmit schemes for wban to enh sec whil exchang mess
they hav discuss vary feat limit and construct of ex wban dat transmit mech to clear understand the strengths and weak of the ex work
to mak it mor clear to read research in thi study hav describ diff ess sec property for wban commun
in addit research hav explain vary sec attack which can be launch dur mess transmit in wban
moreov poss countermeas ar discuss to resist the discuss attack
fin whil deal with the wban system thi survey study pres a comprehend discuss of the sec property attack and countermeas
fin thi work aid research in develop wban dat transf techn .
