detect of parkinson s diseas from handwrit us deep learn a comp study
deg disord such as parkinson s diseas pd hav an influ on dai act due to rigid of musc trem or cognit impair
micrograph speech intens and deficy gen of volunt saccad ey mov pretegian and opt in front neurol 8 592 2017 ar manifest of pd that can be us to dev noninvas and low cost clin test
in thi context we hav collect a multimod dataset that we cal parkinson s diseas multi-modal collect pdmultimc which includ onlin handwrit speech sign and ey mov record
we pres her the handwrit dataset that we cal handpdmultimc that wil be mad publ avail
the handpdmultimc dataset includ handwrit sampl from 42 subject 21 pd and 21 control
in thi work we investig the apply of vary deep learn architect nam the cnn and the cnn-blstm to pd detect through tim sery class
vary approach such as spectrogram hav been apply to encod pen-based sign into im for the cnn model whil the raw tim sery ar direct us in the cnn-blstm
in ord to train thes model for pd detect on larg scal dat vary dat aug approach for pen-based sign ar propos
expery result on our dataset show that the best perform for ear pd detect 97.62% acc is reach by a combin of cnn-blstm model train with jit and synthet dat aug approach
we also illust that deep architect can surpass the model train on pre-engineered feat ev though the avail dat is smal .
