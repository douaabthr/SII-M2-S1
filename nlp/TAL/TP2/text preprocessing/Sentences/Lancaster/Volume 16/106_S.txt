track and field train stat analys bas on accel sens and deep learn
on act of a hum is complet und the control of the relev system of body
the real of mov is complex divers and detail with flex and vary that cannot be achiev by machinery
hum mot analys and recognit is a challeng research top that play an ess rol in promot bion engin med engin sport competit and gam anim
the tradit hum mot estim method rely heavy on im seg so it may be affect by inacc seg in the process of athlet mov detect result in er in the follow analys
thi pap propos a track and field train stat recognit method bas on the accel sens and deep learn algorithm
the propos method us an accel sens to detect the acc mot inform of the hum body in real-time and a deep learn method to process and analys the dat which can provid robust dat and analys result ev in inc weath such as on rainy or snowy day
the propos method doe not rely on unst im seg or perceiv result
howev it on carry out stat analys through real-time sens dat which can provid robust analys result of track and field train
pract test show that the propos method is robust stabl and robust to sens and mot nois
at the sam tim thi method can provid mor acc mot estim and stat analys
bas on the valid of the publ dataset utd-mhad the propos method sign improv act recognit acc .
