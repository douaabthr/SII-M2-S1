the real-time target detect algorithm yolo has fast detect spee and high acc but it main disadv is the inacc posit of the build bound box and the misjudg of part overlap build object

the model is deploy on the remot sens geograph inform evalu platform to conduc vary build target detect expery
the av detect acc of the urb build can reach 81.8% and the detect spee for remot sens seg im is 26 per second
the map@0.5 of the yolov5 algorithm with the at mech is 12% high than that of the unimprov yolov5 algorithm on the urb street view im dataset .
