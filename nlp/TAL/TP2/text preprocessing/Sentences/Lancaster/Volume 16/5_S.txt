hybrid chaot system-oriented art fish swarm neur network for im encrypt
accord to the research work of the ref on chaot cryptanalys many rec chaot im encrypt algorithm cannot resist chosen-plaintext attack
although som chaot im encrypt algorithm introduc plain-image inform they stil viol som design requir of modern cryptosystem
the tradit im encrypt algorithm has the disadv of low sec and time-consuming
theref aft analys many lit rel to chaot im encrypt and aim to improv the sec of ciphertext and effect resist plaintext attack we propos a hybrid chaot system-oriented art fish swarm neur network method for im encrypt
first bas on the nonlinear combin the the log tent and sin map ar us to design the hybrid complex chaot system
accord to the pixel valu of plaintext it gen the init valu to output the chaot sequ
tak a chaot sequ as the input lay the art neur network is introduc to train and learn the chaot sequ
it elimin the chaot period and output the neur network sequ
the art fish swarm algorithm is us to optim the init weight and threshold of the elm neur network
the set obfusc method is defin to scramble the plaintext
a quant method is construct to quant the neur network sequ and obtain the key flow
the mix im ar class the key flow is combin the pixel valu is chang and the ciphertext is output by design the piecew diffus technolog
expery result show that comp with the cur state-of-the-art im encrypt method the propos algorithm has high sec and resist plaintext attack abl .
