mobl robot monocul vision-based obstac avoid algorithm us a deep neur network
in rec decad obstac avoid has been on of the main challeng in autonom vehic navig which has been us in a wid rang of diff autonom dev and it is also a funda requir for mobl robot
in thi pap a novel method is propos and evalu for mobl robot navig in an unknown environ whil avoid collid with unexpect obstac
thi mobl robot has been equip with a mono-vision sens which commun with the environ
theref the decision-making unit is entir vision-based and no oth sens is us to commun with the environ
the deep neur network method has been us to inform the robot about the suit direct of mov but cent decision-making unit wil do som preprocess on the output command bef send it to the op unit
in thi research vary techn ar investig to train the convolv neur network in a bet way to gen mor acc command for the mobl robot s mov toward the saf are without collid into any obstac
besid lot of vary method hav been us to increas the perform of the neur network
the most import on is us an adjust learn rat
the result show the vit rol of learn rat in network perform
the design network attain a 96.88% acc and a 0.14 loss which ind that thi approach could success improv the neur network perform and reason solv the obstac avoid problem .
