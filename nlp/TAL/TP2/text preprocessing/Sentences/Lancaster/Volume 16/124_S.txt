disparity-augmented traject for hum act recognit
num method for hum act recognit har hav been propos in the past two decad
many of thes method ar bas on spars repres which describ the whol video cont by a set of loc feat
traject as mid-level spars feat ar cap of describ the mov of interest point in two-dimensional 2d spac
howev 2d traject might be affect by viewpoint chang pot decreas their acc
in thi pap we first propos and comp diff 2d trajectory-based algorithm for hum act recognit
then we propos a new way of aug 2d traject with disp inform without the calc of the 3d reconstruct
our obtain har result hav shown a 2.76% improv when us disparity-augmented traject comp to us class 2d traject inform on
furtherm we hav also test our method on the challeng hollywood 3d dataset on which we hav obtain competit result at a much fast spee .
