reduc the numb of funct evalu in derivative-fr algorithm for bound constrain optim
in thi pap we pres a derivative-fr algorithm bas on mod minim posit bas for bound constrain optim problem
comp with the derivative-fr algorithm bas on the maxim 2npositive bas the algorithm bas on the minim n 1 posit bas on nee at most n 1 funct evalu at every it wher the numb of vary
theref we can reduc the numb of funct evalu from 2nto n 1 at each it
but the minim posit bas can caus undesir larg angl between som posit bas direct and larg unexpl feas domain
in ord to overcom thi defect we propos a mod set of feas direct bas on the minim posit bas and the techn of search direct rot to investig the unexpl domain at the next it
accord converg to stat point is prov
moreov the num expery show that the method bas on mod minim posit bas can reduc the numb of funct evalu and is benef in a derivative-fr context .
