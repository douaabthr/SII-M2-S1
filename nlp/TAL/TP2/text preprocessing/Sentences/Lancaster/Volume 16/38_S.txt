adapt deep q learn network with reinforc learn for crim predict
crim predict model ar very us for the pol forc to prev crim from hap and to reduc the crim rat of the city
ex crim predict model ar not efficy in handl the dat imb and hav an overfit problem
in thi research an adapt drqn model is propos to develop a robust crim predict model
the propos adapt drqn model includ the apply of gru instead of lstm unit to stor the relev feat for the effect class of sacramento city crim dat
the stor of relev feat for a long tim help to handl the dat imb problem and irrelev feat ar elimin to avoid overfit problem
adapt ag bas on the mdp ar apply to adapt learn the input dat and provid effect predict
the reinforc learn method is apply in the propos adapt drqn model to select the optim stat valu and to ident the best reward valu
the propos adapt drqn model has an mae of 36.39 which is bet than the ex recur q-learning model has 38.82 mae .
