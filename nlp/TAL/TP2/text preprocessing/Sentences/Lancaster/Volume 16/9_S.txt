a chant constrain program model and an improv larg neighb search algorithm for the elect vehic rout problem with stochast travel tim
the elect vehic rout problem evrp is an extend to the well-known vehic rout problem vrp wher the fleet consist of elect vehic which may nee to visit recharg stat whil serv the custom due to their battery capac
thi pap solv the elect vehic rout problem with stochast travel tim evrpst by propos a chant constrain program ccp model as wel as a new scheme bas on an improv larg neighb search il algorithm and a mont carlo sampl mcs proc
the propos approach is first test in the determin environ us the evrp benchmark dat set wher the num result show that thi approach is abl to provid evrp optim solv within a very short comput tim for 39 out of 48 us benchmark inst with 20 50 75 and 100 custom
thereaft to show the efficy of the propos approach for solv the ccp model of the evrpst oth test ar perform on the sam set of inst whil tak into consid a larg numb of scenario .
