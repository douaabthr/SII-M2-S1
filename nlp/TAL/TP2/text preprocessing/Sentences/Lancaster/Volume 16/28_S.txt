a hybrid metah method for solv resourc constrain project scheduling problem
resourc constrain project scheduling problem rcpsp is a renown vary of the scheduling problem
rcpsp is very import in produc and man but comput hard
it is wid us in many field lik job shop scheduling flow shop scheduling transact plan wireless commun etc
the object of solv rcpsp is to obtain minim makesp maintain al constraint
ther ar som exact approxim heur and metah algorithm which wer propos to solv thi problem
rcpsp is an np-hard problem
chem react optim cro is a pop bas metah method to solv such problem and it show bet perform comp with som oth ex algorithm
cro expl the larg search spac both loc and glob us it four op
genet algorithm ga is also a nat inspir algorithm which is us to solv vary optim problem
in thi pap we ar propos a hybrid metah approach that integr chem react optim cro and genet algorithm ga nam cro-ga to solv rcpsp
we hav redesign the bas op of cro and ga to find out the solv
an addit op cal pri bas select op is us in cro to adjust with ga
our propos method is comp with oth rel approach such as adapt partic swarm optim a-pso mult ag optim algorithm mao art bee colony abc genet algorithm ga which ar stat of the art for the rcpsp
the expery result show that our propos methodolog giv bet result than oth ex algorithm to solv rcpsp with less comput tim .
