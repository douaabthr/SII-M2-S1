mod gen advers network for im class
in the im class task the ex neur network model hav insufficy abl to charact the feat of the class object which lead to the problem of low recognit acc
theref we propos a mod gen advers network gan for im class
bas on the tradit gen advers network by construct multipl gen model and introduc collab mech the gen model can learn from each oth and mak progress togeth in the train process to improv the fit abl of the model for real dat and furth improv the class qual
fin a gen advers network is design to gen the occlud sampl so that the model has good robust for the occlud object recognit
the top-1 er rat is us as the evalu index
the expery ar conduc on the publ dat set contain cifar10 cifar100 imagenet2012
the comparison expery result show that the propos method can improv the feat repres abl of the gan and improv the acc of im class
the av acc is high than 90% and the er rat is low than 1.0% .
