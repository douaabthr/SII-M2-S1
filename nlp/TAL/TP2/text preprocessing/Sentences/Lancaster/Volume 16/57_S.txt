bat competit swarm optim en dmn for autom recommend of learn object
the e-learning recommend system in the learn academy is progress grow with respect to the prefer delivery mod as it deleg learn anywh anytim
in gen e-learning system fail to satisfy the nee of the individ learn with respect to their profil
thi research focus on design an autom recommend approach for the learn us the propos optim algorithm nam bat competit swarm optim bcso
init the e-learning cont ar ad into on learn reposit wher the learn object ar upload man as wel as dynam
the web crawl is us for the autom cont prep by input the par link with the restrict rul list
thereaft the categ of the e-learning object is don on the bas of typ top and prep method us interv type-2 fuzzy loc enh bas rough k-means clust autom
ont the e-learning top ar categ the autom recommend of learn object to the us is carry out by deep maxout network dmn
her the train of dmn is perform bas on bcso which is dev by the combin of bat algorithm with competit swarm optim
furtherm the perform of the develop approach is analys and comp with the ex method
the analys depict that the propos method has the precid of 0.941 recal of 0.941 and f-measure of 0.938 .
