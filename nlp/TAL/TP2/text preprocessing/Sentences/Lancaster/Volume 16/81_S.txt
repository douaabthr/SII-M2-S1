optim centroid model approach for many-feature dat structure predict
dat clust is a popul machin learn techn wid apply for dat structure analys
among the maj techn fuzzy co-clustering fcoc is known for the cap of complex dat process such as many feat larg siz and uncertainty
in som cas fcoc has demonst supery perform ov som tradit clust method
howev fcoc has som limit such as being sensit to the init clust cent and being stuck at loc optim valu
partic swarm optim pso is a multidisciplin optim algorithm
pso was us to find a suit init clust cent solv for the clust algorithm
howev pso is limit and unclear espec for algorithm with complex structures and many paramet
in thi pap we propos a new fuzzy co-clustering algorithm by us the optim solv of the pso algorithm to find the init centroid for the fcoc algorithm
we cal the new algorithm fcocm
in our expery we us symbol and mathem langu to describ the process of find init centroid cal the optim centroid model ocm
thu our work propos two new contribut includ the ocm model and the fcocm algorithm
expery wer conduc on benchmark dat set from the uc machin learn reposit and the school of the comput univers of eastern finland to demonst the supery perform of the propos method .
