protein remot homolog detect combin pca and multiobject optim tool
protein remot homolog detect prhd is on of the intens research and a complex problem in comput biolog
the object of prhd is to predict the structural and funct charact of un-annotated protein sequ by mean of homolog
two sequ ar said to be homolog if ther ex a shar ancestry between them
it aim to detect the evolv rel among protein sequ that ar dist loc via comput techn
predict of funct of protein sequ ar comput intend
feat extract from protein sequ ar too high and pres of insign redund feat degrad the perform of comput model with respect to tim and cost
hent us princip compon analys pca the high dimend input matrix was transform into a low dimend matrix
in the first stag for each protein sequ 531 physico-chemical property from aaindex databas ar consid as feat for homolog detect
the protein sequ ar tak from protein famy from uniprotkb databas
a set of 185 repres feat hav been extract from 531 feat us pca
in the second stag nsga ii and nsga ii two pow optim techn ar us to efficy search the non-zero eig spac and retriev distinct eig vect
thi work is test on wid us uniprot and scop benchmark dataset
to check the efficy of both the algorithm the control paramet ar kept sam and num sim wer perform
nsga-iii outperform nsga-ii in the result .
