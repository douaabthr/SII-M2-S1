evalu method of outward-bound bas on neur network
outward-bound is of gre sign in phys educ
how to us the neur network model for the outward-bound evalu in ord to provid train and train with train paramet that can be refer to for each extend exerc
thi not on evalu the effect of each stretch but also quant vary met of each stretch such as saf efficy train intens and mor
in thi pap we propos an evalu model for outward-bound bas on the neur network which is a comput intellig method to provid train and train with train paramet that can be refer to for each extend exerc
first we analys and categ diff typ of outreach program
second we extract diff ind as feat dat accord to the learn process of outbound train
third we adopt the pow learn abl of a neur network to mak evalu analys
fin we expery ver the effect of the propos method .
