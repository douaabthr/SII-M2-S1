genet algorithm bas bi-objective optim of sigmoid util and throughput in ad-hoc wireless network
with the rapid grow of ad-hoc wireless technolog amidst the hug demand of high data-rates the simult optim of overal network throughput and utility-proportional resourc alloc is of utmost sign
the design of infrastructure-less ad-hoc wireless network with high dynam op condit can be intellig model by us the art intellig algorithm and machin learn techn
in thi work we employ the meta-heuristic comput method of genet algorithm for multi-criterion optim of sigmoid util maxim and throughput efficy
