optim reconfig of distribut network fee consid elect vehic and distribut gen
penet of elect vehic and distribut gen resourc in distribut network is increas and it is nee to investig their effect on system s op scheme rely
but the simult pres of elect vehic and distribut gen resourc requir metic plan becaus lack of access to an apply can reduc the lifetim of thes technolog lead to multipl blackout in the pow grid
theref thi study propos the dynam distribut network reconfig in the pres of distribut gen unit and elect vehic with vary object funct includ energy loss op cost and energy not supply
moreov the tim of us mech as a demand respons apply is introduc to enh the pow us of subscrib
in ord to gen the propos approach tim vary elect pric and diff load level ar consid to provid acc produc plan of distribut gen resourc and elect vehic in the real spac of the elect network
the inh complex of the distribut fee reconfig problem has mad the pres of solv techn a top of ongo research
theref a hybrid improv partic swarm optim art bee colony optim algorithm has been pres to allevy the complex of the optim problem
the res method is test on the 95 bus system and a comparison is drawn between it outcom and that of oth method includ partic swarm optim art bee colony optim and enh gravit search
the review of the result manifest that the propos method is supery to oth evolv algorithm .
