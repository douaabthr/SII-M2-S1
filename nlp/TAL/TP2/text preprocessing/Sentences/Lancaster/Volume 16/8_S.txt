loc neighbo spid monkey optim algorithm for dat clust
dat clust play a cruc rol in the analys of inform collect from a vary of domain
research develop many class and mathem algorithm to solv real-life problem but due to the inh property of thes algorithm they prem converg and fal to loc optim
a furth pattern of dat in term of shap siz and distribut has a sign effect on the exploit and expl charact of algorithm which draw at to many research
thi work attempt to solv thi problem by propos an lnsmo loc neighbo spid monkey optim algorithm for dat clust
in the propos algorithm loc lead phas of the spid monkey optim algorithm is improv with it neighbo solv
furth to enh the glob search glob lead phas of spid monkey optim is improv with a chaot op
the perform of lnsmo is comp with elev real-life dataset with fiv well-known meta-heuristic algorithm in term of a sum of within-cluster dist and converg spee
it is furth comp with rec develop hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm
expery result demonst that the propos algorithm provid a bet result in term of acc f-measure and swcd .
