multi-class autoencoder-ensembled predict model for detect of covid-19 sev
coronavir pandem has hamp hum lif al ov the world with sev sery casual and num deceas cas
though the pac of the pandem slow down ow to the vaccin process stil new mut vary of the vir continu to evolv
our research aim on develop an autoencod ae bas multi-class predict model for detect the sev of coronavir
our propos model is bas on certain symptom such as fev dry cough fatigu difficul in breath ach sor throat nas congest diarrhe etc
our ai driv predict model can efficy ident distinct class of sev which includ no-infection mild mod and sev cas wher a paty may requir intend med car
we hav consid machin learn model includ log regress support vect machin and decid tre and recur deep neur network model for perform comparison with propos autoencod ae bas model
our autoencoder-based log regress decid tre and support vect machin improv the predict perform and acc toward anticip the spread of coronavir
it has been observ that ae-based deep learn model outperform som of the ex machin learn and deep learn techn with a maxim acc of 99.66%
hent ae-based model wer found to be mor suit for multi-class predict of large-scal patient-centric dat in term of f1-score acc precid recal model test train loss and oth valid stat .
