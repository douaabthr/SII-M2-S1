an efficy metah method bas on the bittor commun protocol em-bt
in the last few year consid at has been paid to metah techn to solv hard optim problem as they can produc adequ solv with less comput complex
in thi pap an efficy metah techn bas on the bittor commun protocol em-bt is propos
our em-bt algorithm us the sam conceiv of the bittor commun protocol to am the commun between the candid solv and man the way inform is exchang between them in ord to provid sufficy expl and exploit of the search spac
the pres algorithm is evalu on a group of 23 class benchmark funct defin in cec 2005 and 10 funct defin in cec-c06 2019
the result show that our algorithm outperform in many funct oth metah such as partic swarm optim pso grey wolf optim gwo butterf optim algorithm boa salp swarm algorithm ssa whal optim algorithm woa jay algorithm diff evolv de and genet algorithm ga
the diff between the solv obtain with our em-bt method and the glob optim solv is very smal up to 1 tim 10 16 with a low standard devy which prov the acc stabl and supery of the propos method .
