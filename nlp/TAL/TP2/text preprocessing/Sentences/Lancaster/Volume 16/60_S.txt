a novel arithmet optim algorithm bas on chaot map for glob optim
chaot map ar effect in develop evolv algorithm ea to avoid loc optim and spee converg
becaus of thi cap of chaot map thes map hav been hybrid with vary optim algorithm
in thi study a new optim method bas on the combin of chaot map and arithmet optim algorithm cao is propos
ao repres the behavy of four bas arithmet op
theref ao perform the optim process in a wid search spac with it mathem model
theref ao has an effect converg cap
in addit ten diff chaot map ar apply on the ao
in thi study 7 scenario wer cre with chaot map tak into account diff phas of ao
the propos cao is test on eighteen benchmark problem
cao produc success and prom result in solv optim problem comp to origin ao algorithm
the propos cao is also comp with the origin ao
the supery aspect of cao ov ao ar discuss
cao converg perform is also discuss
the stat sign of the propos hybrid algorithm is test with the wilcoxon sign-rank method .
