a gen scheme for cyb sec in resourc constraint network us incomplet inform gam
we propos an onlin learn model that efficy teach a defend s ag to learn the attack s behavy whil interact in the cyber-world
thi pap model the interact between thes two ag as a stochast gam with limit rat
becaus of thi limit rat the propos model help the defend s ag learn the unknown commun s behavy from the feedback obtain whil interact with it
many model ar built to solv the interact between them by develop a state-oriented stochast markov gam
howev such model fail due to the stat explod problem and theref thi pap discuss a model to solv thi gam restrict it to a stateless stochast gam
the model is then comp to check the perform with diff algorithm that solv stochast gam
the comparison between them show that the propos algorithm converg to an optim strategy in a brief sim tim span
fin our model check the perform with an ex techn that show that the propos algorithm choos the correct strategy for around 91% of the sim tim comp to 73% of the sim tim by the ex algorithm .
