a new approach bas on expon entrop with mod kernel fuzzy c-means clust for mri brain seg
im clust is on of the most import and challeng process of digit im process and comput vis ref to partit an im into mean reg
in med im the seg of anatom magnet reson im mri is a cruc step to a multitud of apply includ computer-aided diagnos monit of cant patholog morphomet analys and vis of hum tissu
unfortun mr im contain intens inhomog and nois produc by the scan tool can lead to inacc and unrely result seg
in thi context we propos a robust and efficy fuzzy clust method cal mod kernel with expon entrop mk2e which is introduc by mod the kernel fuzzy c-means method and by incorp the fuzzy expon entrop and a logarithm penal term
