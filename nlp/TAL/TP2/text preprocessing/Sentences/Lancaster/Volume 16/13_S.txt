invers problem bas multiobject sunflow optim for structural heal monit of three-dimensional truss
abstracttruss-type structures ar wid us in engin with sev apply in diff sect such as construct aeronautics/aerospace telecommun and energy field
in al thes situ they ar gen large-scal structures pos difficul to tak adv of som direct inspect techn to loc and ident structural dam
in cas thes inspect ar not perform prop the lik of occur of accid wil be very high
in thi sens structural heal monit techn bas on the us of optim algorithm appear as a prom and non-destructive methodolog
in thi study an invers dam id problem is form and solv in ord to ident dam in large-scal lattice-typ structures
the direct problem is num form us finit el method consid a 72 bar truss wher the mod respons is obtain
a rec new metah sunflow optim algorithm is us to solv the invers dam problem form in term of multipl dam sit and two independ object funct bas on nat frequ and mod shap
num result hav shown that the includ of mod shap in a multiobject form improv the abl to acc ident the dam in term of it loc and sev
the multi-object sfo algorithm show result strictly supery to the nsgaii . graph abstract
