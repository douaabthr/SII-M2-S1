evolv approach for the weight anti-covering loc problem
giv a set of pot facil loc sit along with a posit weight assocy with each sit as per it import the anti-covering loc problem aclp is about loc a set of facil at som of thes pot loc such that no two facil ar clos than a giv dist from each oth and sum of weight of chos loc is as larg as poss
thi mathc np hard problem has sev import real-world apply such as telecommun equip sit loc milit unit loc franch outlet loc obnoxy facil forest man and dna sequ match
ther ar weight and unweight vert of aclp
the unweight vert of aclp is wid study in the lit
howev the weight vert did not receiv much at despit sev real-world apply
in thi pap we hav propos two evolv approach bas on genet algorithm ga and discret diff evolv dde to solv the weight vert of the aclp
the propos approach ar us to solv the 80 aclp inst with upto 1577 pot sit
comput result show the effect of our approach .
