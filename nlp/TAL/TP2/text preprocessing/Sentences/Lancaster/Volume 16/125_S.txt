a two-stage rout optim model for yard trail in contain termin und stochast demand
the rout optim of yard trail in contain termin is an import issu for vehic dispatch
wheth the vehic dispatch is reason wil determin the circ efficy of the contain termin
in ord to bet optim the yard trail rout und stochast demand a two-stage optim model is est in thi pap consid the constraint of vehic capac and travel dist which aim at plan and determin the travel rout of the trail and the op sequ
to solv the two-stage optim model a partic swarm optim algorithm pso algorithm with expon decreas weight strategy is introduc to search for a satisfy solv to ens the feas of distribut plan and vehic rout
and the optim result of the sim expery rev that satisfy solv can be obtain by employ the two-stage optim model construct in thi pap which furth ver the feas and valid of the optim model and algorithm
the two-stage optim model provid a pract and effect method to solv the trail rout dispatch in contain termin und stochast demand .
