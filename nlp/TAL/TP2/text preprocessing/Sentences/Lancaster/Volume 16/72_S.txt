apply machin learn to enh the cach perform us reus dist
the mot for the search of efficy cach man policy is due to the drawback of the larg numb of cpu cyc tak to fetch a block from the main mem to the last level cach
rec research ar us most rec adv in machin learn ml to optim the perform of cach
they design diff model us ml techn to improv the perform of cach
unfortun the schemes suff from sev drawback lik stor complex incur whil stor the extr bit requir for predict excess tim requir for predict increas in difficul of reus predict when workload ar increas increas in energy consum dur the predict process and lack in achiev expect acc
in ord to overcom thes drawback cach reus predict is analys us class problem which is act view of the learn problem
the vit paramet us ar the frequ of access and reus dist in which the lat is model as stack dist
as an innov ide reus dist is calc bas on stat of each block into account
in addit num nat of the dataset us in thi artic help in expl of the ensemble-based ml which is less frequ expery into the context of cach mem rath than the deep learn approach
by apply suit plac model the mem ref with high reus cap ar fetch into the cach
they ar predict with the aid of class and cross-validation on the feat set which improv the acc and sensit by 6.2% and 5.46% respect when comp to the ex work .
