thi pap propos an ensembl deep learn system for the ear detect of breast cant
unlik tradit ensembl learn that process the whol im the propos system process on the suspect nod reg snrs extract us an optim dynam thresholding method wher the threshold vary correspond to the detail of each input im
the snrs afford bet perform and off the abl to detect smal siz nod
the ensembl is compos of four transf learn convolv neur network cnns i.e. alexnet resnet-50 resnet-101 and densenet-201
a bin support vect machin svm follow each cnn model to provid eith a malign or a benign scor
to obtain the fin system decid the first-order moment is der ov the four bin output of the ensembl cnns and the fin decid is guid by the four cnns train acc
