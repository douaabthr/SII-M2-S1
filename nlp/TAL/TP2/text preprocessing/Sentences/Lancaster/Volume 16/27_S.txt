design of deer hunt optim algorithm for acc 3d indo nod loc
indo loc is on of the emerg technolog in loc bas serv which find us for commerc as wel as civil industry
glob posit system ar a famili solv for outdo loc system
but the pres of comply obstac in build pos a maj challeng in indo loc
though few indo loc techn bas on rang and fingerprint bas techn ar dev they ar tim consum and lab
theref thi pap dev an efficy deer hunt optim algorithm with weight least squ estim dhoa-wlse techn for acc 3d indo nod loc techn
the propos dhoa-wlse techn has the abl to accompl minim loc er with least loc tim
in dhoa-wlse techn the dho is us to estim the prim target loc to elimin the non-line of sight er
bas on the prim loc attain the wlse techn is apply to determin the acc target s fin loc
in ord to valid the 3d indo loc perform of the dhoa-wlse techn an extend sim analys is perform and the result ar investig in term of diff meas
the sim outcom demonst the supery perform of the dhoa-wlse techn ov the rec stat of art techn .
