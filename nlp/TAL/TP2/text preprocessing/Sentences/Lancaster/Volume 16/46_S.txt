diagnos of covid-19 us chest x-ray im bas on mod darkcovidnet model
coronavir diseas also known as covid-19 is an infecty diseas caus by sars-cov-2
it has a direct impact on the up and low respir tract and threatened the heal of many peopl around the world
the latest stat show that the numb of peopl diagnos with covid-19 is grow expon
diagnos posit cas of covid-19 is import for prev furth spread of the diseas
cur coronavir is a sery threat to sci med expert and research around the world from it detect to it tre
it is cur detect us revers transcrib polymeras chain react rt-pcr analys at the most test cent around the world
yet know the rely of a deep learn bas med diagnos is import for doct to build confid in the technolog and improv tre
the goal of thi study is to develop a model that autom ident covid-19 by us chest x-ray im
to achiev thi we mod the darkcovidnet model which is bas on a convolv neur network cnn and plot the expery result for two scenario bin class covid-19 vers no-findings and multi-class class covid-19 vers pneumon vers no-findings
the model is train on mor than 10 thousand x-ray im and achiev an av acc of 99.53% and 94.18% for bin and multi-class class respect
theref the propos method demonst the effect of covid-19 detect us x-ray im
our model can be us to test the paty via cloud and also be us in situ wher rt-pcr test and oth opt ar t avail .
