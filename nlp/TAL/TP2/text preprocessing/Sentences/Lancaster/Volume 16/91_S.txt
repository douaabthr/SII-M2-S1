a self-learning partic swarm optim algorithm with multi-strategy select
partic swarm optim has been wid util to tackl vary real optim problem as an effect and simpl optim approach
howev the phenomenon of prem converg has alway ex
to am the drawback a self-learning partic swarm optim algorithm with multi-strategy select mslspso is propos in thi study
in mslspso an elit partic guid strategy is propos
thi strategy mak elit partic particip in the search process to strengthen the guid of the pop
a lévy flight perturb strategy is design which util the random walk charact of lévy flight to perturb the hist and glob optim of partic increas the divers of the pop
in addit a fit dist correl self-learning mech is propos which can self-learning accord to the charact of the pop in the search process
a set of test funct ar util for expery analys and comp with four well-known pso vary
expery result show that the mslspso algorithm has efficy robust and competit solv can be obtain .
