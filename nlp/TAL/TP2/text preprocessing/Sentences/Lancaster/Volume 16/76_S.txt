hybrid machin learn method combin with comput vis approach to estim biophys paramet of past
with pop grow the search for technolog that en improv in produc respect the environ and peopl s heal has becom an ess point for socy
in thi context thi pap pres a study bas on comput vis techn and machin learn ml to extract inform from pasturespanic maximumcv
brs zur to assist in the man and research on past condit possibilitando a obtenção de informaçõ da
comput vis approach ar us to extract biophys paramet from im acquir orthogon from the canop of veget
the extract inform serv as input for machin learn ml method to predict past height and biomass
the contribut of thi pap is develop a poss new solv comp to tradit method in the large-scal study of plant biophys paramet which can be lab and cost and sometim depend on destruct harvest
for thi three techn wer us support vect regress multi-layer perceptron mlp and least absolv shrinkage and select
in addit the diff evolv techn was us to select the best model
thirty independ run of the diff evolv techn wer perform to assess the approach s perform
the cross-validation method result show the mlp obtain the best result reach an av of coefficy of determin r 2 eq 0.496 to estim biomass and 0.656 to estim the past height .
