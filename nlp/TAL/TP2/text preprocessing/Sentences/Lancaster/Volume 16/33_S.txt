an improv monarch butterf optim bas mult fuzzy tim sery approach for forecast gdp of ind
gross domest produc gdp is a cruc ind to evalu nat econom develop of a nat and the stat of the macro-economy of a country
in the pres work we hav propos a novel approach for predict ind s nomin gdp
six new vary hav been consid to predict the gdp of ind for which a hybrid model compr of the mult fuzzy tim sery mvfts model and the monarch butterf optim mbo algorithm is us
mbo is us to determin the optim leng of interv in the univers of discours uod whil keep the numb of interv const
the acc of the result algorithm is determin by tak the meas mean absolv perc er map and root mean squ er rmse
the outcom obtain show that the propos mvfts-mbo algorithm outperform the ex method for the predict of ind s gdp .
