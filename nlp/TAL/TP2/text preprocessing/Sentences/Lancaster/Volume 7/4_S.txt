reconstruct biolog gen reg network wher optim meet big dat
the import of big dat in biolog is increas as vast quant of dat ar being produc from high-throughput expery
techn such as dna microarray ar provid a genome-wid pict of gen express level allow us to investig the structure and interact of gen network in biolog system
inf of gen reg network grn is an underdetermin problem suit to metah algorithm which can op on limit inform
thu grn inf off a platform for investig into dat intend sci and larg scal optim problem
her we examin the link between dat intend research and optim problem for the revers engin of grns
brief we detail the benefit of the dat delug and the study of al for model grns as wel as their reconstruct
we discuss how metah can solv big dat problem and the inf of grns off real world problem for both area of research
we overview som cur reconstruct algorithm and investig som model and comput limit of the inf process and suggest som area for develop
furtherm we ident link and synergy between optim and big dat e.g. dynam uncertain and larg scal optim problem and discuss the pot benefit of mult and many-objective optim
we stress the import of dat integr techn in ord to maxim the dat avail particul for the cas of infer grns from microarray dat
such multi-disciplinary research is vit as biolog is rapid becom a quantit dat intend sci .
