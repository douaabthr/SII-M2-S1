the distribut co-evolution of an on-board sim and control for swarm robot behavio
we investig the real gap spec the environ correspond of an on-board sim
we describ a novel distribut co-evolutionary approach to improv the transf of control that co-evolve with an on-board sim
a novel of our approach is the the pot to improv transf between sim and real without an explicit meas between the two domain
we hypothes that a vary of on-board sim environ model across many robot can be competit exploit by comparison of the real control fit of many robot
we hypothes that the real control fit valu across many robot can be tak as ind of the vary fit in environ correspond of on-board sim and us to inform the distribut evolv an on-board sim environ model without explicit meas of the real environ
our result demonst that our approach cre an adapt rel between the on-board sim environ model the real world behavio of the robot and the stat of the real environ
the result ind that our approach is sensit to wheth the real behavio perform of the robot is inform on the stat real environ .
