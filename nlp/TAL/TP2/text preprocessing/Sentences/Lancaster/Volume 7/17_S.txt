improv of the perform of the quantum-inspired evolv algorithm structures pop op
pop divers is very import in giv the algorithm the pow to expl the search spac and not get trap in loc optim
in thi respect us a prob repres for the quant individ the quantum-inspired evolv algorithm qie claim high divers in the pop
her consid thi import feat of qie we propos diff structures to off bet interact between the q-individuals and propos new op to preserv the divers in the pop and thu improv the perform of the qie
the effect of the structured pop is investig on the perform of the algorithm
addit two op ar propos in thi pap
being cal the divers preserv qie the first op find the converg simil q-individuals around a loc optim and whil keep the best q-individuals by reinit the infery on push them out of the basin of attract of the loc optim so help the algorithm to search oth reg in the search spac
the oth op is a reinit op which by reinit the whol pop help it escap from the loc optim it is trap in
by study the effect of the paramet of the propos op on their perform we show how the propos op improv the perform of qie
expery ar perform on knapsack trap and fourteen num object funct and the result show bet perform for the propos algorithm than the origin vert of qie .
