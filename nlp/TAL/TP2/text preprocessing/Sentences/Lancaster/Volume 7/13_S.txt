toward the evolv of vertical-axis wind turbin us supershap
we hav rec pres an init study of evolv algorithm us to design vertical-axis wind turbin vawt wherein candid prototyp ar evalu und fan gen wind condit aft being phys instanty by a 3d print
that is unlik oth approach such as comput fluid dynam sim no mathem form ar us and no model assum ar mad
howev the repres us sign restrict the rang of morpholog expl
in thi pap we pres init expl into the us of a simpl gen encod known as giel superformul that produc a high flex 3d shap repres to design vawt
first the target-based evolv of 3d artefact is investig and subsequ init design expery ar perform wherein each vawt candid is phys instanty and evalu und fan gen wind condit
it is shown poss to produc very clos match design of a numb of 3d object through the evolv of supershap produc by giel superformul
moreov it is shown poss to us art phys evolv to ident novel and increas efficy supershap vawt design .
