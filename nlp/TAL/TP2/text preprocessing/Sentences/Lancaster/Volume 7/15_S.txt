adv genet algorithm approach to field program gat array plac with enh recombin op
sint their inceiv field program gat array hav seen an enorm grow in us becaus they can dram reduc design and manufact cost
howev the tim requir for plac a key step in the design is domin the compil process
in thi pap we tak som init theoret step toward develop an efficy genet algorithm for solv the plac problem by develop suit recombin op for perform plac
accord to holland when the genet algorithm recombin two par genotyp the diff between them defin a genotyp subspac and any offspr produc should be confin to thi subspac
thos recombin op that viol thi principl can direct a search away from the reg contain the par genotyp and thi is cont to the intend task for recombin
thi is oft detry to search perform
thi pap contribut the develop of an intuit vis techn that can be us to easy detect viol of the prevy principl
the eff of the propos methodolog is demonst and it is demonst that many standard recombin op viol thi principl
the methodolog is then us to guid the develop of novel op that exhibit subst and stat sign improv in perform ov standard recombin op .
