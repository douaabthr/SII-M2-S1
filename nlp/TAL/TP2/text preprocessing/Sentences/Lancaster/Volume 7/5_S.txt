evolution-in-materio evolv comput in mat
evolution-in-materio eim is the manip of a phys system by comput control evolv cce
it tak the posit that to obtain us funct from a phys system on nee to apply high spec phys sign and plac the system in a particul phys stat
it argu that cce is an effect methodolog for doing thi
on of the pot adv of thi is that art evolv can pot exploit phys effect that ar eith too complex to understand or hitherto unknown
eim is most common us as a methodolog for implementingcomputationin phys system
the method is a hybrid of analog and class comput in that it us class comput to program phys system or analog dev
thu far eim has on been attempt in a rath limit set of phys and chem system
thi review pap examin past work rel to eim and discuss hist underpin behind such work
it describ latest develop giv an analys of the adv and disadv of such work and the challeng that stil remain .
