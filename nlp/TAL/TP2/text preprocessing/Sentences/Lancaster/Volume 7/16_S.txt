coop coevolv algorithm for dynam optim an expery study
in thi pap we study the coop coevolv algorithm ccea for dynam optim
we introduc the ccea with two popul typ of individ 1 random immigr ris that increas the divers for chang environ and 2 elit individ that increas the loc converg to the optim
the ccea ar evalu on a standard suit of benchmark problem and ar comp with evolv strategies es
our expery result show that the ccea ar efficy in loc and track optim in dynam environ
they ar supery to the es when the ri individ and the elit individ ar us
in addit we empir investig how the ccea perform with diff paramet set
thes set includ collab method the us of plu comm select and the numb of ri individ and elit individ
we also investig the ccea that us a mutativeσ-self adapt
the ccea perform the best when they us the best collab method and the plu select
the us of the mutativeσ-self adapt is insign
our result also show that the ccea ar mor scal than the es in dynam environ .
