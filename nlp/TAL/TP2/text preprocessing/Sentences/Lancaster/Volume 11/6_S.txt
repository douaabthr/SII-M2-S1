crow search algorithm with discret wavelet transform to aid mumford shah inpaint model
inpaint play a sign rol in solv a vary of im process issu that compr zoom remov of impuls nois remov of scratches etc
thes spec sign ar al assocy to inpaint in im domain
ev though mor adv inpaint model hav been introduc it suff from problem of hav low qual
hent thi pap intend to develop a novel inpaint model on the bas of ms model
init the pre-processing of the im is don by discret waveley transform dwt and furth it giv to ms inpaint model
moreov the filt coefficy in dwt algorithm is optim by crow search algorithm csa that is being consid as the main object
as the result im involv mor scratches thi propos model necessit smooth im model us reproduc kernel hilbert smooth rkhs
with al thes techn the propos inpaint model is term as crow search optim dwt kernel-based ms codwtk-ms
dur the perform analys the propos method is comp ov vary tradit inpaint model lik ms dwt-based ms dwt kernel-based ms and dragonf optim dwt kernel-based ms dodwtk-ms in term of sev meas and prov the supery of propos inpaint model .
