optim us lion algorithm a biolog inspir from lion s soc behavy
nature-inspired optim algorithm espec evolv computation-based and swarm intelligence-based algorithm ar being us to solv a vary of optim problem
mot by the oblig of hav optim algorithm a novel optim algorithm bas on a lion s un soc behavy had been pres in our prevy work
territ defens and territ takeov wer the two most popul lion s soc behavy
thi pap tak the algorithm forward on rig and divers perform test to demonst the versatil of the algorithm
four diff test suit ar pres in thi pap
the first two test suit ar benchmark optim problem
the first suit had comparison with publ result of evolv and few renown optim algorithm whil the second suit lead to a comp study with state-of-the-art optim algorithm
the test suit 3 tak the large-scal optim problem wherea test suit 4 consid benchmark engin problem
the perform stat demonst that the lion algorithm is equ to certain optim algorithm whil outperform maj of the optim algorithm
the result also demonst the trade-off maintain of the lion algorithm ov the tradit algorithm .
