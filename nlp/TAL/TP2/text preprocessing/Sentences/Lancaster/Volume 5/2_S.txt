evolv a-type art neur network
we investig tur s not of an a-type art neur network
we study a refin of tur s origin ide mot by work of teusch bul preen and copeland
our a-types can process bin dat by acceiv and output sequ of bin vect hent we can assocy a funct to an a-type and we say the a-typerepresentsthe funct
ther ar two mod of dat process clamp and sequ
we describ an evolv algorithm involv graph-theoretic manip of a-types which search for a-types repres a giv funct
the algorithm us both mut and crossov op
we impl the algorithm and apply it to three benchmark task
we found that the algorithm perform much bet than a random search
for two out of the three task the algorithm with crossov perform bet than a mutation-only vert .
