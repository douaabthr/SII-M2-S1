al tur s unorg machin and art neur network his remark ear work and fut poss
in a techn report submit in 1948 al tur pres a far-sighted survey of the prospect of construct machin cap of intellig behavio
thi report was al the mor remark for hav been writ at a tim when the first program digit comput wer just begin to be built leav tur with on pap and pencil with which to expl his modern comput idea
tur may hav been the first to suggest us random connect network of neuron-like nod to perform comput and propos the construct of larg brain-like network of such neuron cap of being train as on would teach a child
som modern work has been perform on tur s neur network but al of it involv the inv of new structures outsid the scop of tur s origin spec in ord to solv a techn er on tur s part
i propos an altern solv to tur s techn er on which doe not requir the inv of new structures and outlin an approach which may allow the bet expl of the particul property of tur s network in their own right
i also giv exampl of way in which to avoid view tur s ear and strikingly origin work through the len of the conv of modern neur network the
us a genet search to config such network as tur suggest is lik to yield non-intuitive or algorithm opaqu result but thi is lik to be a property of brain-like network themselv and a sign we ar approach tur s init goal .
