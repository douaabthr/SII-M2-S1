in thi pap we investig the fraud detect problem and examin how learn class system can be apply to it
we describ the common property of fraud introduc an abstract problem which can be tun to exhibit thos charact
we report expery on thi abstract problem with a popul real-time learn class system algorithm result from our expery demonst that thi approach can overcom the difficul inh to the fraud detect problem
fin we apply the algorithm to a real-world problem and show that it can achiev good perform in thi domain .
