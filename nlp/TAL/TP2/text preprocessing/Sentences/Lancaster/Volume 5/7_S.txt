produc system rul as protein complex from genet reg network an init study
thi short pap introduc a new way by which to design produc system rul
an indirect encod scheme is pres which view such rul as protein complex produc by the temp behavio of an art genet reg network
thi init study begin by us a simpl bool reg network to produc tradit ternary-encoded rul bef mov to a fuzzy vary to produc real-valued rul
competit perform is shown with rel genet reg network and rule-based system on benchmark problem .
