evolv kernel machin
thi spec issu onevolv kernel machines ded to the latest develop in combin kernel-based algorithm and evolv comput
kernel-based method ar among the state-of-the-art approach in machin learn and dat min e.g. 3,4
the ide of kernel machin is to chang the repres of the input dat by map the input spac to som met feat spac
the kernel is a real-valued funct of two input spac el that correspond to a scal produc of it argu map to the feat spac 1
in algorithm us the kernel trick al op in the feat spac can be express by scal produc and the kernel replac al thes op
what ar the adv of us a kernel
the kernel rend an explicit map of input dat to the feat spac unnecess and a kernel funct can us be comput much mor efficy than map two dat point to the feat spac and comput their scal produc in the feat spac repres
thu a kernel allow to work in very high-dimensional feat spac
furth kernel-based algorithm ar very modul and flex
apart from hyperparamet such as learn rat and regul paramet on the kernel funct has to be chang when the problem domain chang
the kernel defin the feat spac and the algorithm s not of simil between input object
the clear interfac mak handl of non-standard dat e.g. biolog sequ comp easy
fin the conveny mathem structure of the kernel-induced feat and hypothes spac support design and analys of the adapt system .
