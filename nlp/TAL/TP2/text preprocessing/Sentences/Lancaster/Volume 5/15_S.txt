tun and evolv of support vect kernel
kernel-based method lik support vect machin svm hav been est as pow techn in machin learn
the ide of svm is to perform a map from the input spac to a higher-dimensional feat spac us a kernel funct so that a linear learn algorithm can be employ
howev the burd of choos the appropry kernel funct is us left to the us
it can easy be shown that the acc of the learn model high depend on the chos kernel funct and it paramet espec for complex task
in ord to obtain a good class or regress model an appropry kernel funct in combin with optim pre and post-processed dat must be us
to circumv thes obstac we pres two solv for optim kernel funct a autom hyperparamet tun of kernel funct combin with an optim of pre and post-processing opt by sequ paramet optim spo and b evolv new kernel funct by genet program gp
we review modern techn for both approach comp their diff strengths and weak
we apply tun to svm kernel for both regress and class
autom hyperparamet tun of standard kernel and pre and post-processing opt alway yield to system with excel predict acc on the consid problem
espec spo-tuned kernel lead to much bet result than al oth test tun approach
regard gp-based kernel evolv our method rediscov multipl standard kernel but no sign improv ov standard kernel wer obtain .
