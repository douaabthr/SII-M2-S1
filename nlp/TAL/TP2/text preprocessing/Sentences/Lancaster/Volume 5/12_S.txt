on princip compon analys for high-dimensional xcsr
xcsr is an accuracy-based learn class system which can handl class problem with real-value feat
howev as the numb of feat increas a high class acc com at the cost of mor resourc larg pop siz and long comput run tim
in thi pap we investig pca-xcsr a sequ apply of pca and xcsr in three environ with diff charact a discret and imb environ kdd 99 network intrud a continu and high symmet environ miniboon and a high discret high imb environ census/income kdd
thes expery show that in the three diff environ pca-xcsr in addit to being abl to reduc the comput resourc and tim requir of xcsr by approxim 50 is abl to consist maintain it high acc
in addit to that it reduc the requir pop siz nee by xcsr
also we suggest heur for select the numb of princip compon to us when us pca-xcsr .
