xcsf with loc delet prev detry forget
the xcsf class system it solv regress problem with a pop of overlap loc approxim
we show that problem solv stabl and acc may be lost in particul set main due to xcsf s glob delet
we introduc loc delet which prev thes detry effect to larg ext
we show expery that loc delet can prev forget in vary problem particul wher the problem spac is non-uniformly or non-independently sampl
whil we us xcsf with hyper-ellipsoidal receiv field and linear approxim herein loc delet can be apply to any xcs vert wher loc can be simil defin
for fut work we propos to apply xcsf with loc delet to unb non-uniformly distribut loc sampl problem with complex manifold structures within which vary target er valu may be reach select .
