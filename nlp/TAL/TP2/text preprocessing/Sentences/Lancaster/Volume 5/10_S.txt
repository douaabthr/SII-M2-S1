funct approxim with lwpr and xcsf a comp study
funct approxim also cal regress is an import tool in num mathem and engin
the most challeng approxim problem ar when the funct class is unknown and the surfac has to be approxim onlin from incom sampl
on way to achiev good approxim of complex non-linear funct is to clust the input spac into smal patch apply linear model in each nich and recombin thes model via a weight sum
whil it is rath simpl to optim fit a linear model to giv dat it is fair complex to find a reason structuring of the input spac in ord to exploit linear in the und funct
we comp two non-parametric regress algorithm that ar abl to approxim multi-dimensional non-linear funct onlin
the xcsf learn class system is a mod vert of xcs which is agenetics-based machin learn algorithm
loc weight project regress is astatistics-based machin learn techn that is main us for funct approxim task in robot
for both algorithm the relev conflict perform criter areaccuracyandpop siz that is the numb of loc model
we expl the trade-off between thos criter on three benchmark problem by mean of intens grid search for pareto optim solv
detail learn behavy is investig us select pareto optim paramet
the illust of fin input spac clust shed light on the structuring cap
a discuss of adv and drawback complet thi comp study .
