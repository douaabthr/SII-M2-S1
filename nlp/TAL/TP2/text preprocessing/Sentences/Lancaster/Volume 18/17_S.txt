an efficy multilevel thresholding im seg through improv eleph herd optim
thi pap propos an improv vert of rec develop swarm-based metah algorithm eleph herd optim eho cal improv eleph herd optim ieho
in thi ieho the opposition-based learn obl rul and chaos-embedded sequ ar incorp with each it stag of eho to maintain the prop bal between the expl and exploit phas
it reg the mov of the search ag and avoid prem converg
the effect of the propos model is evalu in term of find the optim threshold valu in multilevel thresholding mth of im seg which sep the diff object of the im
the method such as the kap entrop otsu and mas entrop ar us as the object funct in thi problem to determin the optim threshold
the propos ieho s perform is comp with the diff vary of eho art bee colony abc and art hummingbird algorithm ah
the sim result regard converg spee stabl and solv qual perform ind such as the structural simil index ssim feat simil index fsim and peak signal-to-noise ratio psnr ver the viabl of the abov hybrid algorithm .
