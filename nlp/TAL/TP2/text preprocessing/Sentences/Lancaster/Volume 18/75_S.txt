evolv optim for enh self-supervised learn lev genet algorithm for repres learn
contrast learn has ar as a pot method in self-supervised learn ssl seek to acquir rich and sign repres from unlabel dat by differenty between posit and neg sampl
howev the eff of contrast learn is heavy cont upon many aspect includ feat repres hyperparamet and dat aug techn which ar oft man tun and suboptim
to address thes challeng thi research pres a un framework nam hoclg that us genet algorithm gas to autom and optim thes crit compon for contrast learn
in fact by combin ga with contrast learn we provid a system method for optim feat repres improv the qual of learn repres adjust hyperparamet investig dat aug techn and form ssl challeng
thi study examin the us of self-supervised learn to enh the precid of ident dam reg in med im us high-intensity focus ultrasound hifu
the framework is pretrain on large-scal dataset imagenet deeples breast ultrasound and fine-tuned for ultrasound im analys
expery find ind that the propos method may improv repres learn eff and provid subst progress in med pict interpret
spec it achiev the highest acc of 94.3% on the deep les ct im dataset and the highest precid of 96.7% on the breast ultrasound dataset
key innov includ a custom contrast loss funct lev cauchy distribut for simil scor and a ga-driven optim of resnet architect aug policy and hyperparamet . our find highlight hoclg s abl to improv repres qual and diagnost acc in med im particul for scenario with limit label dat
the framework s evolv approach off a scal solv for ssl optim with pot apply beyond healthc
thi work adv the integr of metah and ssl provid a robust tool for autom high-precision med im analys .
