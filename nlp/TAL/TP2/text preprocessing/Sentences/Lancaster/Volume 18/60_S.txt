solv the capacit facil loc problem with serv dist and outsourc us a custom art bee colony algorithm
thi artic consid a vary of the capacit facil loc problem wher each custom has a non-negative demand and each facil has a non-negative capac limit and a serv dist beyond which it cannot serv custom
a fix numb of facil ar op from pot loc
the op facil can on provid serv to the custom incur serv cost
due to the capac limit and serv dist of facil al the custom may not be serv by the op facil and thes custom can be outsourc incur outsourc cost
each custom has it own non-negative outsourc cost
the goal is to minim the sum of serv and outsourc cost
thi problem is term the capacit facil loc problem with serv dist and outsourc cflpsdo
a 0-1 integ linear program form for cflpsdo is pres in thi artic
for expery 45 inst ar gen from real-world maxim cov loc problem inst
thes ar solv us the exact solv cplex to cre benchmark solv
then a custom art bee colony abc algorithm-based metah with two op for enh search spac expl and exploit is employ and found to produc optim solv efficy .
