improv bio-inspired algorithm for scheduling distribut no-waiting flow shop with setup tim
thi pap address the distribut permut flow shop scheduling problem mot by an indust apply rel to the manufact of print circuit board
the goal is to minim tot tardy whil consid constraint such as no-waiting and sequence-dependent setup tim
we hav introduc an exact method bas on mix integ linear program and three bio-inspired meta-heuristics
spec we hav expl the effect of three bio-inspired meta-heuristics the art bee colony abc migr bird optim mbo and genet algorithm ga to tackl the problem at hand
to enh our approach and minim tot tardy we incorp loc search improv techn
in addit to standard meta-heuristic form we integr spec loc search techn includ the path relink pr techn vary neighb search vns and the individ improv scheme ii proc
thi integr led to the develop of three enh meta-heuristics hbox abc _ pr hbox mbo _ vns and hbox ga _ ii
through sim study on vary inst we hav demonst the supery perform of the hbox mbo _ vns algorithm achiev a success rat of 87.18 ov oth hybrid meta-heuristics .
