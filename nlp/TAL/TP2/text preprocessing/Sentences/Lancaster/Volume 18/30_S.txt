hybrid pso-ga optim for enh decid tre perform in soil class and crop cult predict
agricult hold profound sign in the liv and liv of bangladesh s pop
the esc pop has contribut to a reduc in avail ar land exacerb concern about the feas of farm
in vary reg of bangladesh ther is a prevail perceiv that certain area ar unsuit for cult
consequ a subst amount of land stil nee to be tap and expl for agricult purpos contribut to underutil and hind pot agricult develop in thes reg
consid thes issu thi study seek to forecast the optim crop cho for spec soil class en individ to mak mor inform decid about crop cult on their land
init the soil class is ident bas on it un charact within a giv are and subsequ crop select is determin bas on thes distinct soil class
thi study expl the perform of partic swarm optim pso and genet algorithm ga
it propos a hybrid pso-ga techn to optim the decid tre model for forecast crop cult bas on class soil
the perform of a standalon decid tre model is also meas
in soil class the hybrid pso-ga approach demonst supery perform achiev an acc of 96.04% surpass individ pso ga and standalon decid tre method
in crop cult predict the hybrid approach outperform individ pso ga and decid tre method with an acc of 92.63%
the result highlight the eff of the integr pso-ga strategy in optim the dt model for prec agricult predict
thi research contribut valu insight for enh decid support system in agricult provid a prom avenu for improv acc in soil class and crop cult predict .
