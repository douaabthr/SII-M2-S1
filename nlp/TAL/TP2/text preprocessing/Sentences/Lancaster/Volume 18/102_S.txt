a new ant stridulation-based loc search for combin optim problem
stridulating insect lik ant us acoust commun as a cruc part of their soc behavy allow them to coordin their act and respond to chang environ condit
thi pap introduc a novel loc search-based approach inspir by the acoust commun in real ant colony
despit the larg numb of ex bio-inspired metah no singl algorithm is univers optim and a new approach inspir by ant sound commun could off adv in spec problem
sound-bas mech could provid bet way to bal expl and exploit pot improv search efficy
in the propos approach art ant employ a 2 opt loc search guid by acoust sign to enh the qual of a pop of init solv
to assess the eff of the propos approach expery ar conduc on vary benchmark inst of the travel salesm problem
expery result demonst prom perform outperform or match state-of-the-art algorithm on sev benchmark inst .
