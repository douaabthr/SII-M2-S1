comp analys of acc and comput complex across 21 swarm intellig algorithm
nonlinear complex optim problem ar prev in many sci and engin field
tradit algorithm oft struggle with thes problem due to their high dimend and int nat mak them time-consuming
many research hav propos new metah algorithm inspir by biolog behavy in nat which comp show high perform and acc than tradit optim algorithm
nature-inspired algorithm particul thos bas on swarm intellig off adapt and efficy solv to thes challeng
in rec year swarm intellig algorithm hav mad sign adv
class and cec benchmark suit ar immers us for study the perform of optim algorithm
accord to our lit survey we ident that many algorithm wer evalu bas on acc
cur swarm intellig algorithm ar us in many apply and efficy and comput complex nee to be evalu
a broad-level study of the comput complex and acc of popul swarm intellig algorithm has not been don rec
theref thi study we comprehend evalu and comp 21 bio-inspired swarm intellig algorithm on eight non-separable unimod eight sep unimod fiv non-separable multimod sev sep multimod funct and two cec 2018 many object funct
we study the structure and mathem model of the select algorithm
then we categ select algorithm into six diff behavy group
we calc the root mean squ er between expect and act valu
then we perform an rmse cross-validation stat test to understand how acc an algorithm resolv an av problem
we found that art lizard search optim also is the most promin algorithm in acc and efficy
besid that cat swarm optim cso squirrel search algorithm ssa and chimp optim algorithm choa-b ar also consid mor univers algorithm
the squirrel search algorithm ssa is also s second-best algorithm in tim complex
wasp swarm algorithm wso and bat-inspired algorithm ba pres the lowest tim complex
