fast impl of extrem learn machine-based directrank for surrogate-assisted evolv algorithm
surrogate-assisted evolv algorithm saea hav been wid us to solv comput expend optim problem
the extrem learn machine-based directrank eldr is a single-layer feed-forward neur network surrog model design for saea
eldr estim the supery of two solv with a high estim acc ev in high-dimensional problem
howev eldr requir a long comput tim as the problem dimend and the numb of hid neuron increas thu mak it difficult to apply it to high-dimensional problem
a surrog model should be comput efficy and en rapid fit estim
theref thi pap propos a fast impl techn i.e. fast vert eldr feldr that achiev mathem equ learn result with low comput complex
addit thi pap propos a pointw scor funct to rend the predict result reus
the expery result confirm the effect of feldr when comp with the origin eldr
the learn result of the propos feldr wer equ to thos of the origin eldr whil reduc the train tim by up to 97% espec when us a larg hid lay on a high dimend problem
moreov due to the reus predict result the comput tim of the feldr-assisted sae can be furth decreas by 79.5% when comp with that of the origin eldr-assisted sae
the reduc train tim and reus predict result of feldr rend it feas to apply eldr to high-dimensional optim problem and real a high predict acc with a larg numb of hid neuron .
