capac predict model for lithium-ion battery bas on bi-directional lstm neur network optim by adapt converg fact gold rush optim
lithium-ion battery play a cruc rol in our dai liv
acc predict the stat of heal soh and remain us lif of lithium-ion battery is ess
to solv the limit in predict acc of tradit method a new approach is propos that us an adapt converg fact improv gold rush optim gro to optim a bi-directional long short-term mem bilstm neur network for predict lithium-ion battery capac
sint the capac degrad of lithium-ion battery follow tim sery pattern bilstm has been chos to solv thi issu effect
at the sam tim to enh the learn cap of bilstm gro is us to optim the network s weight and bia paramet result in high predict acc
in addit an adapt converg fact is propos to bal gro s loc and glob search cap
comp to oth neur network such as feed-forward neur network fnn long short-term mem lstm neur network and bilstm as wel as diff meta-heuristic optim algorithm to optim bilstm lik diff evolv de har hawk optim hho whal optim algorithm woa and gre trev optim gto the expery result show that the optim model perform bet and predict battery capac with increas acc .
