del a strategy for resolv redund in ent pair within dual ent link for rel tripl extract
cur the mainstream method for rel tripl extract main employ joint model and hav achiev sign result
howev thes method stil fac challeng in deal with the complex of unstruct text
in joint model bas on label rel tripl extract the birt model suff from the issu of redund ent pair lead to the gen of incorrect tripl
to address thi issu thi pap introduc a ground ent extract which is design to aid the dual ent link del in addit advers train method ar introduc dur the del train process
expery result demonst that the del model extract ent pair from two direct when comp to the prevy birt model it gen mor acc ent pair
on the webnlg dataset the acc increas by 2.9% and f1 improv by 1.1%
on the nyt10 dataset acc increas by 1.0% recal increas by 0.5% and f1 scor improv by 0.7%
thi bring sign enh to the tripl ent extract task and in comparison with 8 baselin model across al dataset the del model achiev bet result .
