multi-strategy improv black-winged kit algorithm and it apply in short-term load forecast us gat recur unit neur network
to enh glob search cap and converg efficy of the black kit algorithm bka thi pap propos a multi-strategy improv black kit algorithm swbka
first latin hypercub sampl is introduc to improv the init pop qual
second a fus cauchy-gaussian disturb and adapt spir posit upd strategy is propos to bal the glob search and loc exploit cap dur the migr behavy
fin a len im revers learn elit strategy is incorp to help the algorithm effect avoid loc optim
abl expery on the three strategies wer conduc us 13 benchmark funct and the perform of the improv algorithm was valid on 42 funct
expery result show that the propos swbka achiev an overal av improv of 47.38% in optim valu comp to bka demonst sign supery
furtherm the propos swbka was us to optim the hyperparamet of the gat recur unit neur network follow by predict expery on an act elect load dataset
the expery result demonst the algorithm s cap to solv real-world problem
