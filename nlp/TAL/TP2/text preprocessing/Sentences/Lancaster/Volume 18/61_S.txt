novel hybrid swarm intellig algorithm for solv the capacit vehic rout problem efficy
thi pap introduc a novel glob optim framework igwoa_obl_ms which integr the whal optim algorithm woa and grey wolf optim gwo furth enh through the integr of mut strategies ms and opposition-based learn obl
the igwoa_obl_ms aim to effect bal expl and exploit by util woa s cap for extend glob search alongsid gwo s proficy loc optim
obl expand the search spac whil mut strategies enh solv divers and address stagn
the framework s perform is rig evalu on cec 2022 benchmark funct show supery optim cap comp to ex method
it is furth test on a rang of standard capacit vehic rout problem cvrp benchmark dataset demonst scal and robust across diff problem scal
fin the algorithm is apply to two real-world cem delivery cas study wher it effect optim the dual object of bal cost and tim
thi highlight it pract appl in sustain log and it abl to handl complex multi-objective trade-offs
thes result est the igwoa_obl_ms framework as a sign adv in hybrid meta-heuristics provid robust scal solv for cvrp and complex multidimend optim challeng .
