gauss mixt model and bayes convolv neur network for abnorm musculoskelet radiograph class
musculoskelet radiograph class has been gain gre at due to it import apply in autom diagnos of musculoskelet disord
gen musculoskelet radiograph capt im of vary bon in the whol body which can be consid as a combin of multipl singl dataset
ex work hav tri to build eith a tradit neur network nn convolv neur network cnn or bayes convolv neur network bcnn to achiev efficy class
howev non of them expl the mixed-dataset property
in thi context we propos a novel gauss mixt model-based bcnn mixbcn for the abnorm musculoskelet radiograph class problem
in the propos method the distribut of nn weight is repres as a gauss mixt distribut expect a new neur network model with bet repres
in addit we propos an ensembl learn approach to efficy combin pot nn backbon
perform evalu is examin for the popul mur dataset and show the supery of the propos model with respect to state-of-the-art bcnn method not by 0.86 in f1 scor and 0.72 in coh s kapp met whil ask for neglig complex overhead .
