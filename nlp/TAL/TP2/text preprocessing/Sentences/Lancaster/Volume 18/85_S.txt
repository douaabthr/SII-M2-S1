a multi-objective optim algorithm for optim bailout alloc in large-scal bank system und risk cont
the interbank lend busy connect bank into a network provid a channel for risk cont
to control the spread of thi risk the govern nee to provid tim bailout
the cur bailout algorithm fac sev challeng 1 most research on bailout strategies on consid stat environ aft risk converg 2 the larg numb of bank in real-world bank system result in an enorm decid spac
so to address the first issu thi pap transform the dynam bailout problem into a stat multi-objective optim model and develop a dynam govern bailout framework
to efficy handl high-dimensional decid vary an improv genet algorithm the large-scal non-dominated sort genet algorithm is propos
thi method analys the rel between decid vary and object group rel vary and decompos the larg decid spac into smal subspac
it also introduc two loc search strategies to enh expl and improv solv qual
expery on both benchmark test and real-world cas confirm that the propos method outperform ex algorithm in term of solv qual and comput efficy .
