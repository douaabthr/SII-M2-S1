cov optim in wireless sens network bas on multi-strategy dung beetl optim algorithm
wireless sens network wsn compos of num distribut sens nod is wid us across vary field but fac sev challeng with cov optim being on of the most crit
the siz of the nod cov are direct impact network perform
to address thi issu a multi-strategy dung beetl optim algorithm msdbo is propos to optim cov in two-dimensional and three-dimensional reg
in msdbo to maxim the effect of rol bal beetl the proport of rol bal beetl is dynam chang
optim bound control strategy effect util relev posit inform to ens that the search cap of the algorithm is not affect by bound constraint
addit a random numb is employ to chang the inert fact
fin to enh the cap of the algorithm to escap loc optim the cur solv optim solv and posit of random select ar integr to gen a new solv
subsequ comp with oth algorithm on the cec2017 and cec2022 test set the perform of the algorithm is evalu in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional wsn scenario
the result ind that the maxim av cov of msdbo in 2d and 3d scen can reach 96.97% and 77.7% respect .
