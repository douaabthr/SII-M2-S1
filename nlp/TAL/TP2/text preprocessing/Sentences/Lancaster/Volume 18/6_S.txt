deep reinforc learning-based spatio-temporal graph neur network for solv job shop scheduling problem
the job shop scheduling problem jssp is a well-known np-hard combin optim problem that focus on assign task to limit resourc whil adh to certain constraint
cur deep reinforc learn drl bas solv ar being wid us to solv the jssp by defin the problem structure on disjunct graph
som of the propos approach attempt to lev the structural inform of the jssp to capt the dynam of the environ without consid the tim depend within the jssp
howev learn graph repres on from the structural rel of nod result in a weak and incomplet repres of thes graph which doe not provid an express repres of the dynam in the environ
in thi study unlik ex framework we defin the jssp as a dynam graph to explicit consid the time-varying aspect of the jssp environ
to thi end we propos a novel drl framework that capt both the spat and temp attribut of the jssp to construct rich and complet graph repres
our drl framework introduc a novel at graph isomorph network attentive-gin bas spat block to learn the structural rel and a temp block to capt the tim depend
addit we design a gat fus block that select combin the learn repres from the two block
we train the model us the proxim policy optim algorithm of reinforc learn
expery result show that our train model exhibit sign perform enh comp to heur dispatch rul and learning-based solv for both random gen dataset and publ benchmark .
