enh secret bird optim algorithm for enh dg deploy and reconfig in elect distribut network to improv pow system efficy
optim distribut gen dg plac and network restruct in rad distribut system can sign enh techn accompl and effect in op
thi study introduc a hybrid secret bird optim hsbo algorithm an enh vert of the origin sbo spec design to address the challeng of multi-dimensional and complex optim problem in such system
the hsbo incorp cauchy mut for improv expl and opposition-based learn to ens a divers and repres init pop
the optim techn aim to minim a multi-objective funct that consid act and react pow loss and volt devy
the propos algorithm is test on 85 nod 141 nod and 415 nod system and comp with state-of-the-art optim techn includ the origin sbo gold jack optim and partic swarm optim
assess of perform ar carry out und diff voltage-dependent load model includ const pow const cur const imp and composit load
addit a cost benefit analys assess the econom benefit through quant the reduc in econom loss achiev through appropry dg deploy and network reconfig
result demonst the hsbo s supery perform in integr dg unit with optim pow fact and perform network reconfig
for the 85 nod network act pow loss is reduc by 97.49% react pow loss by 98.14% and volt devy by 98.86%
in the 141 nod system act pow loss is reduc by 95.11% react pow loss by 95.44% and volt devy by 87.02%
in the 415 nod network act pow loss is reduc by 80.92% react pow loss by 79.77% and volt devy by 76% .
