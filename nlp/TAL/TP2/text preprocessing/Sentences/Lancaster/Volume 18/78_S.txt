an apply of a two-level genet search for the soft-clustered vehic rout problem
we propos a two-level hybrid genet search hgs for the soft-clustered vehic rout problem softcluvrp an extend of the capacit vrp wher custom ar group into clust that vehic can ent and exit multipl tim to reduc cost
the method decompos the problem into cluster-level and node-level subproblem each optim via tail loc search
