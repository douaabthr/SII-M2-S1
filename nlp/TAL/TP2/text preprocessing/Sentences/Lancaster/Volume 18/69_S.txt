a linear partit divers met for evalu of permutation-based metah algorithm
metah algorithm implicit or explicit typ aim to achiev a del bal between expl and exploit when improv a pop of solv for a giv optim problem
divers met ar cruc ind for both expl and exploit which serv as a valu tool for assess the perform of metah algorithm
although sev met for divers hav been propos the maj of them ar on suit for problem with continu spac
howev many optim problem ar defined/model bas on discret vary and permut repres is wid us for model real-world problem
many ex met ar not appl to permutation-based problem
apply oth ex met to such problem frequ encount two prim drawback comput cost and effect to repres the act divers of the pop
to address thes drawback a new exclud divers met is propos in thi work for optim problem model by permut
thi method calc divers by linear and partit the problem spac bas on the pop distribut in the spac and count the numb of individ in the partit
comp to the elev avail met includ both permutation-based and us non-permutation-based met in the lit the propos method demonst supery perform exhibit acceiv acc stabl sensit and robust particul in the pres of out and requir minim comput cost
the acc of the result of the method is on av 35% bet than baselin met
the comput cost of the method is also near 50% bet than the fastest avail method
thes charact mak the met a valu mean for analys ex algorithm behavy or design new on .
