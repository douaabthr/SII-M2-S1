gold jack optim algorithm with a pop qual improv framework for real-world engin optim problem
in thi study a pop qual improv pqi framework to enh the perform of the rec emerg nature-inspired metah algorithm nam gold jack optim gjo algorithm for solv real-world engin optim problem is propos
first the maximin lhs strategy is employ to gen the init pop which can efficy enh the search spac in the ear stag
then a non-linear pop reduc mech is apply to screen out the individ with unsatisfy solv and it can also reduc the comput complex
meanwhil a novel circul mut strategy is introduc which can dynam adjust the algorithm to expl in a wild spac or to exploit deep thi method can not on accel the converg of the optim but also reduc the risk of trap in the loc optim
moreov the propos framework show tremend pot in apply to oth population-based search algorithm due to that the algorithm ar improv whil remain the inh mathem structure and search strategy
the expery result demonst that the propos framework can efficy improv the perform of gjo on solv real-world engin optim problem and the propos pqi gjo algorithm can sav 196.7001 h 0.3595 mw and 0.0552 p. u
in comparison with the state-of-art algorithm jay in solv opf problem for ieee-57 bus system .
