an enh spars subset select model bas on adapt project dist
subset select focus on ident repres sampl from a larg dataset to produc a dat subset that can repres the main feat of the origin dat and also reduc the dat siz in an effect way
spars repres the put emphas on enh the dat spars whil subset select aim to reduc the dat siz
spars subset select is an import branch of subset select that incorp spars repres the into the expl of subset select
