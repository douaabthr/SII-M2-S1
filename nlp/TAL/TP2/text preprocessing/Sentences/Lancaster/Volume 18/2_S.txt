evolv algorithm framework for optim truck scheduling in multi-dock truck cross-docking cent
cross-docking optim log by reduc stor and handl tim in wareh wher cargo ar unload from inbound truck and load direct onto outbound vehic
thi pap address the crit challeng of minim makesp in a multi-dock parallel machin set within cross-docking cent
we propos a novel framework that integr an evolv algorithm ea with a machin learn ml bas hyperparamet tun mech to optim truck sequ
thi study fil the research gap by off a quant improv ov tradit heur method del up to a 37% improv in the gap met comp to state-of-the-art techn
it also achiev a 30% enh ov the pch construct heur us for gen init solv
addit our ml-based tun strategy provid up to a 21% perform increas ov stat tun method
not thes improv ar attain whil maintain a competit comput tim as report in the lit .
