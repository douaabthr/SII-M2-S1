emerg deep learn approach for urb satellit im analys a survey on class seg and chang detect
the study of urb satellit imagery has undergon a sign transform due to the emerg of deep learn techn
thi survey thorough examin cur progress in deep learn model design for three prim task class seg and chang detect in urb environ
a tot of 114 review study wer analys includ convolv neur network cnns hybrid model and transformer-based model such as resnet unet hrnet br-net mask2former transcfccn and stcd-effv2t unet
promin dataset such as euros uc-merced spacenet deepglob levir-cd and xbd wer examin alongsid perform met lik acc f1 scor iou precid and recal with result vis through comp bar plot
our comparison analys ind that model such as googlenet efficientnet-b7 and maxvit achiev class acc ov 99% whil seg model lik mask2former and br-net exhibit iou scor ov 92%
stcd-effv2t unet achiev exceiv f1 scor of up to 98.79% for chang detect
thes model ar cruc for urb develop and environ chang monit facilit the class of land cov typ seg of build road and urb feat as wel as the detect of urb and environ chang
thi study defin grow trend and challeng incorp model gen dataset divers and comput complex
it addit suggest fut direct includ the us of mamb network for scal temp model the incorp of vis transform for enh feat extract and the util of gan for dataset aug
thi pap off a comprehend and system synthes of deep learn methodolog est a funda ref for subsequ research in urb satellit im analys .
