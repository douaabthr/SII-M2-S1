smadasyn-boosted cross-project transf learn for effect sec fault predict
purpos security-related softw fault predict is ess yet challeng due to limit label vuln dat and the inconsist of fault pattern across softw project
thi study aim to improv the gen of fault predict model us a cross-project learn approach
method we propos a cross-project transf learn framework for sec fault predict enh by feat distribut align techn includ kolmogorov smirnov ks test anderson darl test and pearson correl
to effect address the issu of class imb prev in vuln dataset we introduc smadasyn a hybrid oversampl method that integr the strengths of smot synthet min oversampl techn and adasyn adapt synthet sampl
the propos approach is empir valid across six apach softw project us a rang of class decid tre naiv bay log regress and random forest along with ensembl method such as bag boost and stack
result expery result demonst that random forest consist achiev the highest perform particul in term of f1-score and recal
stat valid us the friedm test and nemeny post-hoc analys confirm the sign and robust of the result across dataset
conclud the propos method effect enh sec fault predict in cross-project scenario
by combin feat align and adv sampl techn the framework del acc and gen predict off pract valu for softw sec ass .
