bird of prey-based optim bpbo a metah algorithm for optim
optim is a crit challeng across sev engin and sci disciplin
thi pap introduc a un bird of prey-based optim bpbo algorithm which was influ by the astut hunt techn of pred bird
the approach util both individ and group hunt techn whil select target weak bird to effect bal expl and exploit strategies
by incorp a dynam reloc strategy to access mor suit prey thi method enh pop divers and mitig the risk of prem converg
the integr of thes strategies in light of the ongo dynam shift en the bpbo algorithm to effect address a wid rang of problem
thi includ success apply to both small-scale problem with spec constraint and large-scal problem with dimend extend up to 1000
to thorough assess bpbo s effect we conduc an in-depth analys us 23 optim benchmark of which 13 ar design as scal
the cec-2014 benchmark funct ar consid a mor complex test set
furtherm bpbo algorithm is util in pract engin design challeng such as optim weld beam three-bar truss gear train cantilev beam and spee reduc
comp analys wer conduc util nin and eight algorithm across two set of standard test funct
the comparison of the result across al cas util robust algorithm substanty the propos algorithm s effect perform in expl the feas spac of the problem
thorough analys hav been conduc to enh the understand of the behavy exhibit by the algorithm paramet
