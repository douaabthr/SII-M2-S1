a lightweight mech fault diagnos network driv by coop neuroevolv algorithm
large-scal mech fault detect play a crit rol in indust produc and neur network hav been wid adopt for thi task
howev the perform of neur network heavy depend on the optim of their architect and paramet
tradit optim method such as grady desc and partic swarm optim can improv model perform to som ext but they typ requir adjust al weight which not on increas comput complex but also oft lead to redund network structures
to address thes challeng thi pap propos a coop neuroevolv algorithm for construct lightweight neur network tail for fault diagnos task
the algorithm introduc two co-evolving populations-one ded to learn the crit weight of the neur network and the oth focus on optim the prec weight valu
thi approach en the discovery of a spars connect lightweight neur network
by decoupl and coop optim network structure and weight the algorithm can mor efficy expl the search spac to ident model that ar both compact and high-performing
to valid the effect of the propos algorithm extend expery ar conduc on multipl indust dataset involv large-scal mech fault detect
the result demonst that the algorithm maintain high diagnost acc whil sign reduc the numb of model paramet
comp to conv evolv algorithm it exhibit supery model compress cap and gen perform .
