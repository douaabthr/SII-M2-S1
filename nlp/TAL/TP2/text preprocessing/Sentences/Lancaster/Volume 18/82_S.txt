a population-based vary of the singl candid optim for glob optim and multi-level thresholding problem in med im seg
the skin our body s prim def is suscept to num heal issu
ear detect and acc diagnos of such condit rely heavy on med im process
multi-level thresholding im seg is a lead techn in thi field requir an efficy optim to achiev optim result
the singl candid optim sco a metah algorithm has shown prom in optim but is limit by it rely on a singl solv lead to restrict divers and difficul escap loc optim
to overcom thes challeng we introduc a population-based vert of sco term psco
thi approach enh sco by integr an influ strategy to guid the pop s swarm behavio and the invers incomplet gamm funct to deep the intens phas
in addit a soft strategy is develop to bal divers and intens ens a smoo transit from glob to loc search
psco was rig test on the cec 2022 benchmark suit across 10 and 20 dimend consist outperform sco
furtherm the effect of psco is valid in the context of multi-level thresholding im seg apply to two dataset bsd500 for benchmark and is for med im
the algorithm s perform is evalu us otsu s and kap s fit funct across diff thresholds
addit it effect is rig assess by comp it against ten state-of-the-art solv focus on key met such as otsu s and kap s object valu psnr ssim fsim qilv hpsi uiq and cpu tim
the result demonst sign improv highlight psco s pot in gen optim task and spec apply such as med im seg .
