an intellect model of pest detect and class us enh optimization-assisted singl shot detect and graph at network
ident pest in the plant is consid to be an efficy acc and sustain way to improv the food qual and econom valu in the agricult industry
it equip farm with cutting-edge instru to safeguard their harvest less their effect on the environ and satisfy the grow nee for sust on a worldwid scal
deep learn can complet transform the id of pest as it develop protect agricult s produc and resist against ever-changing insect threats
it can be difficult to combin multipl method for pest id includ art intellig satellit im and detect
it is difficult to mak sur that such innov ar avail to farm and funct wel togeth
it s common for farm as wel as oth agricult personnel to requir cert to prop util pest detect equip and understand the find
for thes innov to be wid adopt the gap in understand must be clos
address thes challeng requir an effect novel deep learning-based pest detect method
in thi pap a deep learning-based pest detect and class model is develop to ident diseas caus by pest at an ear stag
init the im ar collect from onlin dataset
collect im underw detect us the adapt singl shot detect assd
to enh the acc and efficy of assd the model paramet ar fine-tuned by util the enh run city gam optim
thi optim process aim to improv the precid of pest detect
the class of pest is don us the propos multi-scale and dil graph at network
thi innov network architect is design to categ the pest effect
the outcom of the propos model is just by comp it with oth class and algorithm .
