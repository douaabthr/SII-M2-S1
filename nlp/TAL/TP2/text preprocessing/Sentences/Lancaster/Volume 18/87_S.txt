hgas an improv hybrid self-adaptive metah approach for dat clust
clust dat into coh group is a machin learn unsuperv techn that aim to partit the dat object into clust with maxim inter-clust dist and minim intra-cluster dist
genet algorithm is a popul metah algorithm with sev shortcom such as loc optim trap prem converg and genet drift problem
consequ to maintain a bal between intens and divers and to resolv the abov issu a new memet algorithm is propos in thi pap
the propos approach hgas is a hybrid of genet and sim an algorithm that expl the neighb search strategy of the sim an algorithm by incorp it as a loc search techn aft the mut phas of the genet algorithm
to overwhelm the genet drift problem the propos algorithm s mut rat is also adjust us a self-adaptive fact that rely on the metah search principl
the propos techn is valid by comp it perform with a genet algorithm us standard benchmark funct
afterward the propos hgas is sim on nin real-life and synthet clust dat set
the efficy of the propos hybrid approach is prov by comp it with well-known standard metah and rec publ hybrid algorithm us the sum of intra-cluster dist and converg spee as object funct
the effect of the propos algorithm is also test as an autom clust algorithm
comput find rev that the hgas clust techn perform bet than oth metah algorithm
sim result demonst the abl of the propos hgas to produc compact and well-separated clust
addit the friedm stat test and two pair t-tests ar perform to ver the suggest hgas method s ex and find approv the surv of the hgas algorithm in the clust are .
