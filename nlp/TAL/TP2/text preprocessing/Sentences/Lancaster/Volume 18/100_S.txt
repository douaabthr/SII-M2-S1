fault detect in photovolta mod us i v curv and machin learn
consid grow glob demand for elect it is ess to invest in cle and renew energy produc
invest in renew energy produc is cruc to cre a sustain matrix that can efficy meet consum nee
reduc cost for sol energy op and maint o m is crit to ens the econom viabl of photovolta pv project
efficy man of thes cost can mak the diff between a success project and an unprofit instal
thi work propos the structuring of a dataset us real meas of cur volt i v curv from a sol plant
bas on thi two class wer perform to detect shad and soil in pv mod
two diff method wer us for feat process
on dataset was cre us complet i v curv whil the oth rely sol on key paramet from a charact curv
the dataset us incorp dat on cur volt irrady and mod temp at the tim of meas
diff machin learn model wer comp achiev 100% acc in soil class and 93.2% in shad class .
