group decid mak approach bas on lingu q-rung orthopair fuzzy yag pow weight geomet aggreg op for select of nanopartic in drug delivery system
lung cant remain on of the most prev and dead form of cant worldwid with a high mort rat and limit tre opt avail
tradit chemotherapy and rady therapy hav been the mainstay of lung cant tre but their eff is oft limit by system tox and drug resist
rec many nanopartic hav been ident and cre for drug delivery with the abl to spec target tum cel whil spar healthy cel or org
the nanoparticle-based drug delivery system off distinct benefit ov conv med delivery includ increas perm and ret effect precid target and improv stabl and biocompat
theref thi pap propos the group decid mak approach und lingu q-rung orthopair fuzzy environ to select the best nanopartic in drug delivery system for lung cant tre
first thi pap propos lingu q-rung orthopair fuzzy yag pow weight geomet aggreg op for aggreg the lingu q-rung orthopair fuzzy numb bas on the yag s norm
thi pap also demonst sev feat of the propos op
moreov by us the propos op thi pap pres the group decid mak approach
furtherm a cas study is pres for the select of optim nanopartic in drug delivery for the tre of lung cant to demonst the propos decid mak approach s appl
fin thi pap pres comparison study sensit analys and supery of propos decid mak approach with the oth ex decid mak method to valid the propos decid mak approach .
