mod random-oppositional chaot art rabbit optim algorithm for solv structural problem and optim siz of hybrid renew energy system
the art rabbit optim aro algorithm reply the surv skil of rabbit in the wild
howev lik oth metah approach it possess sign drawback in solv challeng problem includ slug converg rat poor expl abl and trap in loc optim reg
to allevy thes shortcom a novel strategy nam mod random opposit mro and ten chaot map ar integr with aro term as mrocaro
thi impl mro techn boost the pop divers and permit the pop to escap from loc optim whil integr of chaot map enh the exploit cap
to estim the effect of the mrocaro method the well-known cec2005 cec2017 cec2019 and cec2008lsgo test funct ar consid
moreov non-parametric test that includ the wilcoxon rank-sum and friedm rank test ar perform to analys the sign diff among the comp algorithm
furtherm the efficy of the mrocaro algorithm has been evalu on vary structural problem and optim siz of renew energy system
the expery find demonst that mrocaro perform optim solv with 100% renew sourc with the lowest level cost of elect of 0.0934 kwh as comp to oth method
also the sim find rev that mrocaro has immens pot for address glob optim and structural problem as contrast to oth compet algorithm .
