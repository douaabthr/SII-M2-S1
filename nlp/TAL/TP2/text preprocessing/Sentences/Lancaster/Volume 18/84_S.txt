flos flowerwork-based stack ensembl framework for class of chronic diseas
thi study pres a novel approach for detect and class chronic diseas cds focus on prev condit such as asthm cant and chronic obstruct pulmon diseas copd
ear id of thes diseas is challeng due to overlap symptom limit clin expert and vary in dev sensit
to address thi thi study propos flos a multi-optimization-based stack ensembl model integr the firework and flow pollin algorithm
it op in three stag feat select optim model gen and stack ensembl model cre aim to detect cds and distinct symptom simil condit lik copd and asthm
the model s effect was evalu us two dataset exas and breast cant
the stack ensembl framework consist of four bas class random forest support vect machin multilay perceptron mlp and ext et with their predict aggreg by the meta-learner extrem learn machin
expery result show that flos outperform individ bas class achiev 96.25% acc 96.24% precid 96.25% recal and a 96% f1-score for exas and 95.6% acc 95% precid 95.1% recal and a 96% f1-score for breast cant
thes find highlight flos as a prom approach for acc chronic diseas detect and class .
