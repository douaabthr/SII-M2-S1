evolv multitask algorithm bas on a dynam solv encod strategy for the minim s-club cov problem
the problem of find a coher subgraph not thes-club model which is a subgraph with diamet at most is a wid apply top in soc network analys and group of object model
in particul the minim s-club cov problem min s-club cov is a rec introduc vary in the lit which ask to cov the vert of a graph with a minim numb ofs-club
the ex of common connect among thes high connect compon enco the apply of multitask optim to lev the shar mean knowledg in the discovery of multiples-club at the sam tim
theref thi study propos a multitask evolv algorithm to solv the minimums-club cov problem
our propos is design with an effect solv repres method and evolv op for the vary in the numb of club
each solv is repres by two compon wher the gen numb of a compon can be diff for each individ and can chang dur perform evolv op
we also propos a solv gen method bas on a random greedy algorithm that help to ens individ qual and pop divers in the init pop
the propos algorithm is evalu on two dataset in the dimac libr
thi study then analys the influ of diff fact of the input dat on the propos algorithm result
bas on stat analys of the perform result it is clear that our propos s solv is supery to an ex algorithm on two-thirds of the expery dat set .
