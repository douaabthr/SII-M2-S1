intellig paramet adapt in fuzzy neur network
thi pap address the offlin handwrit sign recognit task a challeng class problem due to high intra-class vary and inter-class simil
the object is to acc class sign im into their correspond id class despit inh uncertainty and imprecid in sign dat
to address thi a convolv neur network is employ for feat extract gen a robust repres of each signature-a discrimin and noise-tolerant feat vect that capt ess structural el of the sign
thes feat ar then class us a fuzzy min-max neur network which excel in handl overlap and ambigu pattern
howev fuzzy min-max neur network s perform is high sensit to it paramet vigil threshold and sensit oft requir time-consuming man tun
to overcom thi limit an evolv strategy is propos for autom paramet optim
thi method us an adapt fit funct and a dynam mut strategy to efficy expl the paramet spac and accel converg
the approach is valid on a propriet offlin sign dataset and the result demonst that the propos evolv strategy-fuzzy min-max neur network system achiev supery acc precid and robust comp to baselin and state-of-the-art method .
