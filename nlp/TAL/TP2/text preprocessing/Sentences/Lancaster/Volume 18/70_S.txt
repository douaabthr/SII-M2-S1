a key-point-based hybrid predict dynam multi-objective evolv algorithm
dynam multi-objective optim problem dmop ar common in real-world scenario yet efficy solv them whil preserv pop divers and achiev converg remain a formid challeng
ex dynam multi-objective evolv algorithm oft fac difficul in adapt respond to vary environ chang frequ lead to comprom trade-offs between divers preserv and converg efficy dur dynam track
thi study introduc a key-point-based hybrid predict dynam multi-objective evolv algorithm moea-dapd aim at ens rapid converg and optim divers in dynam set
the propos algorithm is employ a dual key-point predict mech tail to the frequ of environ chang a centroid-bas predict method is util for infrequ chang to improv stabl whil a clustering-based predict approach is apply for frequ chang to enh converg
to furth address pop divers and optim a dual arch strategy is develop
on arch retain high-quality par solv to facilit loc converg whil the oth preserv divers solv to comprehend repres the glob pareto optim front
addit distinct mut op ar apply sep to the main and arch pop thereby strengthening divers and overal perform in dynam condit
expery evalu benchmark moea-dapd against fiv lead dynam multi-objective evolv algorithm dmoea across three standard test suit
the result highlight that moea-dapd demonst not competit and efficy in tackl dmop .
