synerg optim of predict model for wat qual analys in tre plant us machin learn and evolv algorithm
enh the assess of wat qual is ess for sustain wat man giv it crit impact on environ heal and hum well-being
acc assess pres sev difficul due to the complex and vary of wat ecosystem
among the vary machin learn techn employ support vect regress and adapt boost hav emerg as two of the most wid us and effect method
in rec year many evolv algorithm hav been develop to find approxim solv to optim problem
in thi study we investig how efficy new algorithm consist of hybrid of machin learn method and evolv algorithm can be for som problem
we extend investig support vect regress with vary kernel includ linear rad bas funct polynom and sigmoid
in addit we introduc mod support vect regress and mod adaboost wher standalon ml model ar combin with the swarm-based algorithm such as partic swarm optim limited-memory broyd fletch goldfarb shanno and distribut evolv algorithm in python
we apply the propos hybrid algorithm to the problem of meas wat qual
acc model and assess of riv wat qual ar ess endeav with multifacet challeng
we foc on the tigr riv model in baghdad govern particul at three wat tre plant eastern tigr al-karkh and al-wathba
the dataset compr multipl wat qual paramet with a tot dissolv solid target
incorp swarm-based algorithm into the adopt model has synerg enh their predict cap result in a sign aug of the overal predict prowess of the ml model
the propos hybrid algorithm success enh svr model perform with the l-bfgs-b algorithm yield mean squ er reduc of 46.23% and 28.09% on the east tigr and karkh plant respect
in comparison the msvr-pso approach reduc the wathb plant by up to 85.96%
thes find hav a sign impact on adv wat tre plant
a thorough understand of thes vary is requir when decid on the optim machin learn model for individ apply and gen for tigr riv wat qual scal evalu and beyond .
