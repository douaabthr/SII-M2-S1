multipl glob peak big bang-big crunch algorithm for multimod optim
the main challeng of multimod optim problem is ident multipl peak with high acc in multidimend search spac with irregul landscap
thi work propos the multipl glob peak big bang-big crunch mgp-bbbc algorithm which address the challeng of multimod optim problem by introduc a spec mech for each op
the algorithm expand the big bang-big crunch algorithm a state-of-the-art metah inspir by the univers s evolv
spec mgp-bbbc group the best individ of the pop into cluster-based cent of mass and then expand them with a progress low disturb to guar converg
dur thi process it i apply a distance-based filt to remov unnecess elit such that the on on smal peak ar not lost ii promot isol individ bas on their nich count aft clust and ii bal expl and exploit dur offspr gen to target spec acc level
expery result on twenty multimod benchmark test funct show that mgp-bbbc gen perform bet or competit with respect to oth state-of-the-art multimod optim .
