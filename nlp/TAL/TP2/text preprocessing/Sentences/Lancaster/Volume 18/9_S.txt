toward load frequ man in therm pow system us an improv open-source develop model algorithm
maintain a bal between gen and consum pow is cruc for the efficy op of interconnect pow grid
thi pap focus on the issu of load frequ man in therm pow system
we pres a metah approach to address thi problem lev the adv of metah algorithm in solv complex optim problem
our approach is bas on an improv open-source develop model algorithm odm
the propos method refer to as odma-g integr odm with a genet algorithm ga to config a hybrid optim techn
thi combin allow for the effect exploit and expl of the search spac lead to high-quality solv
we evalu the perform of odma-g us sev benchmark funct with vary scenario
the result demonst that odma-g outperform it peer metah algorithm showcas supery optim cap
thi prom perform suggest that odma-g off an effect solv for the challeng task of load frequ man in therm pow system ens stabl and efficy op
spec the find show that our method improv the frequ chang are and tie-lin pow chang by 2.3% comp to the best ex method .
