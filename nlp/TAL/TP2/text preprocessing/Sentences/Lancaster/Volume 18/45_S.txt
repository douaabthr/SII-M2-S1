hybrid multi-objective partic swarm optim feat select approach with firef algorithm us decid tre class
in machin learn the import of relev dat increas expon
in our propos approach we introduc an optim method that combin partic swarm optim pso and the firef algorithm fa to enh feat select us decid tree-based class
pso is well-suited for smal search spac whil the firef algorithm is effect for larg search spac
the propos method psofa-dt aim to improv class perform by reduc dimend and optim feat select
pso s glob search cap ar compl by fa s loc search and the algorithm s effect is evalu us decid tre acc and hold-out cross-validation
expery result demonst that psofa-dt outperform individ impl of pso and fa in feat reduc and class acc
decid tre acc is us as the prim fit met whil the firef algorithm refin the feat select process
the algorithm bal expl and exploit by adjust key paramet such as inert weight learn fact and attract coefficy
the firef algorithm furth optim feat select enh decid tre perform .
