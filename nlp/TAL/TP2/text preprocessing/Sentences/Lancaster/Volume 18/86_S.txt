a novel fuzzy-entrop bas onlin fuzzy c-means clust algorithm for mass dat
due to the inadequ of standard clust approach for handl extend dat consid research has rec focus on clust larg and extrem larg dataset
spec certain vary of the fam fuzzy c-means algorithm hav been put for test techn for seg dataset and aggreg the intermedy clust result
among them the fuzzy c-means onlin techn is on of the most us for clust larg amount of dat
it splits the dataset into equal-sized subset or chunk and assign a weight to each chunk depend on the memb degr per clust
thi study introduc a novel vary of the onlin fuzzy c-means ofcm algorithm design to boost it perform
our propos method integr a clust compact meas into the weight attribut process quant by the fuzzy entrop of each clust
comp expery conduc across divers class dataset of vary scal demonst that the propos algorithm sign improv the acc of clust result when comp to the standard ofcm
cruc thi enh is achiev without increas the comput complex of the algorithm
furtherm our approach yield perform comp to that of heur fuzzy c-means algorithm whil off the distinct adv of short execut tim
fut research wil foc on expl feat select and reduc techn to adapt the propos algorithm for effect apply to mass dataset charact by an exceiv high numb of feat .
