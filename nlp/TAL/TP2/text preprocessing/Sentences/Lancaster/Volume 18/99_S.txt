skew med data-oriented parallel modul diagnos via scal belief-ruled hierarchy
diagnos gast diseas must address skew med dat wher posit cas of any spec gast diseas constitut on a smal proport of al cas due to the vary of gast diseas
theref a new approach is cal for to effect diagnos multipl gast diseas with high scal
in thi study a skew med data-oriented parallel modul diagnos approach is propos for gast diseas via scal belief-ruled hierarchy
first analys lower-to-middle fact integr funct ar construct
then a middle-to-top diagnos model is construct us a belief-ruled hierarchy
third a skew data-oriented optim model is construct follow by an optim algorithm
fin a parallel modul diagnos mech is propos for multipl gast diseas
a pract cas with 172 cas and nin typ of gast diseas gath from a terty hospit in hangzhou chin dur a three-month period is study for valid
cas study result demonst that the propos approach diagnos posit cas of nin gast diseas with an av acc of 86.93%
comp with fiv oth condit with vary paramet config and four machin learn approach the propos approach produc optim result e.g. 53.61% 15.28% 42.73% and 40.30% by bpnn svm rf and gpr respect ow to it penal coefficy custom to the skew gast dat to bal all-case diagnos acc and positive-cas acc .
