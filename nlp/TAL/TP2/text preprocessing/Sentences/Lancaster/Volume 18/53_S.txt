a collab us of two metah method us q-learning for the travel salesm problem in diff field an apply to smart hom delivery system
thi study propos a metah nam abc-ga-ql for the travel salesm problem tsp wher the q-learning approach is us to select suit metah method in diff it at run tim from two diff typ metah methods-artificial bee colony abc and genet algorithm ga
the algorithm involv two phas
the first phas expl the search spac us abc and ga independ to search the promin zon of the optim path
the perform of ga and abc on a target problem ar not at each it us a reward tabl rt and a q-table qt
the second phas us the method with bet perform in each it to mod the pop
the entry of rt and qt ar upd accord
in thi way abc-ga-ql enh the qual of the search process
the bas perturb rul of abc is mod for the tsps us swap op and the exploit of the method is upd us 3 opt op
ga is also mod us multi-point cyc crossov and 3 opt op to deal with the tsps
abc-ga-ql is test against a set of asymmet and symmet tsps from tsplib with sign larg siz
the method find optim path for the inst hav siz up to 280 nod in most of the run of the algorithm
it perform is comp with som rec publ state-of-the-art algorithm for the tsps us the friedm test and the supery of abc-ga-ql is wel est
the best result obtain in 10 independ run of the method for diff test inst ar list for deep stat comparison in fut study
som approach ar also propos to solv the tsps with cost mat involv fuzzy dat
the algorithm is also us to impl a real-life smart hom delivery system for the onlin busy .
