adapt ant colony optim for solv dynam vehic and dron rout with tim window constraint
thi pap propos a novel extend to the tradit vehic rout problem by introduc the dynam vehic rout problem with dron consid tim window
thi new problem incorp dynam request handl and the innov us of dron to address delivery challeng within spec tim constraint
to tackl dynam vehic rout problem with dron consid tim window we develop an adapt ant colony optim algorithm
in which init rout ar construct to handl known request est a baselin solv
the algorithm adapt to real-time request in the dynam phas by transfer pheromon valu between tim step to find the best solv at each it
thi mech effect exploit past solv and expl high-quality rout for new request with strict tim window
our propos algorithm is valid through extend expery scenario that sim vary spat distribut and time-sensitiv demand
result show that our method produc high-quality solv comp to ex heur and nature-inspired method particul in complex environ with random request and tight tim constraint .
