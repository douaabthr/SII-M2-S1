reliability-based multi-objective optim of truss with greyl goos algorithm
thi pap introduc a multi-objective vary of the greyl goos optim moggo to tackl complex structural optim problem
inspir by the coop behavy of gees in flight moggo employ dynam group to enh problem-solving efficy
six truss structures undergo simult topolog shap and siz optim us moggo aim to maxim rely whil minim structural mass
by incorp non-dominance sort and arch techn moggo extend the single-objectiv greyl goos optim to effect address trade-offs between compet object
evalu met and stat test demonst moggo s supery perform in handl larg structural optim problem preserv mor pareto-optimal set and achiev gre converg and vary in object and decid spac
moggo s abl to man conflict object is furth valid through divers analys with swarm plot illust it supery converg behavy across it
overal moggo prov to be an efficy and effect approach for address challeng reliability-based multi-objective structural optim problem .
