glob optim through promethee-driven tri-point select bas genet algorithm
to address the limit of conv select techn lik roulet wheel select and stochast univers sampl sus thi study introduc the tri-point select tps op an innov enh for genet algorithm gas
us cec 2017 benchmark funct across diff dimend
the propos select scheme tps achiev optim mean valu 35% outperform rw 15% ts 24% and sus 25%
whil the av standard devy of tps 39% is high comp to rw 26% sus 20% and ts 15% tps demonst supery consist by achiev the least standard devy in 33 out of 84 cas
thi bal between expl and stabl en tps to del a high perc of id result show it robust across divers optim scenario
prometh analys furth confirm tps s effect in maintain an optim bal between expl and exploit lead to improv converg perform
thi adv not on refin ga select process but also op new avenu for tps s apply in solv complex optim challeng .
