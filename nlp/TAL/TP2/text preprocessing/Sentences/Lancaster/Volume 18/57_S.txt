research on the risk assess of the green construct of hydra tunnel bas a on combin weighting-cloud model
bas on the complex and sign green construct charact of modern hydra tunnel engin and the ident risk thereof an index was weight us a combin weight method improv analys hierarchy process and entrop weight method
a cloud model for the green construct risk evalu of a hydra tunnel was construct bas on cloud the
aft apply thi model to typ engin situ the digit feat of the cloud model and an evalu cloud map of each index wer obtain
the investig show that in the green construct risk of hydra tunnel the degr of green construct man risk was the highest risk uncertainty of environ pollut and dam risk was the largest and construct resourc util risk was the most unst
the comprehend cloud map rev that the green construct risk of hydra tunnel lay between grad i and ii smal and min risk respect being clos to grad ii
consid the evalu result techn wer ident to improv green construct plan and strengthen green construct man train to reduc project green construct risk .
