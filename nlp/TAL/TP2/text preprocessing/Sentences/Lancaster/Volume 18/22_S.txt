machin learn with indust robot expl the impact of joint angl on cartes coordin us explain ai
thi study us explain art intellig techn to rev the complex rel between joint angl and cartes coordin in the context of indust robot arm
by us machin learn and explain art intellig algorithm it is aim to distinct the domin effect of individ joint angl on the x y and z coordin of the robot end effect
vary machin learn algorithm hav been apply on the dat set and perform output hav been obtain
accord to thes perform result it has been observ that the randomforest algorithm is mor suit for our study than oth model with it low mean squ er and high r-square scor
along with the select machin learn algorithm the dat set was tri to be explain by pass it through shapley addit expl shap describ machin learn expl dalex and explain lik i m 5 eli5 model which ar explain art intellig model
it has been observ that the shap model explain the effect of joint angl on cartes coordin mor consist than oth model with an av sensit of 0.0125 valu rang . our find shed light on the explain aspect of ai model and provid valu inform about the funda mech govern the complex mov of indust robot arm .
