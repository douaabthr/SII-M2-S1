selfvarbl a stacking-based ensembl learn framework with vary numb of base-learners
stack is on of the most popul ensembl learn techn that combin the predict of multipl base-learners bls us a meta-learner to improv the overal perform of the model
to build a stacking-based ensembl most of the ex work select top-k-performing model as the base-learners without consid the comput resourc requir of the system
thi work pres a stacking-based ensembl learn framework with a vary numb of base-learners selfvarbl which is cap of find the trade-off between comput resourc requir and system perform by autom select a suit numb and combin of base-learners
addit the propos framework doe not requir excess comput resourc to achiev the optim solv
the propos framework is valid us three cas study with divers dataset the agricult domain the audio dat analys domain and the self-generated synthet dataset
the expery result show the effect of the propos framework .
