an opposit learn and chaot loc search-based art elect field algorithm for engin optim
metah algorithm ar stochast optim techn inspir by nat phenomen with their perform driv by two key op expl and exploit
despit their success a common limit is their suscept to prem converg and slow progress toward optim solv
to address thes challeng thi study pres an innov extend of the art elect field algorithm aef a method root in charg system search principl
the propos algorithm incorp oppositional-based learn obl and an elit chaot loc search mech to enh both glob and loc search cap
obl improv the expl of the glob search spac whil the elit chaot loc search focus on refin solv around near-optimal reg ens accel converg
thi hybrid approach is test on cec2020 bound-constrain num optim problem and real-world apply such as topolog optim and gear train design
the find demonst the supery of the propos algorithm in term of achiev bet optim solv fast converg rat and reduc algorithm complex when comp to ex state-of-the-art algorithm
som not perform of the propos algorithm ar it demonst supery perform ov al list algorithm for 10d problem f_1 f_2 f_3 f_5 f_7 f_9 f_ 10 and most 20d problem f_1 f_2 f_3 f_5 f_7 f_8 f_9
it show comp result with oth algorithm for spec cas f_4 f_6 f_8 in both 10d and 20d set consist outperform or match state-of-the-art altern
thi highlight oc-aefa s robust and versatil across divers benchmark problem .
