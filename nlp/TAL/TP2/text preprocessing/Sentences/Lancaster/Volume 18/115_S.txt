solv of frequ devy and mult object prob optim pow flow of transmit network incorp upfc control us driv train bas optim
the optim pow flow opf solv for the ie 30 bus system is being achiev whil tak therm pow tp sourc into account
in thi study the opf solv of conv pow system incorp fact dev with frequ sec constraint is investig
by incorp fact dev into the ex pow system the propos work improv the pow system s capac to transf pow and hent reduc gen cost
the object ar to reduc gen cost and emit
in ord to illust that gen and consum ar in bal the system frequ must be kept within a saf rang
theref in addit to ens the lowest produc cost und op condit the opf approach nee to provid a stabl frequ
moreov in ord to attain frequ stabl frequ sec constraint is apply to the pow dispatch problem
three scenario hav been examin in thi artic i the opf of conv system in the abs of a frequ sec constraint ii the opf of conv system in the pres of a frequ sec constraint and ii opf of conv system with the combin effect of upfc and a frequ bas sec constraint
the test outcom ind that the opf problem is bet address when upfc is combin with frequ sec constraint
to get the best solv the driv training-based optim dtbo techn has been us
aft incorp upfc with frequ bas sec constraint the fuel cost emit and frequ devy ar reduc by 0.28% 9.4% os 1.47% ss 12.9% at 50% load 0.12% 6.61% and os 1.8% ss 11.4% at 60% load 4.66% 1.68% and os 0.45% ss 1.38% at 70% load 0.41% 2.1% and os 1.3% ss 27.2% at 80% load 2.3% 5% and os 0.22% ss 1.6% at 90% load 2.32% 1.53% and os 0.55% ss 6.35% at 100% load
accord to the sim outcom it can be depict that the dtbo is bet than the biography-based optim bbo and grey wolf optim gwo
the suggest algorithm has produc bet result which hav been confirm by stat method such as box plot er bar and one-way anov analys of vary test . graph abstract
