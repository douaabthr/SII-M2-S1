neur network-driven scenario predict for adapt rout in manet us expand ring search and random ear detect
rout in mobl ad hoc network manet is complex due to their dec topolog and dynam environ
conv rout protocol frequ hav troubl maintain rely end-to-end commun lead to issu such as high packet loss unst rout and increas delay
the research pres a novel deep-learning model with hybrid optim to maintain rout stabl through stabl nod predict and optim rout discovery in a manet environ
her dynam spars recurrent-convolutional neur network dsr-cnn an adv vary of the r-cnn famy is employ to detect the stabl nod in a spars and dynam environ
the weight paramet of the dsr-cnn ar optim by the enh fick s law optim algorithm for the improv nod predict maintain rely and connect
moreov the most stabl rout ar construct through the giant trev optim optim rout expl and recovery
the model is design and sim in a python environ with the requir network set
the util of the propos research in the manet commun show 98% predict acc 2.48 ms delay 25mbps throughput and 99% of packet delivery ratio which ar mor efficy than the prevail techn s result show the highest rout stabl
thes find highlight the pot of dsr-cnn to sign improv the rely and perform of manet set a new benchmark for fut rout protocol .
