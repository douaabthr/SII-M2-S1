dendrit neuron model optim with mountain gazel optim for time-series forecast
time-series forecast predict and estim hav been act research top in rec year due to their crit rol in decision-making and fut plan
art neur network an ar wid employ for forecast apply and hav demonst sign perform improv
in thi pap we util a spec typ of an the dendrit neuron model dnm for time-series forecast
we apply an optim dnm model by util the pow of metah mh optim algorithm
spec we employ an mh algorithm the mountain gazel optim mgo to optim the paramet of the dnm improv it config process and ultim improv the acc of the forecast
furtherm we comp mgo perform with sev oth optim algorithm us to optim the dnm model
comprehend evalu ar conduc on four publ avail tim sery dataset us multipl evalu ind
the result demonst the supery of the mgo-dnm model ov compet method with optim dnm config consist outperform the tradit dnm in forecast task .
