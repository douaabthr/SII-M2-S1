adv ceemd hybrid model for vix forecast optim decid tre and arim integr
thi study focus on the tim sery analys and forecast of the volatil index vix dat in the unit stat
we employ the complet empir mod decomposit ceemd method to decompos the origin vix dat into sev intrins mod funct imf
subsequ each imf determin it station us the aug dickey-fuller adf test
for stat imf an autoregress integr mov av arim model was built whil non-stationary imf wer fit us machin learn regress algorithm
the sum of the predict valu of al imf was consid as the forecast vix valu
about the paramet select in machin learn algorithm we employ the optun libr to optim the model s paramet
we select the paramet that result in the lowest mean squ er mse on a valid set to be the optim model paramet
apply thi methodolog we found that our hybrid model has gre predict cap comp to simpl machin learn model when the market fluctu gre
spec the adaboost model outperform a bas decid tre model and a random forest model in term of mse and mae mean absolv er acc .
