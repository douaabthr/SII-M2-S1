apply of interv laplac transform in a produc system with pric and qual depend demand via wat cyc algorithm
laplac transform is a pot mathem approach util in many disciplin includ mathem engin phys and control the
it is gen us to simpl challeng mathem issu and solv diff equ
interv uncertainty is a not us in decid the risk analys and stat to express and man uncertainty in a mor flex and less spec fash
it is also known as interval-valued uncertainty or interv uncertainty analys
it diff from point estim and prec prob and is espec help when ther is littl knowledg of a vary s spec valu or when work with uncertain dat
her we apply the conceiv of interv laplac transform for solv a manufact model as wel as demand funct is tak as interv form on sel pric and the qual of the item
we hav solv the develop interv valu produc model with the help of on num exampl interv ord rel and wat cyc algorithm wca
in ord to just the result from wca we hav comp the result from oth popul metah algorithm
last an investig of post optim is being research to off som man insight .
