bezier-based expl and hexagon crossov exploit a novel metah approach
thi pap pres a novel metah algorithm aim at address the inefficy of conv approach that us a singl op and un pop to handl both expl and exploit
to achiev a mor effect search process the algorithm introduc a structured pop that is divid into two distinct group expl xpl and exploit exp . xpl ag perform glob expl by follow complex traject gen from random select bézier funct promot divers and comprehend cov of the search spac
in contrast the exp ag ar respons for loc refin upd their posit through a spec hexagon crossov op
thi op gen new candid solv within a hexagon-shaped reg by incorp inform from oth high-quality individ in the pop
by integr thes two mech each ded to eith expl or exploit the algorithm enh it abl to foc on prom reg whil maintain glob divers
the propos method was comp with sev state-of-the-art metah us a suit of shift funct spec design to challeng center-biased strategies
the expery result demonst that the algorithm consist produc a supery solv qual and fast converg whil effect avoid the typ flaw of center-biased method .
