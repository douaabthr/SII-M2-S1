elen epigenet learn through evolv neur adapt
despit the success of metah algorithm in solv complex network optim problem they oft struggle with adapt espec in dynam or high-dimensional search spac
tradit approach can becom stuck in loc optim lead to inefficy expl and suboptim solv
most of the wid acceiv adv algorithm do wel eith on high complex or smal search spac due to the lack of adapt
whil rec approach hav attempt to address adapt through vary mech they typ requir problem-specific tun or sacr gen cap for perform fail to maintain consist efficy across diff optim task and vary problem scal
to address thes limit we pres elen epigenet learn through evolv neur adapt a new evolv framework that incorp epigenet mech to enh the adapt of the cor evolv approach
elen lev compress repres of learn paramet improv dynam through epigenet tag that serv as adapt mem
three epigenet tag mut resist crossov affin and stabl scor assist with guid solv spac search facilit a mor intellig hypothes landscap expl
to assess the framework s perform we conduc expery on three crit network optim problem the travel salesm problem tsp the vehic rout problem vrp and the maxim cliqu problem mcp
expery ind that elen achiev competit result oft surpass state-of-the-art method on network optim task .
