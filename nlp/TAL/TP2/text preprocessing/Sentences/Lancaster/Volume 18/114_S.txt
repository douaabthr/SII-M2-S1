improv two-archive evolv algorithm for constrain multi-objective optim of wwtp bas on interg inform guid
maintain the bal between feas converg and divers is a challeng in constrain multi-objective optim problem for the op perform of the wastew tre process wwtp
thi pap propos an improv two-archive evolv algorithm for constrain multiobject optim c-taea bas on interg inform guid nam iig-c-taea
first the propos algorithm propos a mat select mech to fair screen elit solv in three aspect feas converg and divers
then the algorithm employ interg inform to guid offspr it by adjust crossov and mut prob and est neighb between interg pop
fin an archive-driven mech is introduc to select high-quality solv and to est an assocy between arch bas on pop inform enh the bal of divers converg and feas
the eff of the propos algorithm is confirm through comp analys conduc on benchmark problem and wastew optim problem demonst it supery ov oth constrain multi-objective optim evolv algorithm in comparison .
