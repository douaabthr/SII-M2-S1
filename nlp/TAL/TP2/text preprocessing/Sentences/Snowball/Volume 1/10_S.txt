evolutionari algorithm to simul the phylogenesi of a binari artifici immun system
four binary-encod model describ some aspect of the phylogenet evolut in an artifici immun system have been propos and analyz
the first model has focus on the evolut of a paratop s popul consid a fix group of epitop to simul a hypermut mechan and observ how the system would self-adjust to cover the epitop
in the second model the evolut involv a group of antibodi adapt to a given antigen molecul popul
the third model simul the coevolut between antibodi generat gene librari and antigen
the object was to simul somat recombin mechan to obtain final librari apt to produc antibodi to cover ani possibl antigen that would appear in the pathogen popul
in the fourth model the coevolut involv a new popul of self-molecul whose function was to establish restrict in the evolut of librari popul
for all the model implement evolutionari algorithm ea were use to form adapt nich inspir in the coevolutionari share nich strategi idea taken from a monopolist competit econom model where businessmen locat themselv among geograph distribut client so as to maxim their profit
numer experi and conclus are shown
these consider present mani similar to biolog immun system and also some inspir to solv real-world problem such as pattern recognit and knowledg discoveri in databas .
