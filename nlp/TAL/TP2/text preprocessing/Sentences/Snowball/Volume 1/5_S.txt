neuroevolut from architectur to learn
artifici neural network ann are appli to mani real-world problem rang from pattern classif to robot control
in order to design a neural network for a particular task the choic of an architectur includ the choic of a neuron model and the choic of a learn algorithm have to be address
evolutionari search method can provid an automat solut to these problem
new insight in both neurosci and evolutionari biolog have led to the develop of increas power neuroevolut techniqu over the last decad
this paper give an overview of the most promin method for evolv ann with a special focus on recent advanc in the synthesi of learn architectur .
