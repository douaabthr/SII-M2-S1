frequenc analysi for dendrit cell popul tune
the dendrit cell algorithm dca has been appli success to a divers rang of applic

the dca has perform well use unfilt signal from each environ as input
in this paper we demonstr that the dca has an emerg filter mechan caus by the manner in which the cell accumul it intern variabl
furthermor we demonstr a relationship between the migrat threshold of the cell and the transfer function of the algorithm
