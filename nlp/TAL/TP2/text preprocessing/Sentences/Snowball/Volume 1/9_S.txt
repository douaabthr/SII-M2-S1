improv the reliabl of real-tim embed system use innat immun techniqu
previous work has shown that immune-inspir techniqu have good potenti for solv problem associ with the develop of real-tim embed system rtes where for various reason tradit real-tim develop techniqu are not suitabl
this paper examin in more detail the general applic of the dendrit cell algorithm dca to the problem of task schedul in rtes
to make this possibl an understand of the problem characterist is formalis such that the result produc by the dca can be examin in relat to the overal problem difficulti
the paper then contain a detail understand of how well the dca which demonstr that it general perform well howev it clear identifi properti of anomali that are difficult to detect
these properti are as anticip base on real-tim schedul theori .
