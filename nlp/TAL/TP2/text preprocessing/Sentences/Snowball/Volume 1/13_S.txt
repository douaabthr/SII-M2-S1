a parallel immun optim algorithm for numer function optim
immun optim algorithm show good perform in obtain optim solut especi in deal with numer optim problem where such solut are often difficult to determin by tradit techniqu
this articl present the parallel suppress control algorithm psca a parallel algorithm for optim base on artifici immun system ai
psca is implement in a parallel platform where the correspond popul of antibodi is partit into subpopul that are distribut among the process
each process execut the immunity-bas algorithm for optim it subpopul
in the process of evolv the solut the activ of antibodi and the activ of the comput agent are regul by the general suppress control framework gscf which maintain and control the interact between the popul and process
the propos algorithm is evalu with benchmark problem and it perform is measur and compar with other convent optim approach .
