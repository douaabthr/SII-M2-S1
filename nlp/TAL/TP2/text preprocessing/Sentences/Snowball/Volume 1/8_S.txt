the dca some comparison
the dendrit cell algorithm dca is an immune-inspir algorithm develop for the purpos of anomali detect
the algorithm perform multi-sensor data fusion and correl which result in a context awar detect system
previous applic of the dca have includ the detect of potenti malici port scan activ where it has produc high rate of true posit and low rate of fals posit
in this work we aim to compar the perform of the dca and of a self-organ map som when appli to the detect of syn port scan through experiment analysi
a som is an ideal candid for comparison as it share similar with the dca in term of the data fusion method employ
it is shown that the result of the two system are compar and both produc fals posit for the same process
this show that the dca can produc anomali detect result to the same standard as an establish techniqu .
