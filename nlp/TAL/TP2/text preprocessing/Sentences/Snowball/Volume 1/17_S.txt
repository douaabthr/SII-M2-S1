genetic-bas approach for cue phrase select in dialogu act recognit
automat cue phrase select is a crucial step for design a dialogu act recognit model use machin learn techniqu
the approach current use are base on specif type of featur select approach call rank approach
despit their comput effici for high dimension domain they are not optim with respect to relev and redund
in this paper we propos a genetic-bas approach for cue phrase select which is essenti a variabl length genet algorithm develop to cope with the high dimension of the domain
we evalu the perform of the propos approach against sever rank approach
addit we assess it perform for the select of cue phrase enrich by phrase s type and phrase s posit
the result provid experiment evid on the abil of the genetic-bas approach to handl the drawback of the rank approach and to exploit cue s type and cue s posit inform to improv the select
furthermor we valid the use of the genetic-bas approach for machin learn applic
we use select set of cue phrase for build a dynam bayesian network model for dialogu act recognit
the result show it use for machin learn applic .
