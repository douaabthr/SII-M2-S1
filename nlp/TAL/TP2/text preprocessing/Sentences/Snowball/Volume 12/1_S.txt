hybrid of firefli algorithm and pattern search for solv optim problem
firefli algorithm fa is a newli introduc meta-heurist nature-inspir stochast algorithm for solv various type of optim problem
fa take inspir from natur phenomenon of light emiss by firefli and is one of the robust and easili implement algorithm
the standard fa consist of three stage name initi firefli posit chang stage and termin stage
a major drawback associ with standard fa in it termin stage is it failur in get the most optim valu due to the fact that after a fix number of iter no signific improv can be observ in the solut qualiti
in this paper this issu is resolv by introduc pattern search ps at the termin stage of standard fa when there is no further improv in the solut qualiti
the propos approach consist of three stage
in the first stage the paramet of standard fa are initi
in the firefli chang posit stage the random factor is use to updat the solut in each iter of oper stage
in the final stage the optim valu obtain from the fa dure it maximum number of iter are given as input to the pattern search algorithm
the pattern search is an optim algorithm that further optim the valu obtain in the maximum iter of standard fa
the propos techniqu has been name as fa-p in which ps has been use to introduc enhanc in the solut qualiti of standard fa
the develop approach has been appli to various type of maxim and minim function and the perform has been compar with standard fa and genet algorithm in term of get the most optim valu for the function be consid
a signific improv has been observ in the solut qualiti of fa .
