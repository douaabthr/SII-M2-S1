cloud model base sine cosin algorithm for solv optim problem
sine cosin algorithm sca is a recent develop optim techniqu which use sine function and cosin function as oper to find the global optim solut
howev proper paramet set is a challeng task
onli use the number of iter to adjust the algorithm paramet cannot fulli reflect the converg inform in the evolut process so sca lack the adapt in solv differ optim problem
to address this issu a cloud model base sine cosin algorithm csca is propos
in csca the cloud model is use to adjust the control paramet adapt while keep sca algorithm framework unchang
the perform of the present csca method is evalu use 13 benchmark test function with differ dimens
experiment result demonstr that the propos algorithm is superior to other sca variant in term of robust and scalabl .
