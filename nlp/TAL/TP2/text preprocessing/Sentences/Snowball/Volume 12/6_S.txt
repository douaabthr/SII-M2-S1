optim regular linear discrimin analysi for featur extract in face recognit
in a reduc dimension space linear discrimin analysi look for a project transform that can maxim separ among class
sinc linear discrimin analysi demand the within-class scatter matrix appear to non-singular which cannot direct use in condit of small sampl size sss issu in which the dimens of imag is much higher while the number of sampl isn t unlimit
both the between-class and within-class scatter matric are alway exceed ill-pos in sss problem
and mani algorithm are suffer from small sampl size issu still
to solv sss problem mani method includ regular linear discrimin analysi were propos
in this articl a way was present by optim regular linear discrimin analysi for featur extract in fr which can not onli fix the singular problem exist in scatter matrix but also the problem of paramet estim
the experi is conduct on sever databas and promis result are obtain compar to some state-of-the-art method to demonstr the effect of the propos approach .
