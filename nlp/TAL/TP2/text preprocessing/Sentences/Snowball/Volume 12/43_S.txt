gender recognit use four statist featur techniqu a compar studi of perform
nowaday mani applic use biometr system as a secur purpos
these system use fingerprint iri retina hand geometri etc
that have uniqu pattern from person to anoth
the human face is one of the most import organ that has mani physiolog characterist such as the subject gender race age and mood
determin the gender of the face can reduc the process time of large-scal face-bas system and may improv the perform
mani studi were propos for gender recognit but sever were evalu use the accuraci as a perform metric which is improp for unbalanc data
further they use a grayscal color and extract featur either from the whole imag or equal divid block as a grid
in this paper novel method are propos base on statist featur that have the abil to repres the face landmark
these featur are gist pyramid histogram of orient gradient gist base on discret cosin transform and princip compon analysi that are extract use face local region
the perform are evalu use area-under-the-curv that is comput from the receiv oper characterist or roc curv
at the end the acquir perform has been compar by two state-of-the-art techniqu that show that the propos approach enhanc the perform between 1 and 3% but the number of featur is increas .
