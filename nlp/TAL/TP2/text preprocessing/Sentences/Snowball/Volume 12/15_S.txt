cross domain associ use transfer subspac learn
transfer learn has gain more attent recent by util knowledg acquir from one domain to advanc a learn perform in anoth domain
exist homogen transfer learn method have progress to a point where featur space are common in train and test domain
howev heterogen transfer learn is still in it nascent stage where featur of train and test domain are differ
take this into account bregman diverg regular is use to minim the probabl distribut differ between train and test domain and to take them togeth to a share subspac
to discrimin data within individu domain a project matrix is obtain use fisher linear discrimin analysi subspac learn algorithm
experiment is perform on two effici use biometr the face and fingerprint
two type of cross-domain set are use 1 face finger2fing where train sampl come from face label sampl and fingerprint unlabel sampl data set while test is perform on a fingerprint dataset
2 finger face2fac where train sampl come from fingerprint label sampl and face unlabel sampl data set while test is perform on a face dataset
this paper propos a cross domain associ between face and fingerprint that find util in forens applic .
