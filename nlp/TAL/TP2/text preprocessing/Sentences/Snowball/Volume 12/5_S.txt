a movabl damp wave algorithm for solv global optim problem
this paper present a new optim methodolog call movabl damp wave algorithm for solv global optim problem
the propos methodolog mimic mathemat the behavior of waveform induc by oscil phenomena
it start by creat multipl initi random solut which are updat through introduc a mathemat model base on a damp wave function
in the propos methodolog the updat mechan of solut are base on design a mathemat relat for the movabl wave with the aim to effect achiev robust solut
therefor this methodolog can be more robust statist sound and converg quick to the optim global solut
the perform of the propos is valid by carri out on 23 benchmark problem and three engin design problem
the result show vivid that the propos is a reliabl algorithm and outperform the compar algorithm in most case .
