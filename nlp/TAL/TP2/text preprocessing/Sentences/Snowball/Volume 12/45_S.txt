spectrum sens in cognit radio network use kernel recurs least squar
cognit radio cr environ help in solv the spectrum scarciti by predict the avail channel through the cooper spectrum sens
spectrum sens is consid to be one of the prime task in cr environ and mani research have contribut for the same
in this paper a cooper spectrum sens css environ for the cr has been develop to determin the channel avail for the communic
here a predict model name hybrid cooper spectrum sens hkrls has been propos for detect the channel avail
initi a hybrid mixtur model is develop by deriv the eigen statist of the cr environ and the statist are provid to the hkrls predictor
the propos hkrls predict algorithm is an improv over the kernel recurs least squar krls as the propos algorithm contain sever kernel function for the predict
the propos hkrls model is implement by consid four differ channel for the simul and evalu base on metric such as probabl of detect and probabl of the fals alarm
the simul result of the propos hkrls scheme is compar with other compar model and the result prove that the model achiev improv channel estim .
