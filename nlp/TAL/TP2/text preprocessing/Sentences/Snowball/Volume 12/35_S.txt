a stage approach to evolv real-world uav control
a testb has recent been introduc that evolv control for arbitrari hover-cap uav with evalu occur direct on the robot
to prepar the testb for real-world deploy we investig the effect of state-spac limit brought about by physic tether which prevent damag to the uav dure stochast tune on the general of the evolv control
we identifi generalis issu in some control and propos an improv method that compris two stage in the first stage control are evolv as normal use standard tether but experi are termin when the popul display basic flight compet
optimis then continu on a much less restrict tether effect free-fli and is allow to explor a larger state-spac envelop
we compar the two method on a hover task use a real uav and show that more general solut are generat in fewer generat use the two-stag approach
a secondari experi undertak a sensit analysi of the evolv control .
