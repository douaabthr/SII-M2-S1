a gas sourc local algorithm base on nls initi optim of particl filter
a gas sourc local algorithm base on the initi nls valu optim of particl filter pf-nls is propos to solv the problem that the posit accuraci of nls algorithm is reduc due to rough initi valu estim and improp weight alloc of node
first the state space model of the system is establish by use the gas turbul diffus model the particl weight is updat by construct the likelihood function and then the initi posit and initi sourc strength of the gas sourc are obtain by use the nls algorithm
final the true inform of the gas sourc is accur estim by use the pf-nls algorithm
the simul result show that compar with nls the algorithm has higher posit accuraci further improv the converg speed of the algorithm by optim the initi valu and can be well appli to practic scenario .
