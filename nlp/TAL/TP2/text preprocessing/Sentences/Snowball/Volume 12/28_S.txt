the build of the librari constitut a local librari cloud platform use web technolog to achiev the schedul of local librari and then implement the most common resourc retriev servic in the librari on the cloud platform framework and final discuss issu that need attent in the follow-up develop of the platform
final a multi-ag share model for educ inform resourc under the cloud-comput environ has establish to serv the construct of librari inform resourc better
in addit this articl innov put forward the function of librari construct of employ inform servic for colleg student which is better to serv colleg student .
