unsupervis genet program base linkag rule ugplr miner for entiti link in semant web
in the past decad the semant web data communiti has focus on publish and interlink data
data public is now wide done activ but more effort need to be devot to interlink data sourc
organ have been publish data use differ data curat and public polici that have result in the prolifer of data sourc
this prolifer has brought sever challeng in interlink data sourc
differ data sourc use differ properti descript to describ the same entiti
entiti link problem is at the core of data interlink it identifi and link instanc record refer to the same real-world entiti
the state-of-the-art entiti link approach are base on supervis learn
supervis approach reli on the label data for a better learn model and suffer in the absenc of label data
the cost of label is high and it is infeas to carri out manual label process for dataset have billion of record
in this work the author have propos a simpl heuristic-bas approach to generat the label data
the propos approach use automat generat label data to train an under genet program base linkag rule-learn model
the propos approach is scalabl for larg dataset and achiev compar perform to other supervis approach while elimin the need for label data
the propos approach work in the unsupervis fulli automat way at the same time keep the advantag of supervis approach such as high accuraci and less complex
experiment analysi prove that the propos approach is effect than mani state of the art approach .
