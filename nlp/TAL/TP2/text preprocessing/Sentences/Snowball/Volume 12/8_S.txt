increment supervis learn algorithm and applic in pattern recognit
the most effect well-known method in the context of static machin learn offer no altern to evolut and dynam adapt to integr new data or to restructur problem alreadi partial learn
in this area the increment learn repres an interest altern and constitut an open research field becom one of the major concern of the machin learn and classif communiti
in this paper we studi increment supervis learn techniqu and their applic especi in the field of pattern recognit
this articl present an overview of the main concept and supervis algorithm of increment learn includ a synthesi of research studi done in this field and focus on neural network decis tree and support vector machin .
