opposit eleph herd optim with dynam cauchi mutat for multilevel imag threshold
this paper present an improv eleph herd optim ieho to solv the multilevel imag threshold problem for imag segment by introduc oppositional-bas learn obl and dynam cauchi mutat dcm
obl acceler the converg rate and enhanc the perform of standard eho wherea dcm mitig the prematur converg
the suggest optim approach maxim two popular object function kapur s entropi and between-class varianc to estim optim threshold valu for segment of the imag
the perform of the propos techniqu is verifi on a set of test imag taken from the benchmark berkeley segment dataset
the result are analyz and compar with convent eho and other four popular recent metaheurist algorithm name cuckoo search artifici bee coloni bat algorithm particl swarm optim and one classic method name dynam program found from the literatur
experiment result show that the propos ieho provid promis perform compar to other method in view of optim fit valu peak signal-to-nois ratio structur similar index and featur similar index
the suggest algorithm also has better converg than the other method taken into consider .
