multi-moth flame optim for solv the link predict problem in complex network
provid a solut for the link predict problem attract sever comput scienc field and becom a popular challeng in research
this challeng is present by introduc sever approach keen to provid the most precis predict qualiti within a short period of time
the difficulti of the link predict problem come from the spars natur of most complex network such as social network
this paper present a parallel metaheurist framework which is base on moth-flam optim mfo cluster and pre-process dataset to solv the link predict problem
this framework is implement and test on a high-perform comput cluster and carri out on larg and complex network from differ field such as social citat biolog and inform and public network
this framework is call parallel mfo for link predict pmfo-lp
pmfo-lp is compos of data preprocess stage and predict stage
dataset divis with stratifi sampl featur extract data under-sampl and featur select are perform in the data preprocess stage
in the predict stage the mfo base on cluster is use as the predict optim
the pmfo-lp provid a solut to the link predict problem with more accur predict result within a reason amount of time
experiment result show that pmfo-lp algorithm outperform other well-regard algorithm in term of error rate the area under curv and speedup
note that the sourc code of the pmfo-lp algorithm is avail athttp github . com/rehambarham/pmfo_mpi . cpp .
