robust evolv and phenotyp complex insight from evolv digit circuit
we analyz the relat between robust to mutat phenotyp complex and evolv in the context of artifici circuit evolv for the abil to solv a pariti problem
we demonstr that whether robust to mutat enhanc or diminish phenotyp variabl and evolv depend on whether robust is achiev through the develop of parsimoni phenotyp simpl solut that minim the number of gene play function role or through phenotyp more complex solut capabl of buffer the effect of mutat
we show that the characterist of the select process strong influenc the robust and the perform of the evolv candid solut
final we propos a new evolutionari method that outperform evolutionari algorithm common use in this domain .
