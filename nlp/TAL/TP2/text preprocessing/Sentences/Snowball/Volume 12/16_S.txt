emperor penguin coloni a new metaheurist algorithm for optim
a metaheurist is a high-level problem independ algorithm framework that provid a set of guidelin or strategi to develop heurist optim algorithm
metaheurist algorithm attempt to find the best solut out of all possibl solut of an optim problem
a veri activ area of research is the design of nature-inspir metaheurist
natur act as a sourc of concept mechan and principl for design of artifici comput system to deal with complex comput problem
in this paper a new metaheurist algorithm inspir by the behavior of emperor penguin which is call emperor penguin coloni epc is propos
this algorithm is control by the bodi heat radiat of the penguin and their spiral-lik movement in their coloni
the propos algorithm is compar with eight develop metaheurist algorithm
ten benchmark test function are appli to all algorithm
the result of the experi to find the optim result show that the propos algorithm is better than other metaheurist algorithm .
