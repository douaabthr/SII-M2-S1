a brief histori of learn classifi system from cs-1 to xcs and it variant
the direct set by wilson s xcs is that modern learn classifi system can be character by their use of rule accuraci as the util metric for the search algorithm s discov use rule
such search typic take place within the restrict space of co-act rule for effici
this paper give an overview of the evolut of learn classifi system up to xcs and then of some of the subsequ develop of wilson s algorithm to differ type of learn .
