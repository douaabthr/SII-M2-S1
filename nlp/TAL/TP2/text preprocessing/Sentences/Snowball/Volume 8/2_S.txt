a semant network-bas evolutionari algorithm for comput creativ
we introduc a novel evolutionari algorithm ea with a semant network-bas represent
for enabl this we establish new formul of ea variat oper crossov and mutat that we adapt to work on semant network
the algorithm employ commonsens reason to ensur all oper preserv the meaning of the network use conceptnet and wordnet knowledg base
the algorithm can be interpret as a novel memet algorithm ma given that 1 individu repres piec of inform that undergo evolut as in the origin sens of memet as it was introduc by dawkin and 2 this is differ from exist ma where the word memet has been use as a synonym for local refin after global optim
for evalu the approach we introduc an analog similarity-bas fit measur that is comput through structur map
this setup enabl the open-end generat of network analog to a given base network .
