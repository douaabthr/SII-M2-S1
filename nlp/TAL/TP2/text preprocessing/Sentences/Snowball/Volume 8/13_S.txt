an on-lin pittsburgh lcs for the three-corn coevolut framework
the three-corn coevolut framework describ a method that is capabl of address classif task through coevolut coadapt evolut where three differ agent i. e
a generat agent and two classif agent learn and adapt to the chang of the problem without human involv
here artifici problem can be generat in concert with classif agent in order to provid insight into their relationship
previous work on the two-corn coevolut framework provid foundat for implement the system that was abl to set-up the problem s difficulti appropri while trigger the coevolutionari process
howev the trigger process was set manual without utilis the third agent as propos in the origin framework to perform this task
previous work on the three-corn coevolut introduc the third agent a new classif agent to trigger the coevolutionari process within the system where it function and effect on the system requir investig
this paper detail the implement for this case two classif agent that use differ style of learn techniqu e. g
supervis versus reinforc learn techniqu is adapt in the classif agent to learn the various classif problem
ultim learn classifi system lcs is chosen to be implement in the particip agent
lcs has sever potenti characterist such as interpret general capabl and variat in represent that are suitabl for the system
experi show that the pittsburgh-styl lcs with the adapt of tabu search techniqu in s capabl to autonom adjust the problem s difficulti and generat a wide rang of problem for classif
the adapt of a-plus to an on-lin system is success implement
further the classif agent i. e
r and i are abl to solv the classif task where the classif perform are vari
the three-corn coevolut framework offer a great potenti for autonom learn and provid use insight into coevolut learn over the standard studi of pattern recognit
the system is capabl of autonom generat various problem learn and provid insight into each learn system s abil by determin the problem domain where they perform relat well
this is in contrast to human have to determin the problem domain .
