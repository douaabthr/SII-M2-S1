xcsf with local delet prevent detriment forget
the xcsf classifi system iter solv regress problem with a popul of overlap local approxim
we show that problem solut stabil and accuraci may be lost in particular set main due to xcsf s global delet
we introduc local delet which prevent these detriment effect to larg extent
we show experiment that local delet can prevent forget in various problem particular where the problem space is non-uniform or non-independ sampl
while we use xcsf with hyper-ellipsoid recept field and linear approxim herein local delet can be appli to ani xcs version where local can be similar defin
for futur work we propos to appli xcsf with local delet to unbalanc non-uniform distribut local sampl problem with complex manifold structur within which vari target error valu may be reach select .
