fraud is a serious problem that cost the worldwid economi billion of dollar annual
howev fraud detect is difficult as perpetr activ attempt to mask their action among typic overwhelm larg volum of legitim activ
in this paper we investig the fraud detect problem and examin how learn classifi system can be appli to it
we describ the common properti of fraud introduc an abstract problem which can be tune to exhibit those characterist
we report experi on this abstract problem with a popular real-tim learn classifi system algorithm result from our experi demonstr that this approach can overcom the difficulti inher to the fraud detect problem
final we appli the algorithm to a real-world problem and show that it can achiev good perform in this domain .
