kernel represent for evolv continu function
to parameter continu function for evolutionari learn we use kernel expans in nest sequenc of function space of grow complex
this approach is particular power when deal with non-convex constraint and discontinu object function
kernel method offer a number of benefici properti for parameter continu function such as smooth and local which make them attract as a basi for mutat oper
beyond such practic consider kernel method make heavi use of inner product in function space and offer a well establish regular framework
we show how evolutionari comput can profit from these properti
search function space of iter increas complex allow the solut to evolv from a simpl first guess to a complex and high refin function
at transit point where the evolut strategi is confront with the next level of function complex the kernel framework can be use to project the search distribut into the extend search space
the feasibl of the method is demonstr on challeng trajectori plan problem where redund robot have to avoid obstacl .
