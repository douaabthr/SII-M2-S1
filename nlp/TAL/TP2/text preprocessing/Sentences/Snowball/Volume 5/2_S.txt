evolv a-typ artifici neural network
we investig ture s notion of an a-typ artifici neural network
we studi a refin of ture s origin idea motiv by work of teuscher bull preen and copeland
our a-typ can process binari data by accept and output sequenc of binari vector henc we can associ a function to an a-typ and we say the a-typerepresentsth function
there are two mode of data process clamp and sequenti
we describ an evolutionari algorithm involv graph-theoret manipul of a-typ which search for a-typ repres a given function
the algorithm use both mutat and crossov oper
we implement the algorithm and appli it to three benchmark task
we found that the algorithm perform much better than a random search
for two out of the three task the algorithm with crossov perform better than a mutation-on version .
