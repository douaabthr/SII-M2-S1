product system rule as protein complex from genet regulatori network an initi studi
this short paper introduc a new way by which to design product system rule
an indirect encod scheme is present which view such rule as protein complex produc by the tempor behaviour of an artifici genet regulatori network
this initi studi begin by use a simpl boolean regulatori network to produc tradit ternary-encod rule befor move to a fuzzi variant to produc real-valu rule
competit perform is shown with relat genet regulatori network and rule-bas system on benchmark problem .
