toward the evolut of vertical-axi wind turbin use supershap
we have recent present an initi studi of evolutionari algorithm use to design vertical-axi wind turbin vawt wherein candid prototyp are evalu under fan generat wind condit after be physic instanti by a 3d printer
that is unlik other approach such as comput fluid dynam simul no mathemat formul are use and no model assumpt are made
howev the represent use signific restrict the rang of morpholog explor
in this paper we present initi explor into the use of a simpl generat encod known as gieli superformula that produc a high flexibl 3d shape represent to design vawt
first the target-bas evolut of 3d artefact is investig and subsequ initi design experi are perform wherein each vawt candid is physic instanti and evalu under fan generat wind condit
it is shown possibl to produc veri close match design of a number of 3d object through the evolut of supershap produc by gieli superformula
moreov it is shown possibl to use artifici physic evolut to identifi novel and increas effici supershap vawt design .
