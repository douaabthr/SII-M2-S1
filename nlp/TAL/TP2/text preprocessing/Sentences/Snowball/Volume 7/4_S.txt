reconstruct biolog gene regulatori network where optim meet big data
the import of big data in biolog is increas as vast quantiti of data are be produc from high-throughput experi
techniqu such as dna microarray are provid a genome-wid pictur of gene express level allow us to investig the structur and interact of gene network in biolog system
infer of gene regulatori network grn is an underdetermin problem suit to metaheurist algorithm which can oper on limit inform
thus grn infer offer a platform for investig into data intens scienc and larg scale optim problem
here we examin the link between data intens research and optim problem for the revers engin of grns
briefli we detail the benefit of the data delug and the studi of alif for model grns as well as their reconstruct
we discuss how metaheurist can solv big data problem and the infer of grns offer real world problem for both area of research
we overview some current reconstruct algorithm and investig some model and comput limit of the infer process and suggest some area for develop
furthermor we identifi link and synergi between optim and big data e.g. dynam uncertain and larg scale optim problem and discuss the potenti benefit of multi and many-object optim
we stress the import of data integr techniqu in order to maxim the data avail particular for the case of infer grns from microarray data
such multi-disciplinari research is vital as biolog is rapid becom a quantit data intens scienc .
