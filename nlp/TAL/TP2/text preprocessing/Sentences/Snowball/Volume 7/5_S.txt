evolution-in-materio evolv comput in materi
evolution-in-materio eim is the manipul of a physic system by comput control evolut cce
it take the posit that to obtain use function from a physic system one need to appli high specif physic signal and place the system in a particular physic state
it argu that cce is an effect methodolog for do this
one of the potenti advantag of this is that artifici evolut can potenti exploit physic effect that are either too complex to understand or hitherto unknown
eim is most common use as a methodolog for implementingcomputationin physic system
the method is a hybrid of analogu and classic comput in that it use classic comput to program physic system or analogu devic
thus far eim has onli been attempt in a rather limit set of physic and chemic system
this review paper examin past work relat to eim and discuss histor underpin behind such work
it describ latest develop give an analysi of the advantag and disadvantag of such work and the challeng that still remain .
