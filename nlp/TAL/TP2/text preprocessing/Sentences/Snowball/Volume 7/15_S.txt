advanc genet algorithm approach to field programm gate array placement with enhanc recombin oper
sinc their incept field programm gate array have seen an enorm growth in usag becaus they can dramat reduc design and manufactur cost
howev the time requir for placement a key step in the design is domin the compil process
in this paper we take some initi theoret step toward develop an effici genet algorithm for solv the placement problem by develop suitabl recombin oper for perform placement
accord to holland when the genet algorithm recombin two parent genotyp the differ between them defin a genotyp subspac and ani offspr produc should be confin to this subspac
those recombin oper that violat this principl can direct a search away from the region contain the parent genotyp and this is contrari to the intend task for recombin
this is often detriment to search perform
this paper contribut the develop of an intuit visual techniqu that can be use to easili detect violat of the previous principl
the efficaci of the propos methodolog is demonstr and it is demonstr that mani standard recombin oper violat this principl
the methodolog is then use to guid the develop of novel oper that exhibit substanti and statist signific improv in perform over standard recombin oper .
