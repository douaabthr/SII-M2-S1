perform analysi of rough set ensembl of learn classifi system with differenti evolut base rule discoveri
data mine and specif supervis data classif is a key applic area for learn classifi system lcs
scale to larger classif problem especi to higher dimension problem is a key challeng
ensembl base approach can be appli to lcs to address scalabl issu
to this end a rough set base ensembl of lcs is propos which reli on a pre-process featur partit step to train multipl lcs on featur subspac
each base classifi in the ensembl is a michigan style supervis lcs
the tradit genet algorithm base rule evolut is replac by a differenti evolut base rule discoveri to improv generalis capabl of lcs
a vote mechan is then use to generat output for test instanc
this paper describ the propos ensembl algorithm in detail and compar it perform with differ version of base lcs on a number of benchmark classif task
analysi of comput time and model accuraci show the relat merit of the ensembl algorithm and base classifi on the test data set
the rough set base ensembl learn approach and differenti evolut base rule search out-perform the base lcs on classif accuraci over the data set consid
result also show that small ensembl size is suffici to obtain good perform .
