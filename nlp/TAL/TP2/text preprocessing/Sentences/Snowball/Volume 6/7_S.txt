adapt artifici dataset through learn classifi system for classif task
in produc an artifici dataset human usual play a major role in creat and control the problem domain
in particular human set up and tune the problem s difficulti
if human can set up the difficulti level appropri then learn system can solv classif task success
this paper introduc an autonom classif problem generat approach
the problem s difficulti is adapt base on the classif agent s perform within the defin attribut
an autom problem generat has been creat to evolv simul dataset whilst the classif agent in this case a learn classifi system lcs attempt to learn the evolv dataset
the idea here is to tune the problem s difficulti autonom such that the problem s characterist may be determin effect
furthermor this framework can empir test the learn bound of the classif agent whilst lower human involv
initi tabu search was integr in the problem generat to discov the best combin of domain featur in order to adjust the problem s difficulti
in order to overcom stagnat in local optimum a pittsburgh-styl lcss a-plus was adapt for the first time to the problem generat
in this way the effect of the problem s characterist e. g
nois which alter the classif agent s perform becom human readabl
experi confirm that the problem generat was abl to tune the problem s difficulti either to make the problem harder or easier so that it can either increas or decreas the classif agent s perform .
