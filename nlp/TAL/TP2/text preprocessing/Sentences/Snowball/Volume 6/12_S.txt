a compar studi the effect of the perturb vector type in the differenti evolut algorithm on the accuraci of robot pose and head estim
evolutionari algorithm ea belong to a group of classic optim these day and can be use in mani applic area
autonom mobil robot is not an except
ea are util profus for the purpos of local and map build of unknown environ slam
this paper concentr on one particular class of ea the so call differenti evolut de
it address the problem of select a suitabl set of paramet valu for the de algorithm appli to the task of continu robot local in a known environ under the presenc of addit nois in sensori data
the primari goal of this studi is to find at least one type of perturb vector from a set of known perturb vector type suitabl to navig a robot use 2d laser scanner 2dls sensori system
the basic navig algorithm use in this studi use a vector represent for both the data and the environ map which is use as a refer data sourc for the navig
sinc the algorithm doe not use a probabl occup grid the precis of the result is not limit by the grid resolut
the compar studi present in this paper includ a relat larg amount of experi in various type of environ
the result of the studi suggest that the de algorithm is a suitabl tool for continu robot local task in an indoor environ with or without move object and under the presenc of various level of addit nois in sensori data
two perturb vector type were found as the most suitabl for this task on averag name rand/1/exp and randtobest/1/bin .
