algorithm for speech emot recognit classif base on mel-frequ cepstral coeffici and broad learn system
speech play a major role in emot transmit inform in human and speech emot recognit has becom an import part of the human comput system especi in specif system with high requir for real-tim and accuraci
to improv the accuraci and real-tim of speech emot recognit peopl have done a lot of work in speech emot featur extract and speech emot recognit algorithm but the recognit rate also need improv
in this paper we propos a speech emot recognit method base on mel-frequ cepstral coeffici mfcc and broad learn network
39 dimension mfcc featur were extract after preprocess of the speech signal
after label and standard the data a data predict model is built
final the data set is split into train and test data onto a certain ratio 0.8
we experi with broad learn network architectur
and then the data process in the broad learn network is improv
the propos algorithm is a neural network structur that doe not reli on deep structur which has a small amount of calcul excel calcul speed and simpl structur
the experiment result show that the propos network architectur achiev higher accuraci and it turn out to be the most accur in recogn emot in casia chines emot corpus
the recognit rate can reach 100%
therefor the propos network architectur provid an effect method of speech emot recognit .
