a cloud model base symbiot organ search algorithm for dg alloc in radial distribut network
recent metaheurist algorithm have becom popular in solv dg placement problem due to it advantag of simpl implement and abil to find the near optim solut for complex and large-scal optim problem
symbiot organ search sos is one of the latest metaheurist algorithm introduc to solv dg placement problem
unlik mani other metaheurist algorithm sos is simpl to implement and doe not use ani control paramet which lead to enhanc perform stabil
howev like other optim algorithm sos suffer with local optim and stagnat which affect it accuraci and converg especi in solv real world problem like dg placement problem
this work attempt to enhanc perform of sos by combin with cloud-bas model
the propos algorithm is name cloud base model symbiot organ search cmsos
in cmsos cloud-bas theori have been use to generat random number oper in mutual phase of the origin sos
to assess the perform of cmsos in solv optim problem 26 benchmark function with differ dimens have been use
the perform of the propos algorithm has been test for real world dg placement problem
the perform analysi such as statist converg and complex measur show superior of the propos algorithm compar to the studi algorithm .
