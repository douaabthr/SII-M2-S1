holoentropi base correl naiv bay classifi and mapreduc model for classifi the big data
big data is the recent immin technolog which can provid larg benefit to the busi administr
owe to such huge volum it becom veri complic to ensur effect analysi by the exist techniqu
the complic can be relat to analyz captur share storag and visual of the data
to tackl these challeng a novel classif techniqu use holoentropi base correl naiv bay classifi and mapreduc model hcnb-mrm is propos
the propos hcnb which is design by combin the holoentropi function with the correl base naiv bay classifi deal with both high-dimension data set as well as extens dataset to improv the benchmark and classifi the data base on depend assumpt
therefor the propos hcnb-mrm is use to make the process simpler and to choos the best featur from big dataset
the propos hcnb with the mapreduc model maxim the perform of big data classif use probabl index tabl and posterior probabl of the test data sampl
the perform of the propos hcnb-mrm is evalu use three metric such as accuraci sensit and specif
from the experiment result it is analyz that the propos hcnb-mrm obtain a high classif accuraci of 93.5965% and 94.3369% for the local dataset and skin dataset when compar with the exist techniqu .
