impact of sisal fiber reinforc concret and it perform analysi a review
sisal fiber cement is comprehens deploy in the construct work owe to their flexibl as clad panel and ridg equip and water contain that are access in a massiv number of cultiv and construct applic
the most import reason for integr the sisal fiber into the cement matrix is to increas the tough tensil strength and the bend featur of the result composit
in recent time the sisal fiber have been employ as reinforc in concret
these cementiti composit are present deliber to be one of the most accomplish structur equip in the modern industri technolog
accord in the present survey sever paper are taken for analyz the perform of sisal fiber
in addit the paper taken for review are studi depend on the composit of concret and sisal constitu in the work of art of build
moreov the sisal fiber with a composit other than concret is also illustr
the contribut regard the tensil strength and compress strength in the adopt paper are analyz togeth with their percentag of composit
the evolut of the adopt paper along with their various applic are moreov analyz in detail .
