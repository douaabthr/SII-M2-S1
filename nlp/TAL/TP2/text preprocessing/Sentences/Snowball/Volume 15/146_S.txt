applic of morpholog wavelet and permut entropi in gear fault recognit
in this paper a new gear fault recognit method was propos by use morpholog wavelet and permut entropi
first the morpholog haar wavelet was propos base on morpholog wavelet and it was use to pre-process the measur gear vibrat signal
then the permut entropi was use as the eigenvalu of gear fault to be extract from the vibrat signal which includ four work condit normal mild wear moder wear and broken teeth
final accord to differ fault correspond to differ permut entropi distribut the various fault state were classifi and the permut entropi distribut of non-denois signal were compar
it could be seen that the morpholog haar wavelet had good de-nois effect and permut entropi could express the featur of differ gear condit
the exampl of gear fault recognit prove that the combin of morpholog wavelet and permut entropi could effect improv the abil of gear fault classif .
