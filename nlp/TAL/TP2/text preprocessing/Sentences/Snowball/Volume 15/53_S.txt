optim decis tree rule use diverg base grey wolf optim for big data classif in health care
most of the organ are main focus on larg dataset for automat mine of necessari inform from big medic data
the major issu of the big medic data is about it complex data set and volum which is gradual increas
this paper intend to propos a big data classif model heart diseas in health care which includ certain phase or step
the step are as follow 1 map-reduc framework 2 support vector machin svm 3 optim decis tree classifi dt
initi the big data is suppli as the input to the mapreduc framework where it reduc the data content through some major oper
this framework use the principl compon analysi to reduc the dimens of data
the reduc data is subject to svm where it output the class
the output data from svm is process with a new contribut call data transform that pave way for optim rule generat in decis tree classifi
the advanc optim concept is involv in this process to optim the weight and integ in data transform
this paper introduc a new algorithm name diverg base grey wolf optim dgwo
final the transform data is subject to dt where the classif take place
the propos dgwo model is compar over other convent method like firefli algorithm artifici bee coloni algorithm particl swarm optim algorithm genet algorithm and grey wolf optim algorithm .
