optim featur select and hybrid deep learn for direct market campaign in bank applic
as state by a mass market techniqu the object of market-bas compani is to maxim the product of target direct market campaign other than reach prospect and custom differ
the maximum return of the direct market campaign is base on an appropri predict of the respons rate and an elabor descript of the prospect
this paper plan to develop a new direct market campaign model in bank applic use a hybrid deep learn architectur
the propos model consist of sever step like a data acquisit b optim featur select and c predict
initi the direct market campaign data correspond to bank applic are collect from other googl site like portugues bank institut
with the collect inform optim featur select is perform in order to reduc the dimens of the attribut or featur vector thus can reduc the complex of the predict algorithm
here the optim featur select is perform by a new variant of a meta-heurist algorithm term as self adaptive-sea lion optim sa-slno algorithm
further the optim collect featur are subject to deep hybrid learn with the integr of deep belief network dbn and recurr neural network rnn
as an improv to the deep learn model the hidden neuron of both dbn and rnn are optim by the same sa-slno
the outcom of the hybrid classifi is the decis of the custom on bank deposit
final the perform of the propos model is certifi by compar over the convent method through the evalu of relev perform measur .
