automat sleep stage classif with reduc epoch of eeg
in the recent year analysi of electroencephalogram eeg signal has play vital role in automat sleep score techniqu
classif of sleep stage help in understand sleep relat issu
manual analysi of sleep score is cost tedious and time-consum process
it is essenti to design an automat sleep score techniqu which is conveni to patient and simplifi the diagnost process use eeg signal
implement of such techniqu enabl expert to identifi sleep relat issu
in this paper eeg signal are record for 60 subject and preprocess use infinit impuls respons iir filter
sleep stage are classifi into three major stage viz stage 1 2 and 3 with 10 s epoch durat use statist featur of eeg and machin learn algorithm with five-fold cross valid
propos method is more feasibl for physician to diagnos sleep disord and prove to be the better techniqu with improv accuraci compar to other exist studi .
