a novel edg boost approach for imag super-resolut
imag super-resolut is high demand area in both research as well as industri
in this paper a novel deep network to acquir the high-resolut imag from the input low-resolut imag has been propos
the propos a novel residual-edg modul is use to build the network for singl imag super resolut
the residual-edg modul compris of tradit residu learn follow by the propos edg boost mechan
the propos edg boost mechan propag differ between the residu featur map across the network with dens connect
the propos edg boost mechan enhanc the edg content in the featur map learn by the residu block
this studi use condit generat adversari network framework to optim the weight paramet
experi have been carri out on benchmark databas to valid the propos network for imag super-resolut
empir result show that the propos network perform better other exist method for imag super-resolut .
