fuzzy-bas decis approach for call admiss control in the lte network
long term evolut lte is a user-friend network in provid a user request servic and the growth of lte is report exponenti due to the attract applic
the exist of the huge number of user and a massiv presenc of user demand in the network rais a question on the quality-of-servic qos
in order to assur the requir qos with the avail resourc in the network the paper propos a call admiss control scheme use a fuzzy-bas decis approach
the propos method work base on the avail resourc in the network and alloc extra resourc block when there is a lag in the demand qos
the flexibl and user-friend servic is assur to three group of user for which the user are categor base on the request servic as soon the servic is request
the simul environ is develop to perform the fuzzy-bas call admiss control in lte such that the result prove that the propos method outperform the exist method in term of delay throughput cell power and call drop
the delay throughput cell power and call drop use the propos method are 0.1103 s 1,294 932 bps 44.2071 dbm and 328 respect
also the propos method has the minimum call block probabl of 0.0527 and 0.2901 for handoff user and new user
it has the call drop probabl of 0.0528 and 0.3357 for handoff user and new user respect .
