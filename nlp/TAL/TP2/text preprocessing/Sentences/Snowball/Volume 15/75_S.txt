roadmap to distilleri spent wash treatment and use of soft comput techniqu
distilleri industri in sever region all over the world pose a serious risk as it generat unpleas compound
under such circumst it seek an effect spent wash treatment to elimin the contamin
accord this paper provid a relev review regard the distilleri spent wash treatment associ with the proper treatment and coagul
at first it review 67 recent research paper from which 24 paper belong to distilleri spent wash treatment and remain belong to other treatment
further it extend the valuabl chronolog review on distilleri spent wash treatment
in addit it describ the sever process such as anaerob treatment aerob treatment nanofiltr revers osmosi adsorpt and electrochem treatment adopt to treat distilleri spent wash as report in the literatur
in the same way it analys the usag of differ type of coagul such as natur electro and chemic coagul use in distilleri spent wash treatment
to the next of the coagul analysi it check out the perform review of entir contribut on distilleri spent wash treatment
the convent process for distilleri spent wash treatment have limit such as limit remov effici high oper cost and mainten also it need a high detent time that eventu increas the on the whole treatment process time
the aforesaid limit can be overcom by adopt soft comput techniqu
soft comput has been wide studi and appli in the past three decad for engin and scientif research comput
in environment engin engin and research have effect use various techniqu of soft comput like fuzzi logic artifici neural network adapt neuro-fuzzi infer system and support vector machin which can be use for the research to achiev further research on distilleri spent wash treatment .
