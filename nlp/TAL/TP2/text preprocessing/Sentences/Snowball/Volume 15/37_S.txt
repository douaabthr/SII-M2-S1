nich comprehens learn gravit search algorithm for multimod optim problem
mani nich algorithm have been propos in recent time to cater complex real-world problem have sever global/loc optima
these algorithm help in locat as mani global/loc optima as possibl
howev to explor the search space along with locat and maintain a larg number of global solut is alway a challeng problem
henc we propos a new nich strategi name nich comprehens learn gravit search algorithm in which the clgsa algorithm is use to solv complex problem have multipl solut
the propos algorithm first effici tri to explor the search space without trap in local optima s and second it locat all possibl global optima s
this algorithm has an extern memori that enhanc it capabl to find the maximum number of optima s
the propos approach is test on the ieee cec-2013 multimod optim benchmark problem li et al
in evolutionari comput and machin learn group rmit univers melbourn australia technic report 2013
the result of the propos scheme are compar with five other state-of-the-art method
in order to show the effici of clgsa algorithm over real-lif multimod optim problem it appli to non-linear and a mix variabl problem this is the reactiv power dispatch problem rpd
a standard benchmark ieee-57 bus system is consid to evalu the effici of the clgsa
the evalu simul result show that clgsa algorithm success solv multimod problem and the rpd problem with signific accuraci .
