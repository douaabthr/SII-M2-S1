distribut optim dispatch of integr electr and natur gas system consid the pipelin storag characterist
as an import form of multi-energi complement the integr electr and natur gas system ieg is a new carrier for renew energi accommod
first base on the natur gas pipelin model the buffer effect of natur gas pipelin storag characterist in respons to natur gas load fluctuat is analyz
then consid the pipelin storag characterist a dad-ahead econom dispatch model for iegss with a high proport of wind power is establish
and the extrem scenario optim method is use in this model to deal with the uncertainti of wind power
furthermor a distribut solut method base on the improv altern direct method of multipli is propos to acceler the converg of distribut solut
case studi are conduct on a modifi ieee 39 bus system and a belgium 20 node natur gas system to verifi the effect of model and algorithm .
