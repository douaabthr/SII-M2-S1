a new differenti evolut algorithm for cooper fuzzi rule mine applic to anomali detect
fuzzi classif rule mine can be consid as a challeng optim problem with the purpos of extract accur and interpret rule
this paper deal with a michigan cooper approach for mine fuzzi rule
the propos algorithm name ede-frmin use an enhanc differenti evolut that evolv popul of individu each one repres a singl rule
the whole popul collabor to generat in one shot an accur and reduc number of rule
ede-frmin is an intellig process of evolut that use fast arithmet oper and a new cooper weight memori
this latter allow share inform between individu
in addit it use a new threshold base fit function use a redefin support and confid measur
the adapt threshold mechan use in the fit function aim to adapt the miner system to problem with dynam train data
experi are carri out use the nsl-kdd 99 intrus detect data set and other data set from the uci repositori
a compar studi with other competit evolutionari rule base system is perform and the result show the effect of propos algorithm .
