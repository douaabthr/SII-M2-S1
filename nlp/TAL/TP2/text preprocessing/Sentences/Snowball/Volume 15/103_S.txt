a new improv salp swarm algorithm use logarithm spiral mechan enhanc with chao for global optim
recent salp swarm algorithm ssa has emerg as a new population-bas meta-heurist techniqu in the area of optim
it is main inspir from the navig and forag behaviour of salp swarm
the aforement algorithm weak is stagnat in local optima and low converg rate
to overcom these drawback we propos a new improv spiral chaotic salp swarm algorithm call isc-ssa
compar with origin ssa isc-ssa includ logarithm spiral mechan incorpor with chaotic search method capabl to enhanc further it perform
the function of isc-ssa algorithm is first test on 20 unimod multimod and composit mathemat optim problem with ten differ chaotic map to select the most appropri one for isc-ssa modif
then the algorithm is appli to solv sever engin optim problem
the compar experiment result with competit metaheurist algorithm reveal that isc-ssa algorithm can generat the best solut .
