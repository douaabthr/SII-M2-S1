video super-resolut use hybrid support vector regress actor critic neural network model
the aim of video super-resolut sr is to produc a high-resolut hr video frame from numer success low-resolut lr frame
even though there are a larg number of techniqu employ for the video sr all these exist techniqu face a hectic challeng at various condit
thus this paper propos an effect video resolut strategi use the hybrid support vector regress actor critic neural network svr acnn model for video enhanc
the sr imag form use the individu svr model and acnn are integr use the weight averag concept
the acnn is tune optim by the propos fractional-bas sine cosin algorithm f-sca which is respons for the global optim converg
the experiment of the propos method util three video taken from the cambridge-driv label video databas camvid and the result are analyz for three scale factor
the result prove that the propos model offer a better sr imag with a better psnr ssim and sdme of 33.6447 db 0.9398 and 45.2779 respect .
