the hybrid of aco ga and rvns algorithm for solv the time-depend travel salesman problem
the time-depend travel salesman problem is a class of combinatori optim problem
natur metaheurist is a suitabl approach to solv the problem with larg size in short comput time
previous sever metaheurist have been propos for solv the problem
these algorithm might have a strong search intensif and their diversif mechan may not be suffici
due to the random natur population-bas algorithm improv on the chanc of find a global
in this paper we propos a population-bas algorithm that combin an ant coloni algorithm aco genet algorithm ga and neighborhood descent with random neighborhood order rvnd
in the algorithm the aco and ga are use to explor the promis solut area that are yet to refin while the rvnd exploit them with the hope of improv a solut
therefor our metaheurist algorithm balanc between explor and exploit
extens numer experi and comparison with the state-of-the-art metaheurist algorithm in the literatur show that the propos algorithm reach better solut in mani case .
