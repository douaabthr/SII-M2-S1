predict of rock mass rate use neural network with an improv rider optim algorithm
evalu of tbm perform is critic for the choic of tbm specif and tunnel design
in the past decad the hypothet scheme depend on the rock fragment process and the experiment model up to field surveil as well as machin perform are the two main method
tradit and convent approach for rock mass rate rmr predict usual consid excess paramet and the accuraci are far from actual valu
a new rmr predict model base on the optim neural network nn is design
to improv the predict accuraci this paper propos a new self-adapt rider optim algorithm sa-roa which appli optim logic to train the nn by updat the weight as wave veloc vp transvers wave veloc vs vp/vs statist stat orient magnitud polar wave type and metr
final the rmr predict analysi of the adopt nn-sa-roa model is compar to the convent and tradit classifi with vari learn percentag 50% 60% 70% and 80% for three data set respect
subsequ the perform of the propos work is verifi use other approach base on error analysi
the predict mean absolut error mae and the mean absolut percentag error mape of sa-roa are smaller than convent and tradit scheme
the result show that the propos method can success predict the actual rmr .
