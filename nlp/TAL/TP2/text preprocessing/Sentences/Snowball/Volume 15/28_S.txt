applic of grey wolf optim algorithm for load frequenc control in multi-sourc singl area power system
in this paper applic of evolutionari intelligence-bas grey wolf optim gwo algorithm has been present to estim the optim paramet of proportional-integral-deriv pid control for load frequenc control lfc in multi-sourc singl area power network
the multi-sourc singl area power network which is consid here is compris of reheat turbin thermal power plant gas power plant and hydro power plant with the mechan hydraul governor
in this paper the paramet of pid control for lfc of under studi system are optim use gwo algorithm by consid four import perform indic instead of consid one or two name integr of time-weight squar error its integr of time-weight absolut error ita integr of squar error ise and integr of absolut error iae
the implement techniqu has been compar with genet algorithm ga techniqu for 1% 2% and 5% load disturb to show the effect and applic for lfc in multi-sourc singl area power network .
