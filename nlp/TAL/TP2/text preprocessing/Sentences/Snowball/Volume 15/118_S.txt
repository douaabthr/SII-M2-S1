higher order ann paramet optim use hybrid opposition-elit base metaheurist
for two decad the domin of nature-inspir optim algorithm has been irresist in solv mani complex problem
in fact most of these algorithm are integr with some other intellig techniqu to prove the effect of each method
out of these algorithm the last decad has wit a good research contribut for teach learn base optim and it differ variat as well as advanc in mani engin domain
in this research a variat of the tlbo techniqu has been integr with the function link artifici neural network to classifi the nonlinear data
with suitabl paramet adjust the propos model can classifi the data effici
for learn the gradient descent method has been adopt for obtain the optim weight unit of the neural network
simul result reveal that the propos hybrid approach is superior in term of consid perform paramet as compar to other competit method .
