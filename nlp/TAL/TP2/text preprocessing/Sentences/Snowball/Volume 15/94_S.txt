comparison of various electr market price strategi to reduc generat cost of a microgrid system use hybrid woa-sca
this paper aim to minim the generat cost of a low voltag lv grid-connect microgrid system use a novel hybrid whale optim algorithm woa sine cosin algorithm sca optim techniqu
three differ method of electr market price are formul in turn and the generat cost is evalu for each method to sort out the best among them which yield the least generat cost of the same microgrid system
both activ and passiv particip of grid are studi to acknowledg it import
numer result show that the time of usag tou method of electr market price prove to be the most conveni and econom method for cost analysi of the system
the generat cost was at it maximum when the electr price was a constant valu
also dure the tou method of electr price a 15% surg in the price was realiz when the grid was passiv particip in suppli power to the system
figur and statist data aid the fact that propos hybrid woasca outperform woa in consist provid a robust and superior qualiti result .
