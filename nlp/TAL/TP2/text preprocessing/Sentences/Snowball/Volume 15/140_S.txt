lung diseas identif method base on capsul neural network
in the automat identif of lesion aim at the misdiagnosi of the lung nodul size shape blood vessel and other lung tissu on ct imag of pneumonia this paper propos a method for identifi lung diseas base on capsul neural network
consid that the textur featur of lung ct imag contain import medic inform this articl first combin gray averag entropi fractal dimens and fractal intercept to form featur vector as textur featur and introduc context model to obtain context inform
the lbg algorithm was use to achiev context quantize and the ct imag of lung were preprocess
then for the problem of less ct imag data of lung and fewer featur of lung diseas in this paper the exist imag are enhanc and the data set is expand
final in the recognit process of pneumonia the characterist pose inform will affect the recognit
in order to solv this problem this paper use a capsul neural network to identifi and detect lung ct imag
the applic result show that the accuraci rate of identifi lung diseas by capsul neural network is 98.7%
compar with tradit convolut network capsul neural network can better identifi lung diseas .
