cluster method and sine cosin algorithm for imag segment
this articl present a new imag segment approach base on the principl of cluster optim by the meta-heurist algorithm name sca algorithm sinus cosin
this algorithm use a mathemat model base on trigonometr function to solv optim problem
such an approach was develop to solv the drawback exist in classic cluster techniqu such as the initi of cluster center and converg toward the local optimum
in fact to obtain an optim cluster center and to improv the imag segment qualiti we propos this techniqu which begin with the generat of a random popul
then we determin the number of cluster to exploit
later we formul an object function to maxim the interclass distanc and minim the intra-class distanc
the resolut of this function give the best overal solut use to updat the rest of the popul
the perform of the propos approach are evalu use a set of refer imag and compar to sever classic cluster method like k-mean or fuzzi c-mean and other meta-heurist approach such as genet algorithm and particl swarm optim
the result obtain from the differ method are analyz base on the best fit valu psnr rmse sc xb pc s sc ce and the comput time
the experiment result show that the propos approach give satisfactori result compar to the other method .
