to provid effect resolut for complex real-lif problem and other optim problem abund various procedur have been present in the last few decad
this paper propos a simpl but effici hybrid evolutionari algorithm call goa-d for solv visual track problem
in the propos hybrid algorithm grasshopp optim algorithm goa oper in refin the vector
in contrast the differenti evolut de algorithm is use for transform the decis vector base on genet oper
the improv in maintain the balanc between explor and exploit abil is made by incorpor genet oper name mutat and crossov in goa
the success of goa-d is estim by 23 classic benchmark function cec05 function and cec 2014 function
the goa-d algorithm result prove that it is veri viabl associ with the metaheurist up-to-d procedur
similar visual track problem are resolv by the goa-d algorithm as a real challeng case studi
