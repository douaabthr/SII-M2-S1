a compar analysi of meta-heurist optim algorithm for featur select and featur weight in neural network
featur select and featur weight are frequent use in machin learn for process high dimension data
it reduc the number of featur in the dataset and make the classif process easier
meta-heurist algorithm are wide adopt for featur select and featur weight due to their enhanc search abil
this paper compar five differ meta-heurist optim algorithm that are recent introduc for featur select and featur weight in artifici neural network
this includ chimp optim algorithm tunic swarm algorithm bear smell search algorithm antlion optim algorithm and modifi antlion optim algorithm
experiment evalu are perform on five differ dataset to illustr the signific improv observ dure classif process of all the algorithm utilis in the compar analysi
both tunic swarm algorithm and chimp optim algorithm has gain better classif accuraci than other algorithm
howev all these algorithm are found to be more effect for featur select and featur weight process .
