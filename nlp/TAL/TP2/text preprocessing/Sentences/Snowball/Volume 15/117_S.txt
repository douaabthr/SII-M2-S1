optimum-path forest stacking-bas ensembl for intrus detect
machin learn techniqu have been extens research in the last year main due to their effect when deal with recognit or classif applic
typic one can comprehend use a machin learn system to autonom deleg routin save human effort and produc great insight regard decision-mak task
this paper introduc and valid a stacking-bas ensembl approach use optimum-path forest classifi in intrus detect task
instead of onli use the famous nsl-kdd dataset we propos a new dataset call unespi which we believ will fill the gap concern new intrus detect dataset
both dataset were evalu under sever classifi includ logist regress decis tree support vector machin optimum-path forest and compar against optimum-path forest stacking-bas ensembl
experiment result show an optimum-path forest stacking-bas ensembl classif suitabl particular when consid it abil to general larg volum of data while sustain it perform .
