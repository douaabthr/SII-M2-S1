sparse-fcm and deep learn for effect classif of land area in multi-spectr satellit imag
remot sens play a major role in crop classif land use classif and land cover classif such that the inform for the classif is assur with the help of the satellit imag
this paper concentr on the land use classif and propos an optim algorithm call firefli harmoni search fhs for train the deep belief neural network dbn
the fhs algorithm is the integr of the firefli algorithm and harmoni search algorithm hsa which tune the weight of dbn to perform the multi-class classif
for the effect classif the multispectr imag is subject to the spars fuzzi c-mean to form segment such that the featur extract is effect free from dimension issu and comput complex
the featur extract from the segment of the multi-spectr imag includ veget indic and statist featur
then these featur are fed to the dbn which is tune use the fhs algorithm for perform the land use classif
experiment use four dataset prove the effect of the propos multi-class classif approach
the accuraci sensit and specif of the method are found to be 0.9317 0.9568 and 0.0379 respect that is effect over the exist land use classif method .
