cuddl death algorithm use abc for detect unhealthi node in wireless sensor network
wireless sensor network consist of some sensor node that have a minimum oper capabl with less memori capac for store data and limit energi sourc
the deploy of these node or sensor take place random in a dynam or static environ
this type of placement of node in a hostil environ can be charg by the malici node in a wireless sensor network wsn
this vulner in node make the wireless sensor network unstabl and lead to mani type of demerit like limit batteri lifetim less comput and limit memori space
to avoid these attack and to reduc the impact creat by the malici node we suggest a simpl and effect way of detect and remov unhealthi node in the environ
we propos a simpl scheme by use the artifici bee coloni algorithm which is known as the cuddl death design
the theme of a scheme is to find the unhealthi or malici cluster head node in the network and remov that particular node without creat ani harm to the other node in the environ
it also help to improv the energi effici packet deliveri ratio with maximum throughput in wsn .
