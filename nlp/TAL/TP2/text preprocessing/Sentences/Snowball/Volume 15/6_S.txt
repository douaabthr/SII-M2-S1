real-tim applic of swarm and evolutionari algorithm for line follow autom guid vehicl a comprehens studi
one of the most econom form of autom guid vehicl agv is a vision-bas line follow
a line follow use machin vision to extract the path shape from the captur imag and follow it
among mani method for path detect some studi suggest use the real-tim applic of meta-heurist population-bas algorithm for visual line follow agv
general swarm intellig and evolutionari algorithm are not well suit for real-tim applic as they need generat to evolv
for this reason a comprehens studi is present to find the best solut to this particular applic
artifici bee coloni genet algorithm harmoni search imperialist competit algorithm and particl swarm optim were studi with three propos object function that could assist path shape detect
the fastest and most reliabl solut is optim and test on a real agv platform
the agv design for this research has an independ onboard raspberri pi 3 with an arm processor and it is capabl of travers the track fast and reliabl
furthermor the propos system doe not requir edg detect or down-sampl on captur imag
addit our newli develop direct infer techniqu the triangl closest midpoint enabl the agv to find it path even with faulti or incomplet input
as a result a novel real-tim meta-heurist line follow agv is present in this research .
