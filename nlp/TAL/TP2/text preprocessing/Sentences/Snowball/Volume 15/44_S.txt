support vector regress and extend nearest neighbor for video object retriev
video retriev is one of the emerg area in video captur that gain various technic advanc increas the avail of a huge mass of video
for the text or the imag queri given retriev the relev video and the object from the video is not alway an easi task
a hybrid model was develop in the previous work use the nearest search algorithm nsa and exponenti weight move averag ewma for the video object retriev
in nsa ewma the object trajectori are retriev base on the queri specif distanc
this work extend the previous work by develop a novel path equal scheme for equal the path length of the queri and the track object
initi a hybrid model base on support vector regress and nsa track the posit of the object in the video
the propos densiti measur scheme equal the path length of the queri and the object
then the identifi path length relat to the queri is given to extend nearest neighbor classifi for retriev the video
from the simul result it is evid that the propos video retriev scheme achiev high valu of 0.901 0.860 0.849 and 0.922 for precis recal f-measur and multipl object track precis respect .
