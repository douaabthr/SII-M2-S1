classifi four imagin object with eeg signal
eeg signal contain inform direct relat to cognit activ
this paper present a method to classifi the imag a person imagin via the inform provid by the eeg signal
the imag relat to the object tree hous plane and dog have been reconstruct
we have use a convolut neural network to obtain the reconstruct of the imag and a genet algorithm to find the paramet of this network
the result obtain have been evalu by mean of a chebychev metric to compar the imag and it show that the reconstruct is perform with a success of 57% over chanc with an accuraci in the classif of 60% and a kappa valu of 0.40 demonstr that the classif of five mental state where four of them come from the visual imageri is possibl .
