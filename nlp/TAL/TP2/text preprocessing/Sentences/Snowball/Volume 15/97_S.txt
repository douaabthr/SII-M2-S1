balanc broad and deep search in evolutionari comput via a parallel zone search
comput time and solut precis are two major concern in evolutionari comput ec
although high-perform comput techniqu have been appli to reduc the comput time of meta-heurist algorithm it doe not mean that they can assist meta-heurist algorithm in find a high-qual solut
moreov most of meta-heurist algorithm may belong to the depth-first search method thus achiev a tradeoff between the broad search and the deep search is a crucial object in the ec
to allevi the abov problem a parallel zone search pzs strategi is propos in the current studi
in the pzs the entir search space is divid into mani small search space for improv the broad search capabl of algorithm and reduc the problem complex
subsequ select meta-heurist algorithm consid as deep search algorithm are employ to find a satisfactori solut in each search region
the effect of the pzs integr into six differenti evolut de variant is demonstr on two common use test suit i.e. ieee cec2014 and bbob2012
result suggest that the pzs is a high competit approach to solv differ type of optim problem especi on complex optim problem
final the pzs incorpor into six de variant is use to estim paramet of a heavi oil thermal crack model
result indic that the pzs is an effect and effici tool to help select algorithm solv actual industri optim problem .
