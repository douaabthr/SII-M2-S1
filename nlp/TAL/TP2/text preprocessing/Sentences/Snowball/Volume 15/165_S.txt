seek a balanc between popul divers and prematur converg for real-cod genet algorithm with crossov oper
the major issu for optim with genet algorithm gas is get stuck on a local optimum or a low comput effici
in this research we propos a new real-cod base crossov oper by use the exponenti pareto distribut epx which aim to preserv the two extrem
we use epx with three the most reput mutat oper makinen periaux and toivanen mutat mptm non uniform mutat num and power mutat pm
the experiment result with eighteen well-known model depict that our propos epx oper perform better than the other competit crossov oper
the comparison analysi is evalu through mean standard deviat and the perform index
signific of epx vs competit is examin by perform the two-tail t-test
henc the new crossov scheme appear to be signific as well as compar to establish the cross among parent for better offspr .
