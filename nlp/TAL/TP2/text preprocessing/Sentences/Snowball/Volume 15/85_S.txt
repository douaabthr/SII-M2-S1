fusion model base on entropi by use optim dcnn and iter seed for multilan detect
the recent progress in the dsas led to the progress of advanc lane detect system for prevent accid
the inform about the lane is detect which is use for the vehicl control and provid warn to the driver
this paper propos the multi-lan detect base on an entropy-bas fusion approach
the main use of the propos model for combin the result obtain by the ew-csa base dcnn and iter seed base on region for provid effici multilan detect
initi the lane are detect use a deep learn techniqu that is train use an optim algorithm ew-csa
similar the approach name segment base on region is use for the detect of multi-lan
depend on the result of the two approach an fusion model base on entropi is propos for make the best result base on a pre-defin threshold
the propos method perform is evalu base on the metric such as specif accuraci and sensit which outperform with valu 0.887 0.991 and 0.992 respect .
