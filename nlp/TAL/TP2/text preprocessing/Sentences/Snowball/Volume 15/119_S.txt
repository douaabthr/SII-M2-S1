a new artifici bee coloni algorithm use a gradual weight method for the bi-object travel salesman problem
the travel salesman problem tsp is a typic problem in combinatori optim
the uniqu object of the tradit tsp is to minim the tour distanc
when more than one object is taken into account to be optim simultan the problem is known as a multi-object tsp
in the present paper a bi-object travel salesman problem botsp is consid where both the cost and the distanc are taken as optim object
we introduc a new algorithm that solv the botsp call gw-abc
this algorithm is base on an artifici bee coloni algorithm abc and use a gradual weight generat method
first we appli a gradual method to prepar the weight vector
in fact weight vector valu are gradual distribut in the object space and chang relat to the optim process from cycl to anoth
second we appli the abc algorithm with the generat weight to our problem
the propos algorithm is experiment test on well-known benchmark instanc of differ size and compar with other state-of-the-art algorithm
the obtain experiment result show that gw-abc is signific better .
