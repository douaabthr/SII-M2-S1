local transform direct pattern and optim driven dbn for age estim
age estim is an interest and challeng research area gain signific import in the recent era and is employ in various applic such as intellig surveil face recognit biometr and so on
various techniqu are employ in the literatur for age estim from the face imag
this paper introduc the age estim scheme from the face imag and estim is done by defin a novel featur extract strategi name local transform direct pattern ltdp
the databas contain the input imag has mani unwant region and thus the viola jone algorithm detect the requir face region
after detect the face region activ appear model extract the activ appear featur and the propos ltdp extract the textur featur
the propos ltdp featur extract model modifi the exist local direct pattern ldp with sever other textur featur extract model
after the featur extract the cuckoo search base deep belief network cdbn classifi estim the age of the person from the face imag base on the extract featur
the simul result reveal that the propos ltdp with the cdbn classifi achiev high perform with the valu of 2.3416 0.9803 and 0.9724 for mae aeo and aem respect .
