dynam crow search algorithm base on adapt paramet for large-scal global optim
despit the good perform of crow search algorithm csa in deal with global optim problem unfortun it is not the case with respect to the converg perform
convent csa explor and exploit are strong depend on the proper set of awar probabl ap and flight length fl paramet
in each optim problem ap and fl paramet are set in an ad hoc manner and their valu do not chang over the optim process
to this date there is no analyt approach to adjust their best valu
this present a major drawback to appli csa in complex practic problem
henc the convent csa is use onli for limit problem due to fact that csa with fix ap and fl is frequent trap into local optimum
in this present paper an enhanc version of csa call dynam crow search algorithm dcsa is propos to overcom the drawback of the convent csa
in the propos dcsa two modif of the basic algorithm are made
the first modif concern the continu adjust of the csa paramet lead to a dcsa where ap will be adjust linear over optim process and fl will be adjust accord to the general pareto probabl densiti function
this dynam adjust will provid more global search capabl as well as more exploit of the pre-fin solut
the second modif concern the improv of csa s swarm divers in the search process
this will lead to a high converg accuraci and fast converg rate
the effect of the propos algorithm is valid use a set of experiment seri use 13 complex benchmark function
experiment result high prove the modifi algorithm effect compar to the basic algorithm in term of converg rate global search capabl and final solut
in addit a comparison with convent and recent similar algorithm reveal that dcsa give superior result in term of perform and effici .
