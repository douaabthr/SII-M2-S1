bitcoin close price movement predict with optim function link neural network
bitcoin predict is a recent area of research interest and grow fast
sinc it incept in a short period of time bitcoin got wide popular and consid as an invest asset
at present it is the most success cryptocurr compar to other altcoin dispers in the world economi
the bitcoin price fluctuat like other stock market due to inher volatil
the investor confid on bitcoin rise fast and have been reflect on it price
though few comput intellig method are avail sophist methodolog for accur predict of bitcoin are still lack and need to be explor
function link neural network fln is a flat network offer lower comput complex and achiev enhanc input output nonlinear map through function expans of input signal
basi function such as legendr trigonometr laguerr and chebyshev are common use polynomi in fln for expans of input signal dimens
in this articl along with the weight and bias vector of flns optim number of polynomi function for each categori of basi function is select by genet algorithm dure train process rather fix them earlier
therefor an optim fln structur is craft on fli from exploit of train data
the optim fln model are use to predict the daili week and month close price of bitcoin
a compar studi among optim flns is carri out use evalu metric such as mape nmse arv and u of theil s statist
final outcom from experiment and compar studi suggest the superior of optim fln model for bitcoin close price predict .
