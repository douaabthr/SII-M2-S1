a kriging-bas multi-point sequenti sampl optim method for complex black-box problem
the general effici global optim gego algorithm assist by krige model can solv black-box problem of complex comput
howev a singl sampl point obtain in each iter process may caus longer objective-evalu time and slower converg speed in contrast with multi-point sampl optim method
for this a kriging-bas multi-point sequenti sampl optim kmsso method is present
the propos method use uncertainti estim inform of krige to construct the multiple-point general expect improv ei criterion
in optim cycl this criterion is maxim to produc the pareto front data which will be further screen to obtain final expens evalu point
for numer test and an engin case kmsso is compar to gego and ham algorithm and is shown to deliv better result
it is also prove that when multipl point are ad per cycl the optim accuraci and converg properti are both improv .
