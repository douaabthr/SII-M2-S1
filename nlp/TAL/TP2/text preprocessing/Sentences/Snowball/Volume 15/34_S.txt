a compar approach to multiobject optim of aisc thin-wal member
optim of structur member such as beam and column has receiv increas interest with advanc in comput manufactur and artifici intellig
design pursu multiobject optim are typic interest in minim the cost of the member while maxim some perform metric relat to load bear capabl or stress
in this studi thin-wal member list in aisc tabl were optim in a similar manner use genet algorithm
the influenc of sever object was consid and emphasi was place on provid the custom with a divers choic of solut
to demonstr the approach wide-flang i-beam and circular pipe cross-sect were examin
multi-dimension pareto-front were obtain
optim cross-sect were compar to aisc beam tabl
multi-criteria decision-mak techniqu were use to select a prefer solut from a pareto-front
for i-beam improv of 3 7% over tabl were obtain and for pipe it was 47 76%
final the perform of two common use genet algorithm nsga-ii and spea-ii was compar use pareto-front metric
while spea-ii produc sever nondomin solut nsga-ii was shown to produc the overal superior front consid metric present from the literatur .
