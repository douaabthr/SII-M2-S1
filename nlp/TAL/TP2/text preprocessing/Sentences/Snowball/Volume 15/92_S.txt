precis recal curv prc classif tree
the classif of imbalanc data has present a signific challeng for most well-known classif algorithm that were often design for data with relat balanc class distribut
nevertheless skew class distribut is a common featur in real world problem
it is especi preval in certain applic domain with great need for machin learn and better predict analysi such as diseas diagnosi fraud detect bankruptci predict and suspect identif
in this paper we propos a novel tree-bas algorithm base on the area under the precis recal curv for variabl select in the classif context
our algorithm name as the precis recal curv classif tree or simpli the prc classif tree modifi two crucial stage in tree build
the first stage is to maxim the area under the precis recal curv in node variabl select
the second stage is to maxim the harmon mean of recal and precis f-measur for threshold select
we found the propos prc classif tree and it subsequ extens the prc random forest work well especi for class-imbalanc data set
we have demonstr that our method outperform their classic counterpart the usual cart and random forest for both synthet and real data
furthermor the roc classif tree propos by our group previous base on the area under the roc curv has shown good perform in imbalanc data
their combin the prc roc tree has also show great promis in identifi the minor class .
