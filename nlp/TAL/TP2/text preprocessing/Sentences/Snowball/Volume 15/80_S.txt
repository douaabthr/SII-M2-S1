gaussian hybrid fuzzi cluster and radial basi neural network for automat brain tumor classif in mri imag
magnet reson imag mri is an emerg research area employ extens in radiolog for the diagnosi of various neurolog diseas
here as the classif of mri gain signific import for the tumor diagnosi various techniqu are develop in the literatur for the automat classif of mri imag
in this paper a cluster scheme name gaussian hybrid fuzzi cluster ghfc is develop by hybrid the fuzzi c-mean fcm cluster and spars fcm along with the gaussian function for the segment purpos
after segment the imag the suitabl featur are extract from the imag and given to the exponenti cuckoo base radial basi neural network exponenti cuckoo base rbnn classifi
the featur serv as the train inform for the exponenti cuckoo base rbnn classifi and it final detect the train class
simul of the propos work is done use brat and simbrat databas and the result are compar with sever state-of-art techniqu
simul result depict that the propos ghfc along with the rbnn classifi achiev improv accuraci and mean squar error result with the valu of 0.8952 and 0.0074 respect for the brat dataset and 0.8719 and 0.0036 for the simbrat dataset .
