a polynomi time algorithm for big data in a special case of minimum constraint remov problem
the minimum constraint remov mcr is one of the most import problem in motion plan and comput geometri
in this problem there is no feasibl path for a robot to move from the start point toward the goal
therefor in order to find a collision-fre path the minimum constraint should be remov
themcrproblem is np-hard when constraint have arbitrari shape or are in shape of convex polygon
sinc it is not possibl to solv the problem by determinist algorithm in an accept time for the problem with big data scientist have tri to solv it by approxim method
in this paper we present a determinist not approxim algorithm that solv the problem in a polynomi time
the simplif we use here is about the type of data neither about the accuraci of the solut nor about the size of data set
in this paper a special case of this problem is present in which all the constraint are axis-aligned-unit squar and the obstacl have onli local effect
local effect mean there are no two cell which have the same label set
we propos an algorithm for this variant of the problem which can be use for big data
the propos algorithm has o n 3 time complex in the worst case .
