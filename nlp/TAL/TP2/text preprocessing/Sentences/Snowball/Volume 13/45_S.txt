sensor placement optim and damag identif in a fuselag structur use invers modal problem and firefli algorithm
the structur monitor of mechan system is an extrem import task for ensur it perform and structur health
to overcom limit of tradit non-destruct inspect ndis damag identif techniqu have been develop from global indic main those base on modal data
in this studi damag are identifi by solv an invers problem
a fuselag model of an e190 aircraft is consid and the firefli algorithm fa metaheurist is appli to solv the invers problem in order to identifi structur damag locat and sever
the method is then solv in two main front 1 the direct problem use finit element analysi and 2 the invers problem by minim an object function
evalu modal respons at mani point on a large-scal structur can becom prohibit
for this a method of optim sensor is perform use the fisher inform matrix fim
result are compar consid the sensor placement optim problem
it is notic that optim sensor contribut to an improv in the identif of damag main for complex and large-scal structur
the propos optim damag identif process use fim-fa has the potenti to be extend to a wide rang of shm applic in complex structur
henc tradit ndis have mani shortcom due to the complex of large-scal structur as well as modern design structur and may not be practic if the structur has restrict access
accord an enhanc damag identif method is develop in order to better handl measur data to find structur chang or damag in complex aerospac structur .
