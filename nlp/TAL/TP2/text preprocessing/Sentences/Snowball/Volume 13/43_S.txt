difficult first strategi gp an inexpens sampl techniqu to improv the perform of genet program
genet program gp is a top perform in solv classif and cluster problem in general and symbol regress problem in particular
gp has produc impress result and has outperform human generat result for 76 differ problem taken from 22 differ field
there remain a number of signific open issu despit it impress result
among them are high comput cost prematur converg and high error rate
these issu must be address for gp to realis it full potenti
in this paper a simpl and cost effect techniqu call difficult first strategy-gp dfs-gp is propos to address the aforement problem
the propos techniqu involv pre-process and sampl step
in the pre-process step difficultto evolv data point by gp from the given data set are mark and in the sampl step they are introduc in the evolutionari run by use two newli defin sampl techniqu call difficult point first and difficulti proportion select
these techniqu are bias toward select difficult data point dure the initi stage of a run and of easi point in the latter stage of a run
this ensur that gp doe not ignor difficult-to-evolv data point dure a run
experi have shown that gp coupl with dfs avoid prematur converg and attain higher fit than standard gp use same fit evalu
perform of the propos techniqu was evalu on three common known metric which are converg speed fit and varianc in the best result
our result have shown that the propos setup had achiev 10 15% better fit valu than standard gp
furthermor the propos setup had consist generat better qualiti solut on all the problem and util 30 50% less comput to match the best perform of standard gp .
