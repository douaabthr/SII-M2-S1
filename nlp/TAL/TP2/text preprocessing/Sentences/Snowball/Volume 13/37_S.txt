an evalu of ear biometr system base on enhanc jaya algorithm and surf descriptor
recent the ear biometr has receiv much attent for human recognit due to it uniqu shape and rich local featur
howev extract discrimin featur from ear imag is a crucial task in presenc of illumin chang low contrast nois and pose variat
with the aim of neutral the effect of these factor this paper propos an automat enhanc techniqu use meta-heurist optim to enhanc the ear imag
here we modifi a recent and simpl yet meta-heurist optim techniqu known as jaya algorithm by introduc a mutat oper to enhanc the ear imag in few iter and the propos approach is name as enhanc jaya algorithm
then we employ a pose-invari local featur extractor surf to extract local featur
final thek-nnclassifi has use to evalu the rate of correct identif
extens experi are conduct on four standard dataset and the perform evalu is carri out by qualit and quantit measur
experiment result clear indic the propos enhanc approach is competit as compar to two classic method he clahe and two meta-heurist algorithm pso and de-bas imag enhanc techniqu .
