a parallel classif framework for protein fold recognit
protein tertiari structur which is determin by it amino acid sequenc via the protein fold process have essenti role in the function of protein
protein fold recognit is one of the interest studi in bioinformat
in this paper to address this issu we propos a featur select fs method base on map_reduc framework and vortex search algorithm vsa
fs is one of the most import step of pre-process data which aim to select a variabl subset of relev featur
in unparallel mode and typic data over hundr of featur select and dimens reduct algorithm have been provid such as principl compon analysi linear discrimin analysi and so on
nevertheless these algorithm are not implement for real-world applic when data instanc increas in three-dimension volum veloc and varieti that call big data actual if we want to use previous featur select method on big data volum of larg and complex comput will be requir
vsa was inspir from the vortex pattern creat by the vortic flow of the stir fluid
in map_reduc framework map and reduc function execut in parallel mode
in the propos method in each step of map function a vsa is employ to find an optim subset of featur and decreas featur search space
in the light of the abov consider we evalu the propos method in classif of a benchmark dataset for protein fold recognit
the experiment result indic that the propos method improv predict accuraci consider .
