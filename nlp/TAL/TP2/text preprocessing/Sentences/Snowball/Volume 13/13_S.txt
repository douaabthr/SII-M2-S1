implement of adapt scheme in evolutionari techniqu for anomaly-bas intrus detect
intrus detect has becom import to network secur becaus of the increas connect between comput and internet
various intrus detect system have been investig to protect web or network use sever evolutionari method and classif techniqu
in this studi we propos a new techniqu by combin ensembl of featur select ef and adapt grasshopp optim algorithm agoa method call efsagoa which can help to identifi the type of attack
in the propos approach initi ef method is appli to rank the attribut for select the high rank subset of attribut
then agoa is employ to determin import attribut from the reduc dataset that can contribut to predict the network traffic behavior
furthermor adapt behavior of goa use to decid whether a record repres an anomali or not differ from some approach acquaint in the literatur
agoa use the support vector machin svm as a fit function to choos the extrem effici featur and to maxim the classif perform
in addit it is also appli to optim the penalti factor c kernel paramet sigma and tube size epsilon of svm classifi
the perform of efsagoa has been evalu on modern intrus data as iscx 2012
the experiment result demonstr that the propos method perform better and obtain high detect rate accuraci and low fals alarm rate compar to other state-of-art techniqu in iscx 2012 data .
