step away from maxim of concav quadrat in random line search
random line rl search reli on find a minim of a given cost function along random select line in the function domain
onc three point along each line are identifi a quadrat function pass through these point is determin and the minimum of the function is use whenev the function is convex
this paper propos a two-step approach for handl concav case 1 start from a point with the smallest function valu and then 2 step in the direct away from the maxim of the quadrat function
promis numer result compar the improv rl method with other similar evolutionari method are present .
