discoveri of redund free maximum disjoint set-k-cov for wsn life enhanc with evolutionari ensembl architectur
in the wireless sensor network lifetim enhanc of network is a critic design issu for a wide number of applic
along with ultra-low power technolog the comput approach in the develop of sever disjoint cover of sensor such that each cover must provid the coverag of all target can be a more effect mean for increas the life span of the network
this enforc to maxim the number of possibl disjoint cover among avail sensor in the network
effect this problem can be treat as a set-k-cov problem which has been proven to be np-complet
to make the solut more power-effici in this paper the complex of the problem has increas at a further level by expect not onli the upper bound of cover but also make the cover redund free and form with the minim number of sensor
this problem can be consid as a search of multipl compon where each compon itself carri a multi-dimension characterist
in a natur system where evolut is the fundament principl in the develop of ani entiti such kind of multi-compon complex problem doesn t handl at one stage
first an integr approxim solut evolv and later each compon evolv separ
this is the reason that for the set-k-cov problem singl stage of the various success evolutionari algorithm have shown their limit in achiev the upper bound of cover and in deliv redund free solut
in the past some kind of sequenti local scan process has been integr with evolutionari comput in the iter for each cover to improv the perform
but discov cover fail to meet object of upper bound and/or redund free cover with the minim number of sensor
henc this research has explor the possibl of find the solut through more closer to natur way i. e
onli through evolut onli without local scan process
to meet the desir object in this paper an ensembl evolutionari concept has propos which has deliv redund free the upper bound of cover with the minimum number of sensor
evolutionari ensembl architectur work at a differ level in a cascad manner to maxim the total possibl number of disjoint cover and their refin along with that there is a feedback mechan to explor the new cover further if there is ani
base on the natur extinct process an extinct oper has also introduc in the genet algorithm to increas the converg rate and better explor
instead of fitness-ori equal opportun for everi parent in offspr creation was introduc to increas the divers level
the perform result on differ simul network confirm that without fail the propos solut has achiev all object wherea various variant of differenti evolut and genet algorithm and particl swarm optim fail to deliv desir perform .
