improv mani object optimis algorithm use object dimension reduct
many-object optimis problem maop have recent receiv a consider attent from research
due to the larg number of object maop bring serious difficulti to exist multi-object evolutionari algorithm moea
the major difficulti includ the poor scalabl the high comput cost and the difficulti in visualis
a number of many-object evolutionari algorithm maoea has been propos to tackl maop but exist maoea have still face with the difficulti when the number of object increas
real-world maop often have redund object that are not onli inessenti to describ the pareto-optim front but also deterior maoea
a common approach to the problem is to use object dimension reduct algorithm to elimin redund object
by remov redund object object reduct algorithm can improv the search effici reduc comput cost and support for decis make
the perform of an object dimension reduct strong depend on nondomin solut generat by moeas/maoea
the impact of object reduct algorithm on moea and vice versa have been wide investig
howev the impact of object reduct algorithm on maoea and vice versa have been rare investig
this paper studi the interdepend of object reduct algorithm on maoea
experiment result show that combin an object reduct algorithm with an moea can onli success remov redund object when the total number of object is small
in contrast combin the object reduct algorithm with an maoea can success remov redund object even when the total number of object is larg
experiment result also show that object reduct algorithm can signific improv the perform of maoea .
