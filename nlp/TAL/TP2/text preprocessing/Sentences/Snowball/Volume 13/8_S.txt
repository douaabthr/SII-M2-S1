a node-prior base large-scal overlap communiti detect use evolutionari multi-object optim
communiti structur is one of the most import featur in complex network
howev with increas of network scale some exist method cannot effect detect the communiti structur of complex network and the avail method most aim at non-overlap network
in this paper we focus on overlap communiti detect in large-scal network becaus most of the communiti in real-world network are overlap
in order to improv the accuraci of large-scal overlap communiti detect we suggest a communiti detect method base on node prioriti
the propos algorithm has two advantag 1 we defin a prioriti function text f _ text nn to assess the close between adjac node
it explor the potenti communiti structur in advanc and reduc the scale of network
2 we employ nsga-ii and select all pareto front to mine large-scal overlap communiti
the propos algorithm is test by the artifici and real dataset
the result show that the propos algorithm can effect improv the accuraci of communiti detect and has better optim effect .
