perform evalu of botnet ddos attack detect use machin learn
botnet is regard as one of the most sophist vulner threat nowaday
a larg portion of network traffic is domin by botnet
botnet are conglomer of trade pcs bot which are remot control by their origin botmast under a command and-control c c foundat
they are the key to sever internet assault like spam distribut denial of servic attack ddos rebat distort malwar and phish
to over the problem of ddos attack various machin learn method typic support vector machin svm artifici neural network ann naïv bay nb decis tree dt and unsupervis learn usml k-mean x-mean etc . were propos
with the increas popular of machin learn in the field of comput secur it will be a remark accomplish to carri out perform assess of the machin learn method given a common platform
this could assist develop in choos a suitabl method for their case studi and assist them in further research
this paper perform an experiment analysi of the machin learn method for botnet ddos attack detect
the evalu is done on the unbs-nb 15 and kdd99 which are well-known public dataset for botnet ddos attack detect
machin learn method typic support vector machin svm artifici neural network ann naïv bay nb decis tree dt and unsupervis learn usml are investig for accuraci fals alarm rate far sensit specif fals posit rate fpr auc and matthew correl coeffici mcc of dataset
perform of kdd99 dataset has been experiment shown to be better as compar to the unbs-nb 15 dataset
this valid is signific in comput secur and other relat field .
