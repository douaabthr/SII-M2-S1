optim train artifici neural network for telugu speaker diarize
speaker index or diarize is the process of automat partit the convers involv multipl speaker into homogen segment and group togeth all the segment that correspond to the same speaker
so far certain work have been done under this aspect still the need of accur partit process get lag under certain criteria
with this in mind this paper aim to introduc a new speaker index or diarize model telugu languag that initi involv mel frequenc cepstral coeffici base featur extract
subsequ a new optim artifici neural network ann is introduc for cluster process
the novelti behind the cluster process is the train of ann take place through optim logic that updat the weight of ann by a hybrid concept of artifici bee coloni abc and lion algorithm la
therebi the propos model is name as ann-abc-la model
final the perform of the propos ann-abc-la model is compar over the state-of-the-art model with respect to differ perform measur .
