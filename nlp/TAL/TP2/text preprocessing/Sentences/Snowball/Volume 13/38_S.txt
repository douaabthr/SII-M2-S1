imag the search space a nature-inspir metaheurist extens
human have a long histori of explor throughout which they have devis mani imag technolog such as telescop radar and satellit to increas the level of effect and success of their expedit
this paper propos the use of imag concept to support the search effort of metaheurist that deploy expedit team simul among other thing ant bird and chromosom to explor the search space of optim problem
the research involv propos and develop a set of experiment imag techniqu
anoth purpos of the paper is to measur the effect of those propos imag techniqu on improv the perform of metaheurist search that start from initi popul
as a case studi an extend to particl swarm optim metaheurist algorithm has been perform by implement and incorpor the propos imag techniqu and benchmark them on a platform for compar continu optim in a black box set call coco
the perform of the develop techniqu has been evalu against each other and against the particl swarm optim algorithm alon base on the criterion of how mani function evalu were requir to reach the set of target valu defin by coco platform
the result show that the use of imag could produc better result .
