a novel method for high-level synthesi of datapath in digit filter use a moth-flam optim algorithm
high-level synthesi hls is one of the most import process in digit vlsi circuit design
owe to complex and enorm of the design space in hls problem employ meta-heurist method and swarm intellig has been consid as a high favor option when solv such problem
this research work propos a moth-flam optim mfo algorithm-bas method for hls of datapath in digit filter where schedul alloc and bind step were perform simultan
it was observ that the effici of the propos method enjoy an improv effici thank to the mention simultan step while be combin with the mfo algorithm
by compar the perform of the propos method with genet algorithm base method and particl swarm optim base method for hls of digit filter benchmark it can be infer that the propos method outperform the other two method in hls of digit filter
this is evid approv by a maximum improv observ in the rate of the delay the occupi area of the chip and the power consumpt for 2.99% 6.58% and 6.48% respect
in addit to the mention improv anoth strike characterist of the propos method is it fast runtim in reach a respons
this could signific lower the cost while increas the design speed of circuit have larg dimens
as well an averag 20% rise was also discern in the algorithm runtim compar to the other two method .
