perform evalu of support vector machin and convolut neural network algorithm in real-tim vehicl type and color classif
in order for traffic manag and inform system to provid proper traffic flow it is necessari to obtain inform about traffic with the help of various sensor
in this context in recent year the use of video camera in traffic observ and control has becom veri widespread and activ use
numer studi such as licens plate recognit vehicl number find traffic intens determin vehicl speed calcul band violat and vehicl classif can be done with the help of video process base video monitor system
traffic surveil video are veri activ use for this purpos
in this paper we have develop a system that classifi vehicl accord to their type
first we creat a vehicl dataset from an uncalibr camera
then we test tiny-yolo real-tim object detect and classif system and support vector machin svm classifi model on our dataset and well-known public bit-vehicl dataset in term of recal precis and intersect over union perform metric
experiment result show that two method can be use to classifi real-tim stream traffic video data .
