triclust of gene express microarray data use coars grain and dynam deme base parallel genet approach
interpret of microarray data is often crucial in various aspect of comput analysi
dozen of techniqu like cluster subspace-clust are often appli to these dataset to pluck-out signific result that provid solut to drug discoveri diseas identif like practic healthcar problem
cluster techniqu are use to group the gene exhibit similar behavior under particular condit
this classic method fail while the group of gene is done accord to a subset of condit as it perform global
biclust address success this issu have constraint for evalu of gene group onli under a subset of the condit
howev one of the limit of the biclust techniqu is it is not capabl to analyz the longitudin experi which consid differ time point for the analysi of the gene express profil under a subset of condit
this affair motiv to adopt triclust on gene express microarray data
triclust usual find a set of gene of similar behavior under a subset of condit under certain time point
in this research articl two new framework base on differ version of parallel genet algorithm are propos to detect signific triclust in gene express profil
in the first framework the propos algorithm is base on coars grain parallel genet approach and in the second framework the propos algorithm is base on the dynam deme parallel genet approach
both of them consid the experiment condit and along with the time point with an advantag of parallel the process and reduc the comput time
the propos framework are test on a standard yeast cell cycl saccharomyc cerevisia dataset and on it differ synthet version which are wide use in the gene express analysi
the perform analysi is done with respect to the aspect like the converg speed of both the algorithm for differ input size and with respect to the comput time
the statist analysi is perform follow by the biolog relev of the simul result is establish with their function annot deriv from the gene ontolog and kegg pathway analysi graph
the perform of the propos framework demonstr it effect with the other state-of-the-art scheme
experiment result reveal that the propos architectur are effici as they consum less comput time due to their inher parallel behavior
final the suggest architectur are consid as reliabl framework and can be prefer over the tradit genet approach to analyz the gene express microarray data from the triclust prospect .
