singl layer chebyshev neural network model with regression-bas weight for solv nonlinear ordinari differenti equat
in this investig a novel singl layer function link neural network name chebyshev artifici neural network chann model with regression-bas weight has been develop to handl ordinari differenti equat
in chann the hidden layer is remov by an artifici expans block of the input pattern by use chebyshev polynomi
thus the techniqu is more effectu than the multilay ann
initi weight from the input layer to the output layer are taken by a regression-bas model
here feed-forward structur and back-propag algorithm of the unsupervis version have been util to make the error valu minim
numer exampl and comparison with other method exhibit the superior behavior of this techniqu .
