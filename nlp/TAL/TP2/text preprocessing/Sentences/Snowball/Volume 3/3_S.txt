a learn classifi system with mutual-information-bas fit
this paper introduc a new varieti of learn classifi system lcs call milc which util mutual inform as fit feedback
unlik most lcss milc is specif design for supervis learn
we present experiment result and contrast them to result from xcs uc gassist biohel c4 . 5 and naïv bay
we discuss the explanatori power of the result rule set
milc is also shown to promot the discoveri ofdefault hierarchi an import advantag of lcss
final comment includ futur direct for this research includ investig in neural network and other system .
