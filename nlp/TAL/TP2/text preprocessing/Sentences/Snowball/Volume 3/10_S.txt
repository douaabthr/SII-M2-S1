gpu implement of a road sign detector base on particl swarm optim
road sign detect is a major goal of the advanc drive assist system
most publish work on this problem share the same approach by which sign are first detect and then classifi in video sequenc even if differ techniqu are use
while detect is usual perform use classic comput vision techniqu base on color and/or shape match most often classif is perform by neural network
in this work we present a novel modular and scalabl approach to road sign detect base on particl swarm optim which take into account both shape and color to detect sign
in our approach in particular the optim of a singl fit function allow both to detect a sign belong to a certain categori and at the same time to estim it posit with respect to the camera refer frame
to speed up process the algorithm implement exploit the parallel comput capabl offer by modern graphic card and in particular by the comput unifi devic architectur by nvidia
the effect of the approach has been assess on both synthet and real video sequenc which have been success process at or close to full frame rate .
