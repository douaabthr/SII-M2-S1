real-world transfer of evolv artifici immun system behaviour between small and larg scale robot platform
in mobil robot a solid test for adapt is the abil of a control system to function not onli in a divers number of physic environ but also on a number of differ robot platform
this paper demonstr that a set of behaviour evolv in simul on a miniatur robot epuck can be transfer to a much larger-scal platform pioneer both in simul and in the real world
the chosen architectur use artifici evolut of epuck behaviour to obtain a genet sequenc which is then employ to seed an idiotyp artifici immun system ai on the pioneer
despit numer hardwar and softwar differ between the platform navig and target-find experi show that the evolv behaviour transfer veri well to the larger robot when the idiotyp ai techniqu is use
in contrast transfer is poor when reinforc learn alon is use which valid the adapt of the chosen architectur .
