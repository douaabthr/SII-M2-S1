collect neuro-evolut for evolv special sensor resolut in a multi-rov task
this articl present result from an evalu of the collect neuro-evolut cone control design method
cone solv collect behavior task and increas task perform via facilit emerg behavior special
emerg special is guid by genotyp and behavior special differ metric that regul genotyp recombin
cone is compar test and evalu with similar neuro-evolut method in an extens of the multi-rov task where behavior special is known to benefit task perform
the task is for multipl simul autonom vehicl rover to maxim the detect of point of interest red rock in a virtual environ
result indic that cone is appropri for deriv set of special rover behavior that complement each other such that a higher task perform compar to relat control design method is attain in the multi-rov task .
