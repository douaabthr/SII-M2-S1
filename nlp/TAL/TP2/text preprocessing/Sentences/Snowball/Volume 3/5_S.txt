multi-stag fuzzi evalu in evolutionari robot vision for face detect
this paper propos a method of evolutionari robot vision base on a local genet algorithm base on cluster lgac and multi-stag fuzzi evalu
in order to improv the communic capabl of human-friend partner robot the human face should be extract as correct as possibl
first we discuss the concept of evolutionari robot vision in dynam environ
next we propos grow neural gas for preprocess as a bottom up process and local genet algorithm base on cluster for templat match in human face detect as a top down process
in order to improv the perform of the human face detect we use multi-stag fuzzi evalu for evalu the degre of human face
final we show sever experiment result and discuss the effect of the propos method .
