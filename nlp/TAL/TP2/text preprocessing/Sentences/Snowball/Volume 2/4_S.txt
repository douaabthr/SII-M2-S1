multi-object evolutionari learn of granular membership function paramet and rule of mamdani fuzzi system
in this paper we propos a multi-object evolutionari algorithm moea to generat mamdani fuzzi rule-bas system with differ trade-off between accuraci and complex by learn concurr granular of the input and output partit membership function mf paramet and rule
to this aim we introduc the concept of virtual and concret partit the former is defin by uniform partit each linguist variabl with a fix maximum number of fuzzi set the latter take into account for each variabl the number of fuzzi set determin by the evolutionari process
rule base and mf paramet are defin on the virtual partit and whenev a fit evalu is requir map to the concret partit by employ appropri map strategi
the implement of the moea reli on a chromosom compos of three part which codifi the partit granular the virtual rule base and the membership function paramet respect and on purposely-defin genet oper
the moea has been test on three real-world regress problem achiev veri promis result
in particular we highlight how start from random generat solut the moea is abl to determin differ granular for differ variabl achiev good trade-off between complex and accuraci .
