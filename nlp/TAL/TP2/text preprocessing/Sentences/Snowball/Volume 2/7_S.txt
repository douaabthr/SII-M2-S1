evolut of visual control for obstacl avoid in mobil robot
the purpos of this work is to automat design vision algorithm for a mobil robot adapt to it current visual context
in this paper we address the particular task of obstacl avoid use monocular vision
start from a set of primit compos of the differ techniqu found in the literatur we propos a generic structur to repres the algorithm use standard resolut video sequenc as an input and veloc command to control a wheel robot as an output
grammar rule are then use to construct correct instanc of algorithm that are then evalu use differ protocol evalu of trajectori perform in a goal reach task or imit of a hand-guid trajectori
a genet program is appli to evolv popul of algorithm in order to optim the perform of the control
the first result obtain in a simul environ show that the evolut produc algorithm that can be easili interpret and which are clear adapt to the visual context
howev the result trajectori are often errat and the general capac are poor
to improv the result we propos to use a two-phas evolut combin imit and goal reach evalu and to add some constraint in the grammar rule to enforc a more generic behavior
the result obtain in simul show that the evolv algorithm are more effici and more generic
final we appli the imit base evolut on real sequenc and test the evolv algorithm on a real robot
though simplifi by drop the goal reach constraint the result algorithm behav well in a corridor center task and show certain general capac .
