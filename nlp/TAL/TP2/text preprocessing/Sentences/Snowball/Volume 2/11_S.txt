special issu on simul evolut and learn
the field of natur comput is one of the fastest grow area in comput scienc and engin
although it origin can be trace back to the cybernet movement of the 1950s it has undergon a renaiss sinc the mid-1980 s primarili due to the fundament work by pioneer for exampl john holland ken de jong david goldberg john koza lawrenc fogel in the genet and evolutionari algorithm domain . problem solv techniqu base on simul evolut and learn encapsul a wide varieti of natur comput implement
these algorithm implement as comput simul typic includ a two-step iter process the generat of random variat follow by select
as the model is iter good optim solut emerg
evolutionari algorithm typic do not make assumpt about the under search space
as such they provid a mean for tackl hard practic problem one involv larg complex search space
over the past decad evolutionari optim and learn algorithm have been appli success to a wide varieti of real-world problem . this special issu bring togeth recent contribut in the evolutionari optimis and learn domain span a divers rang of topic
the four paper includ in this special issu were among the invit submiss from seal08 the 7th intern confer on simul evolut and learn
each of the submit paper was substanti revis and extend base on the origin confer version
the extend paper were then rigor review in two round by at least three anonym review
the high qualiti contribut introduc below clear reflect the strong interest in simul evolut and learn as a practic problem solv vehicl .
