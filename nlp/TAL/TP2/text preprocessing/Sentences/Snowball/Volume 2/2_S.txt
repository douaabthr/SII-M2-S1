multiag coevolutionari genet fuzzi system to develop bid strategi in electr market comput econom to assess mechan design
this paper suggest a genet fuzzi system approach to develop bid strategi for agent in onlin auction environ
assess effici bid strategi is a key to evalu auction model and verifi if the under mechan design achiev it intend goal
due to it relev in current energi market worldwid we use day-ahead electr auction as an experiment and applic instanc of the approach develop in this paper
success fuzzi bid strategi have been develop by genet fuzzi system use coevolutionari algorithm
in this paper we address a coevolutionari fuzzi system algorithm and present recent result concern bid strategi behavior
coevolutionari approach develop by coevolutionari agent interact through their fuzzi bid strategi in a multiag environ and allow realist and transpar represent of agent behavior in auction-bas market
they also improv market represent and evalu mechan
in particular we studi how the coevolutionari fuzzi bid strategi perform against each other dure hour electr energi auction
experiment result show that coevolutionari agent may enhanc their profit at the cost of increas system hour price paid by demand .
