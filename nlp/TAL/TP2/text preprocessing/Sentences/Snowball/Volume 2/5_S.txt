evolutionari parallel and gradual distribut later tune of fuzzi rule-bas system
the tune of fuzzi rule-bas system is often appli to improv their perform as a post-process stage onc an initi set of fuzzi rule has been extract
this optim problem can becom a hard one when the size of the consid system in term of the number of variabl rule and particular data sampl is big
distribut genet algorithm are excel optim algorithm which exploit the nowaday avail parallel hardwar multicor microprocessor and cluster and could help to allevi this growth in complex
in this work we present a studi on the use of the distribut genet algorithm for the tune of fuzzi rule-bas system
to this end we analyz the applic of a specif gradual distribut real-cod genet algorithm which employ eight subpopul in a hypercub topolog and local parallel at each subpopul
we test our approach on nine real-world dataset of differ size and with differ number of variabl
the empir perform in solut qualiti and comput time is assess by compar it result with those from a high effect sequenti tune algorithm
the result show that the distribut approach achiev better result in term of qualiti and execut time as the complex of the problem grow .
