sequenti problem that test general in learn classifi system
we present an approach to build sequenti decis make problem which can test the general capabl of classifi system
the approach can be appli to ani sequenti problem defin over a binari domain and it generat a new problem with bound sequenti difficulti and bound general difficulti
as an exampl we appli the approach to generat two problem with simpl sequenti structur huge number of state more than a million and mani general
these problem are use to compar a classifi system with effect general xcs and a learner without general q-learn
the experiment result confirm what was previous found main use single-step problem also in sequenti problem with huge state space xcs can general effect by detect those substructur that are necessari for optim sequenti behavior .
