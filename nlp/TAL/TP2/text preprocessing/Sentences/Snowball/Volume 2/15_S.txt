the effect of time-vari reward on the evolut of cooper
understand how cooper behavior emerg within a popul of autonom individu has been the focus of a great deal of research in biolog econom and more recent in the multi-ag system domain
howev there are still mani open question
in this paper we address some of these question by investig the effect of time-vari non-symmetr reward on the evolut of cooper in the spatial prison s dilemma game
the rational behind this approach is base on the notion that the associ payoff from pursu certain strategi do vari among member of real-world popul
in our model agent with limit cognit capac play the game with their local neighbour
in addit to it game play strategi each agent has addit attribut that can be use to control the number of round of the game the agent actual particip in as well as the magnitud of ani reward that it receiv
numer simul show that dynam updat to payoff valu induc a chang in equilibrium cooper level
this suggest that heterogen payoff valu and social divers within a cost-benefit context are import factor in the promot of cooper in the spatial prison s dilemma game .
