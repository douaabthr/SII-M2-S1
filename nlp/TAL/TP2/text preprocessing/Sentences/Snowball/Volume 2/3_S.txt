rule base and adapt fuzzi oper cooper learn of mamdani fuzzi system with multi-object genet algorithm
in this paper we present an evolutionari multi-object learn model achiev cooper between the rule base and the adapt fuzzi oper of the infer system in order to obtain simpler more compact and still accur linguist fuzzi model by learn fuzzi infer adapt oper togeth with rule
the multi-object evolutionari algorithm propos generat a set of fuzzi rule base system with differ trade-off between interpret and accuraci allow the design to select the one that involv the most suitabl balanc for the desir applic
we develop an experiment studi test our approach with some variant on nine real-world regress dataset find the advantag of cooper compar to sequenti model as well as multi-object compar with single-object model
the studi is elabor compar differ approach by appli non-parametr statist test for pair-wis
result confirm the use of the propos approach .
