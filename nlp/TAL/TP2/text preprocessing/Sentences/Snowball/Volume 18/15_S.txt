evolutionari multitask algorithm base on a dynam solut encod strategi for the minimum s-club cover problem
the problem of find a cohes subgraph notabl thes-club model which is a subgraph with diamet at most is a wide appli topic in social network analysi and group of object model
in particular the minimum s-club cover problem min s-club cover is a recent introduc variant in the literatur which ask to cover the vertic of a graph with a minimum number ofs-club
the exist of common connect among these high connect compon encourag the applic of multitask optim to leverag the share meaning knowledg in the discoveri of multiples-club at the same time
therefor this studi propos a multitask evolutionari algorithm to solv the minimums-club cover problem
our propos is design with an effect solut represent method and evolutionari oper for the variat in the number of club
each solut is repres by two compon where the gene number of a compon can be differ for each individu and can chang dure perform evolutionari oper
we also propos a solut generat method base on a random greedi algorithm that help to ensur individu qualiti and popul divers in the initi popul
the propos algorithm is evalu on two dataset in the dimac librari
this studi then analyz the influenc of differ factor of the input data on the propos algorithm result
base on statist analysi of the perform result it is clear that our propos s solut is superior to an exist algorithm on two-third of the experiment data set .
