enhanc fraction probabilist self-organ map with genet algorithm optim ef-prsom
the fraction deriv offer an effect method for incorpor memori into system increas effici for task that requir long-term memori process
they provid consider advantag over classic deriv enabl deeper analysi of complex process through effect access to under aspect
leverag these benefit this paper introduc a new cluster approach enhanc fraction probabilist self-organ map and genet algorithm optim
this approach address the problem of kernel local and the challeng associ with select the paramet alpha
to determin the appropri order of alpha we implement an effici method use genet algorithm optim enhanc cluster qualiti by consid model complex good of fit and cluster separ
furthermor the optim ef-prsom was compar to sever cluster method across multipl dataset use the dunn index
remark ef-prsom consist outperform it counterpart across all metric
addit the optim ef-prsom has the potenti to be appli to various task includ imag compress where it effect could be assess use perform measur such as peak signal-to-nois ratio and structur similar index
this highlight the versatil of the propos ef-prsom method across differ applic .
