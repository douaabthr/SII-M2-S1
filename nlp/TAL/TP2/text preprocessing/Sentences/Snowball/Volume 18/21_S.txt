modifi random-opposit chaotic artifici rabbit optim algorithm for solv structur problem and optim size of hybrid renew energi system
the artifici rabbit optim aro algorithm replic the surviv skill of rabbit in the wild
howev like other metaheurist approach it possess signific drawback in solv challeng problem includ sluggish converg rate poor explor abil and trap in local optima region
to allevi these shortcom a novel strategi name modifi random opposit mro and ten chaotic map are integr with aro term as mrocaro
this implement mro techniqu boost the popul divers and permit the popul to escap from local optima while integr of chaotic map enhanc the exploit capabl
to estim the effect of the mrocaro method the well-known cec2005 cec2017 cec2019 and cec2008lsgo test function are consid
moreov non-parametr test that includ the wilcoxon rank-sum and friedman rank test are perform to analyz the signific differ among the compar algorithm
furthermor the effici of the mrocaro algorithm has been evalu on various structur problem and optim size of renew energi system
the experiment find demonstr that mrocaro perform optimum solut with 100% renew sourc with the lowest level cost of electr of 0.0934 kwh as compar to other method
also the simul find reveal that mrocaro has immens potenti for address global optim and structur problem as contrast to other compet algorithm .
