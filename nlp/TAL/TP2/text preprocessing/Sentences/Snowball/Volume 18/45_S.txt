hybrid multi-object particl swarm optim featur select approach with firefli algorithm use decis tree classifi
in machin learn the import of relev data increas exponenti
in our propos approach we introduc an optim method that combin particl swarm optim pso and the firefli algorithm fa to enhanc featur select use decis tree-bas classif
pso is well-suit for small search space while the firefli algorithm is effect for larg search space
the propos method psofa-dt aim to improv classif perform by reduc dimension and optim featur select
pso s global search capabl are complement by fa s local search and the algorithm s effect is evalu use decis tree accuraci and hold-out cross-valid
experiment result demonstr that psofa-dt outperform individu implement of pso and fa in featur reduct and classif accuraci
decis tree accuraci is use as the primari fit metric while the firefli algorithm refin the featur select process
the algorithm balanc explor and exploit by adjust key paramet such as inertia weight learn factor and attract coeffici
the firefli algorithm further optim featur select enhanc decis tree perform .
