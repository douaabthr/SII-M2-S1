evolutionari algorithm framework for optim truck schedul in multi-dock truck cross-dock center
cross-dock optim logist by reduc storag and handl time in warehous where cargo are unload from inbound truck and load direct onto outbound vehicl
this paper address the critic challeng of minim makespan in a multi-dock parallel machin set within cross-dock center
we propos a novel framework that integr an evolutionari algorithm ea with a machin learn ml base hyperparamet tune mechan to optim truck sequenc
this studi fill the research gap by offer a quantifi improv over tradit heurist method deliv up to a 37% improv in the gap metric compar to state-of-the-art techniqu
it also achiev a 30% enhanc over the pch construct heurist use for generat initi solut
addit our ml-base tune strategi provid up to a 21% perform increas over static tune method
notabl these improv are attain while maintain a competit comput time as report in the literatur .
