flose flowerwork-bas stack ensembl framework for classif of chronic diseas
this studi present a novel approach for detect and classifi chronic diseas cds focus on preval condit such as asthma cancer and chronic obstruct pulmonari diseas copd
earli identif of these diseas is challeng due to overlap symptom limit clinic expertis and variat in devic sensit
to address this this studi propos flose a multi-optimization-bas stack ensembl model integr the firework and flower pollin algorithm
it oper in three stage featur select optim model generat and stack ensembl model creation aim to detect cds and distinguish symptomat similar condit like copd and asthma
the model s effect was evalu use two dataset exasen and breast cancer
the stack ensembl framework consist of four base classifi random forest support vector machin multilay perceptron mlp and extratre et with their predict aggreg by the meta-learn extrem learn machin
experiment result show that flose outperform individu base classifi achiev 96.25% accuraci 96.24% precis 96.25% recal and a 96% f1-score for exasen and 95.6% accuraci 95% precis 95.1% recal and a 96% f1-score for breast cancer
these find highlight flose as a promis approach for accur chronic diseas detect and classif .
