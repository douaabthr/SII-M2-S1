adapt ant coloni optim for solv dynam vehicl and drone rout with time window constraint
this paper propos a novel extens to the tradit vehicl rout problem by introduc the dynam vehicl rout problem with drone consid time window
this new problem incorpor dynam request handl and the innov use of drone to address deliveri challeng within specif time constraint
to tackl dynam vehicl rout problem with drone consid time window we develop an adapt ant coloni optim algorithm
in which initi rout are construct to handl known request establish a baselin solut
the algorithm adapt to real-tim request in the dynam phase by transfer pheromon valu between time step to find the best solut at each iter
this mechan effect exploit past solut and explor high-qual rout for new request with strict time window
our propos algorithm is valid through extens experiment scenario that simul various spatial distribut and time-sensit demand
result show that our method produc high-qual solut compar to exist heurist and nature-inspir method particular in complex environ with random request and tight time constraint .
