hybrid pso-ga optim for enhanc decis tree perform in soil classif and crop cultiv predict
agricultur hold profound signific in the live and livelihood of bangladesh s popul
the escal popul has contribut to a reduct in avail arabl land exacerb concern about the feasibl of farm
in various region of bangladesh there is a prevail percept that certain area are unsuit for cultiv
consequ a substanti amount of land still need to be tap and explor for agricultur purpos contribut to underutil and hinder potenti agricultur develop in these region
consid these issu this studi seek to forecast the optim crop choic for specif soil class enabl individu to make more inform decis about crop cultiv on their land
initi the soil class is identifi base on it uniqu characterist within a given area and subsequ crop select is determin base on these distinct soil class
this studi explor the perform of particl swarm optim pso and genet algorithm ga
it propos a hybrid pso-ga techniqu to optim the decis tree model for forecast crop cultiv base on classifi soil
the perform of a standalon decis tree model is also measur
in soil classif the hybrid pso-ga approach demonstr superior perform achiev an accuraci of 96.04% surpass individu pso ga and standalon decis tree method
in crop cultiv predict the hybrid approach outperform individu pso ga and decis tree method with an accuraci of 92.63%
the result highlight the efficaci of the integr pso-ga strategi in optim the dt model for precis agricultur predict
this research contribut valuabl insight for enhanc decis support system in agricultur provid a promis avenu for improv accuraci in soil classif and crop cultiv predict .
