multi-strategi improv black-wing kite algorithm and it applic in short-term load forecast use gate recurr unit neural network
to enhanc global search capabl and converg effici of the black kite algorithm bka this paper propos a multi-strategi improv black kite algorithm swbka
first latin hypercub sampl is introduc to improv the initi popul qualiti
second a fuse cauchy-gaussian disturb and adapt spiral posit updat strategi is propos to balanc the global search and local exploit capabl dure the migrat behavior
final a len imag revers learn elit strategi is incorpor to help the algorithm effect avoid local optima
ablat experi on the three strategi were conduct use 13 benchmark function and the perform of the improv algorithm was valid on 42 function
experiment result show that the propos swbka achiev an overal averag improv of 47.38% in optim valu compar to bka demonstr signific superior
furthermor the propos swbka was use to optim the hyperparamet of the gate recurr unit neural network follow by predict experi on an actual electr load dataset
the experiment result demonstr the algorithm s capabl to solv real-world problem
