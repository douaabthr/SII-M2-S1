reliability-bas multi-object optim of truss with greylag goos algorithm
this paper introduc a multi-object variant of the greylag goos optim moggo to tackl complex structur optim problem
inspir by the cooper behavior of gees in flight moggo employ dynam group to enhanc problem-solv effici
six truss structur undergo simultan topolog shape and size optim use moggo aim to maxim reliabl while minim structur mass
by incorpor non-domin sort and archiv techniqu moggo extend the single-object greylag goos optim to effect address trade-off between compet object
evalu metric and statist test demonstr moggo s superior perform in handl larg structur optim problem preserv more pareto-optim set and achiev greater converg and varianc in object and decis space
moggo s abil to manag conflict object is further valid through divers analysi with swarm plot illustr it superior converg behavior across iter
overal moggo prove to be an effici and effect approach for address challeng reliability-bas multi-object structur optim problem .
