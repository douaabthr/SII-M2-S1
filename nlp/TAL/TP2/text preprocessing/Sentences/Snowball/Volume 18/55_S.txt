global optim through promethee-driven tri-point select base genet algorithm
to address the limit of convent select techniqu like roulett wheel select and stochast univers sampl sus this studi introduc the tri-point select tps oper an innov enhanc for genet algorithm gas
use cec 2017 benchmark function across differ dimens
the propos select scheme tps achiev optimum mean valu 35% outperform rw 15% ts 24% and sus 25%
while the averag standard deviat of tps 39% is higher compar to rw 26% sus 20% and ts 15% tps demonstr superior consist by achiev the least standard deviat in 33 out of 84 case
this balanc between explor and stabil enabl tps to deliv a higher percentag of ideal result show it robust across divers optim scenario
promethe analysi further confirm tps s effect in maintain an optim balanc between explor and exploit lead to improv converg perform
this advanc not onli refin ga select process but also open new avenu for tps s applic in solv complex optim challeng .
