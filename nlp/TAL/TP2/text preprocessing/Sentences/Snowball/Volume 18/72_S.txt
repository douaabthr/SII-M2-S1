enhanc object recognit a comprehens analysi of cnn base deep learn model consid light condit and perspect
object recognit is crucial in comput vision enabl applic like autonom vehicl navig inventori manag medic imag process robot traffic signal verif and virtual realiti
yet factor such as light condit and perspect can impact the qualiti of object detect in both standalon imag and real-tim feed
this paper review recent object recognit model concentr on challeng relat to light and perspect
it offer an in-depth analysi of contemporari deep learn model for object detect highlight their architectur and perform
the studi also scrutin the differ dataset use in these model
final it identifi research gap and propos potenti solut for futur research direct in comput vision to enhanc object recognit effici .
