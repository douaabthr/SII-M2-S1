a method for obstacle-rang estim base on echo-loc use high-end sound with applic
effici map algorithm have been implement in differ field of robot applic
some of those applic are in the map of environ with difficult access the plan of servic or emerg assist robot or as support tool in help peopl with disabl
in those exampl the essenti task of a map algorithm is to detect obstacl which may interfer in motion path
one of the most wide use characterist in pulse-echo rang estim is the time of flight
howev the ultrason frequenc rang from 30 to 120 khz are poor suitabl for the long distanc face in in-door applic
in view of the import of develop effici map algorithm the present manuscript report on an effici method base on high-frequ wave in order to rang static object under a control environ
in the present approach the signal acquisit is made out-of-band of the process algorithm
this process is carri out by use an activ speaker to throw the control ping sound
the result audio is captur through a unidirect dynam microphon shure sv100
the audio signal process is base on select filter via gabor model and wavelet decim de-nois
the propos method is compar against two common methodolog for rang estim in robot base on ultrason and infrar sensor
the current methodolog demonstr a competit and in some case better perform than the standard method .
