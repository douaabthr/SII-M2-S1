group decis make approach base on linguist q-rung orthopair fuzzi yager power weight geometr aggreg oper for select of nanoparticl in drug deliveri system
lung cancer remain one of the most preval and dead form of cancer worldwid with a high mortal rate and limit treatment option avail
tradit chemotherapi and radiat therapi have been the mainstay of lung cancer treatment but their efficaci is often limit by system toxic and drug resist
recent mani nanoparticl have been identifi and creat for drug deliveri with the abil to specif target tumor cell while spare healthi cell or organ
the nanoparticle-bas drug deliveri system offer distinct benefit over convent medic deliveri includ increas permeabl and retent effect precis target and improv stabil and biocompat
therefor this paper propos the group decis make approach under linguist q-rung orthopair fuzzi environ to select the best nanoparticl in drug deliveri system for lung cancer treatment
first this paper propos linguist q-rung orthopair fuzzi yager power weight geometr aggreg oper for aggreg the linguist q-rung orthopair fuzzi number base on the yager s norm
this paper also demonstr sever featur of the propos oper
moreov by use the propos oper this paper present the group decis make approach
furthermor a case studi is present for the select of optim nanoparticl in drug deliveri for the treatment of lung cancer to demonstr the propos decis make approach s applic
final this paper present comparison studi sensit analysi and superior of propos decis make approach with the other exist decis make method to valid the propos decis make approach .
