explor the effect of machin learn model on livestock behavior classif use 9 axial inerti sensor
understand the anim behavior has alway been challeng for human
fortun the recent develop in electron sensor can be help in analyz and understand the anim behavior
this work aim to explor the potenti of use 9 axial inerti sensor and machin learn algorithm to understand the anim behavior more accur
this studi use a dataset collect from cow equip with 9 axial inerti sensor on their collar
the collect data is analyz use various machin learn algorithm to classifi the cattl s behavior in differ class includ stand sit eat rumin etc
the find of this research have signific implic for health manag and livestock manag as the accur classif of behavior can assist cattl farmer in monitor and manag their herd more effici
the studi also highlight the potenti of use technolog to improv our understand of anim behavior which can have signific impact for anim welfar and conserv effort .
