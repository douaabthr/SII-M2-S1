advanc ceemd hybrid model for vix forecast optim decis tree and arima integr
this studi focus on the time seri analysi and forecast of the volatil index vix data in the unit state
we employ the complet empir mode decomposit ceemd method to decompos the origin vix data into seven intrins mode function imf
subsequ each imf determin it stationar use the augment dickey-ful adf test
for stationari imf an autoregress integr move averag arima model was built while non-stationari imf were fit use machin learn regress algorithm
the sum of the predict valu of all imf was consid as the forecast vix valu
about the paramet select in machin learn algorithm we employ the optuna librari to optim the model s paramet
we select the paramet that result in the lowest mean squar error mse on a valid set to be the optim model paramet
appli this methodolog we found that our hybrid model has greater predict capabl compar to simpl machin learn model when the market fluctuat great
specif the adaboost model outperform a basic decis tree model and a random forest model in term of mse and mae mean absolut error accuraci .
