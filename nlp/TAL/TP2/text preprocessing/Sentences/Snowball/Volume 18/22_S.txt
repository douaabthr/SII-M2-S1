machin learn with industri robot explor the impact of joint angl on cartesian coordin use explain ai
this studi use explain artifici intellig techniqu to reveal the complex relationship between joint angl and cartesian coordin in the context of industri robot arm
by use machin learn and explain artifici intellig algorithm it is aim to distinguish the domin effect of individu joint angl on the x y and z coordin of the robot end effector
various machin learn algorithm have been appli on the data set and perform output have been obtain
accord to these perform result it has been observ that the randomforest algorithm is more suitabl for our studi than other model with it low mean squar error and high r-squar score
along with the select machin learn algorithm the data set was tri to be explain by pass it through shapley addit explan shap descript machin learn explan dalex and explain like i m 5 eli5 model which are explain artifici intellig model
it has been observ that the shap model explain the effect of joint angl on cartesian coordin more consist than other model with an averag sensit of 0.0125 valu rang . our find shed light on the explain aspect of ai model and provid valuabl inform about the fundament mechan govern the complex movement of industri robot arm .
