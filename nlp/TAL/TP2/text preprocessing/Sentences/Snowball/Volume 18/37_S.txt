document cluster with evolv multi-word search queri
text cluster hold signific valu across various domain due to it abil to identifi pattern and group relat inform
current approach which reli heavili on a comput similar measur between document are often limit in accuraci and interpret
we present a novel approach to the problem base on a set of evolv search queri
cluster are form as the set of document match by a singl search queri in the set of queri
the queri are optim to maxim the number of document return and to minim the overlap between cluster document return by more than one queri
where queri contain more than one word they are interpret disjunct
we have found it use to assign one word to be the root and constrain the queri construct such that the set of document return by ani addit queri word intersect with the set return by the root word
not all document in a collect are return by ani of the search queri in a set so onc the search queri evolut is complet a second stage is perform wherebi a knn algorithm is appli to assign all unassign document to their nearest cluster
we describ the method and present result use 8 text dataset compar effect with well-known exist algorithm
we note that as well as achiev the highest accuraci on these dataset the search queri format provid the qualit benefit of be interpret and modifi whilst provid a causal explan of cluster construct .
