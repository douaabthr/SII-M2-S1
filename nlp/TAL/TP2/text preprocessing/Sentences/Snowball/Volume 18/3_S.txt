an intellectu model of pest detect and classif use enhanc optimization-assist singl shot detector and graph attent network
identifi pest in the plant is consid to be an effici accur and sustain way to improv the food qualiti and econom valu in the agricultur industri
it equip farmer with cutting-edg instrument to safeguard their harvest lessen their effect on the environ and satisfi the grow need for susten on a worldwid scale
deep learn can complet transform the identif of pest as it develop protect agricultur s product and resist against ever-chang insect threat
it can be difficult to combin multipl method for pest identif includ artifici intellig satellit imag and detector
it is difficult to make sure that such innov are avail to farm and function well togeth
it s common for farmer as well as other agricultur personnel to requir certif to proper util pest detect equip and understand the find
for these innov to be wide adopt the gap in understand must be close
address these challeng requir an effect novel deep learning-bas pest detect method
in this paper a deep learning-bas pest detect and classif model is develop to identifi diseas caus by pest at an earli stage
initi the imag are collect from onlin dataset
collect imag underw detect use the adapt singl shot detector assd
to enhanc the accuraci and effici of assd the model paramet are fine-tun by util the enhanc run citi game optim
this optim process aim to improv the precis of pest detect
the classif of pest is done use the propos multi-scal and dilat graph attent network
this innov network architectur is design to categor the pest effect
the outcom of the propos model is justifi by compar it with other classifi and algorithm .
