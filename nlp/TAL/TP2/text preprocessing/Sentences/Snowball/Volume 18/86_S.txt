a novel fuzzy-entropi base onlin fuzzi c-mean cluster algorithm for massiv data
due to the inadequaci of standard cluster approach for handl extens data consider research has recent focus on cluster larg and extrem larg dataset
specif certain variat of the famous fuzzi c-mean algorithm have been put forth test techniqu for segment dataset and aggreg the intermedi cluster result
among them the fuzzi c-mean onlin techniqu is one of the most use for cluster larg amount of data
it split the dataset into equal-s subset or chunk and assign a weight to each chunk depend on the membership degre per cluster
this studi introduc a novel variat of the onlin fuzzi c-mean ofcm algorithm design to boost it perform
our propos method integr a cluster compact measur into the weight attribut process quantifi by the fuzzi entropi of each cluster
compar experi conduct across divers classif dataset of vari scale demonstr that the propos algorithm signific improv the accuraci of cluster result when compar to the standard ofcm
crucial this enhanc is achiev without increas the comput complex of the algorithm
furthermor our approach yield perform compar to that of heurist fuzzi c-mean algorithm while offer the distinct advantag of shorter execut time
futur research will focus on explor featur select and reduct techniqu to adapt the propos algorithm for effect applic to massiv dataset character by an except high number of featur .
