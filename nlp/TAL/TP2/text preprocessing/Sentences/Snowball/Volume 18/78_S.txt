an applic of a two-level genet search for the soft-clust vehicl rout problem
we propos a two-level hybrid genet search hgs for the soft-clust vehicl rout problem softcluvrp an extens of the capacit vrp where custom are group into cluster that vehicl can enter and exit multipl time to reduc cost
the method decompos the problem into cluster-level and node-level subproblem each optim via tailor local search
node-level rout are refin by solv a travel salesman problem for each rout enhanc by seven well-known neighborhood
cluster-level optim repres cluster as sequenc of consecut visit to their node model with a newli introduc sequenc chromosom and optim through a sequence-bas best-insert strategi
a polar sector-bas inter-rout swap further boost effici
test on benchmark instanc the algorithm achiev competit result set 191 new upper bound across 232 case and demonstr strong converg behavior and scalabl
