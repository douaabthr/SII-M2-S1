hgasa an improv hybrid self-adapt metaheurist approach for data cluster
cluster data into coher group is a machin learn unsupervis techniqu that aim to partit the data object into cluster with maximum inter-clust distanc and minimum intra-clust distanc
genet algorithm is a popular metaheurist algorithm with sever shortcom such as local optima trap prematur converg and genet drift problem
consequ to maintain a balanc between intensif and diversif and to resolv the abov issu a new memet algorithm is propos in this paper
the propos approach hgasa is a hybrid of genet and simul anneal algorithm that explor the neighborhood search strategi of the simul anneal algorithm by incorpor it as a local search techniqu after the mutat phase of the genet algorithm
to overwhelm the genet drift problem the propos algorithm s mutat rate is also adjust use a self-adapt factor that reli on the metaheurist search principl
the propos techniqu is valid by compar it perform with a genet algorithm use standard benchmark function
afterward the propos hgasa is simul on nine real-lif and synthet cluster data set
the effici of the propos hybrid approach is prove by compar it with well-known standard metaheurist and recent publish hybrid algorithm use the sum of intra-clust distanc and converg speed as object function
the effect of the propos algorithm is also test as an automat cluster algorithm
comput find reveal that the hgasa cluster techniqu perform better than other metaheurist algorithm
simul result demonstr the abil of the propos hgasa to produc compact and well-separ cluster
addit the friedman statist test and two pair t-test are perform to verifi the suggest hgasa method s exist and find approv the surviv of the hgasa algorithm in the cluster area .
