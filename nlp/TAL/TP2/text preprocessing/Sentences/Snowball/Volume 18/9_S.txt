toward load frequenc manag in thermal power system use an improv open-sourc develop model algorithm
maintain a balanc between generat and consum power is crucial for the effici oper of interconnect power grid
this paper focus on the issu of load frequenc manag in thermal power system
we present a metaheurist approach to address this problem leverag the advantag of metaheurist algorithm in solv complex optim problem
our approach is base on an improv open-sourc develop model algorithm odma
the propos method refer to as odma-ga integr odma with a genet algorithm ga to configur a hybrid optim techniqu
this combin allow for the effect exploit and explor of the search space lead to high-qual solut
we evalu the perform of odma-ga use sever benchmark function with vari scenario
the result demonstr that odma-ga outperform it peer metaheurist algorithm showcas superior optim capabl
this promis perform suggest that odma-ga offer an effect solut for the challeng task of load frequenc manag in thermal power system ensur stabl and effici oper
specif the find show that our method improv the frequenc chang area and tie-lin power chang by 2.3% compar to the best exist method .
