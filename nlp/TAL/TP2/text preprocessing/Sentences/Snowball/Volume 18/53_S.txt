a collabor use of two metaheurist method use q-learn for the travel salesman problem in differ field an applic to smart home deliveri system
this studi propos a metaheurist name abc-ga-ql for the travel salesman problem tsp where the q-learn approach is use to select suitabl metaheurist method in differ iter at run time from two differ type metaheurist methods-artifici bee coloni abc and genet algorithm ga
the algorithm involv two phase
the first phase explor the search space use abc and ga independ to search the promin zone of the optim path
the perform of ga and abc on a target problem are note at each iter use a reward tabl rt and a q-tabl qt
the second phase use the method with better perform in each iter to modifi the popul
the entri of rt and qt are updat accord
in this way abc-ga-ql enhanc the qualiti of the search process
the basic perturb rule of abc is modifi for the tsps use swap oper and the exploit of the method is updat use 3 opt oper
ga is also modifi use multi-point cyclic crossov and 3 opt oper to deal with the tsps
abc-ga-ql is test against a set of asymmetr and symmetr tsps from tsplib with signific larg size
the method find optim path for the instanc have size up to 280 node in most of the run of the algorithm
it perform is compar with some recent publish state-of-the-art algorithm for the tsps use the friedman test and the superior of abc-ga-ql is well establish
the best result obtain in 10 independ run of the method for differ test instanc are list for deep statist comparison in futur studi
some approach are also propos to solv the tsps with cost matric involv fuzzi data
the algorithm is also use to implement a real-lif smart home deliveri system for the onlin busi .
