a lightweight mechan fault diagnosi network driven by cooper neuroevolut algorithm
large-scal mechan fault detect play a critic role in industri product and neural network have been wide adopt for this task
howev the perform of neural network heavili depend on the optim of their architectur and paramet
tradit optim method such as gradient descent and particl swarm optim can improv model perform to some extent but they typic requir adjust all weight which not onli increas comput complex but also often lead to redund network structur
to address these challeng this paper propos a cooper neuroevolut algorithm for construct lightweight neural network tailor for fault diagnosi task
the algorithm introduc two co-evolv populations-on dedic to learn the critic weight of the neural network and the other focus on optim the precis weight valu
this approach enabl the discoveri of a spars connect lightweight neural network
by decoupl and cooper optim network structur and weight the algorithm can more effici explor the search space to identifi model that are both compact and high-perform
to valid the effect of the propos algorithm extens experi are conduct on multipl industri dataset involv large-scal mechan fault detect
the result demonstr that the algorithm maintain high diagnost accuraci while signific reduc the number of model paramet
compar to convent evolutionari algorithm it exhibit superior model compress capabl and general perform .
