selfvarbl a stacking-bas ensembl learn framework with variabl number of base-learn
stack is one of the most popular ensembl learn techniqu that combin the predict of multipl base-learn bls use a meta-learn to improv the overal perform of the model
to build a stacking-bas ensembl most of the exist work select top-k-perform model as the base-learn without consid the comput resourc requir of the system
this work present a stacking-bas ensembl learn framework with a variabl number of base-learn selfvarbl which is capabl of find the trade-off between comput resourc requir and system perform by automat select a suitabl number and combin of base-learn
addit the propos framework doe not requir excess comput resourc to achiev the optim solut
the propos framework is valid use three case studi with diversifi dataset the agricultur domain the audio data analysi domain and the self-gener synthet dataset
the experiment result show the effect of the propos framework .
