bezier-bas explor and hexagon crossov exploit a novel metaheurist approach
this paper present a novel metaheurist algorithm aim at address the ineffici of convent approach that use a singl oper and uniqu popul to handl both explor and exploit
to achiev a more effect search process the algorithm introduc a structur popul that is divid into two distinct group explor xpl and exploit exp . xpl agent perform global explor by follow complex trajectori generat from random select bézier function promot divers and comprehens coverag of the search space
in contrast the exp agent are respons for local refin updat their posit through a special hexagon crossov oper
this oper generat new candid solut within a hexagon-shap region by incorpor inform from other high-qual individu in the popul
by integr these two mechan each dedic to either explor or exploit the algorithm enhanc it abil to focus on promis region while maintain global divers
the propos method was compar with sever state-of-the-art metaheurist use a suit of shift function specif design to challeng center-bias strategi
the experiment result demonstr that the algorithm consist produc a superior solut qualiti and faster converg while effect avoid the typic flaw of center-bias method .
