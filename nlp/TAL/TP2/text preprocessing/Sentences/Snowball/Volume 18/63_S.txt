present a novel hybrid method for dynam economic/emiss dispatch consid renew energi unit and energi storag system
the integr of renew energi sourc ress and energi storag es system into power grid has introduc signific challeng particular in term of econom and environment dispatch
the intermitt natur of ress and uncertainti relat to their output make it difficult for tradit dynam economic/emiss dispatch deed method to ensur optim power generat
the primari goal of deed problem is to effici manag the product of electr energi while satisfi various oper and system constraint such as ramp rate rr limit and the valv point effect vpe
this optim is achiev by minim both the overal fuel cost and emiss of power generat unit
to address these challeng this paper propos a novel hybrid optim approach that incorpor demand respons program drp alongsid es and res to enhanc system flexibl
by leverag drp consum particip in shift or reduc their demand is consid lead to a more balanc and cost-effect dispatch strategi
the propos optim framework employ a hybrid method that combin particl swarm optim pso and modifi shuffl frog leap algorithm msfla to effect solv the deed problem
addit a fuzzy-bas approach is util to achiev a trade-off between econom and environment object ensur an optim balanc between fuel cost reduct and emiss minim
the effect of the propos methodolog is valid on a test system with 10 generat unit over a 24 h period
the numer result indic that compar to convent techniqu such as grasshopp optim go pso shuffl frog leap algorithm sfla and other method report in the literatur the propos strategi achiev signific improv trade-off solut
the incorpor of drp further enhanc the adapt of the system by reduc peak demand and improv cost effici make it a practic and effect solut for real-world power system oper
specif the integr of drp led to a 5% decreas in fuel cost and a 4% declin in emiss compar to case without drp highlight it role in improv both econom effici and environment sustain within the deed framework
the result demonstr that hpso-msfla is a high effect optim techniqu for the deed problem in modern power grid with high level of renew energi sourc and drp
when compar to tradit method like pso and sfla hpso-msfla consist deliv better perform .
