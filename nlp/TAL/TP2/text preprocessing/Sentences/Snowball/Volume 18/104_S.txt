hybrid meta-heurist strategi base on firefli and coyot optim for area coverag enhanc in direct sensor network
direct sensor network dsn util direct sensor with a limit field of view for focus monitor
this direct enhanc energi effici by reduc unnecessari sens and data transmiss
these sensor enabl precis monitor of specif area while minim data redund
optim sensor orient is crucial for maxim area coverag in random deploy network particular in inaccess terrain
effect orient ensur maximum coverag enhanc monitor effici and reduc the need for cost redeploy in challeng environ
this paper propos a novel hybrid firefly-coyot optim algorithm hf-coa to address this problem
a grid-bas mathemat framework is propos to evalu area coverag
the propos hf-coa achiev superior perform in maxim area coverag due to it effect balanc of explor and exploit
experiment result demonstr that hf-coa achiev superior coverag perform compar to standalon fa and coa under vari sensor paramet
the propos method offer a reliabl solut for enhanc monitor effici in complex and dynam environ .
