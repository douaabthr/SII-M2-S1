bird of prey-bas optim bpbo a metaheurist algorithm for optim
optim is a critic challeng across sever engin and scientif disciplin
this paper introduc a uniqu bird of prey-bas optim bpbo algorithm which was influenc by the astut hunt techniqu of predatori bird
the approach util both individu and group hunt techniqu while select target weaker bird to effect balanc explor and exploit strategi
by incorpor a dynam reloc strategi to access more suitabl prey this method enhanc popul divers and mitig the risk of prematur converg
the integr of these strategi in light of the ongo dynam shift enabl the bpbo algorithm to effect address a wide rang of problem
this includ success applic to both small-scal problem with specif constraint and large-scal problem with dimens extend up to 1000
to thorough assess bpbo s effect we conduct an in-depth analysi use 23 optim benchmark of which 13 are design as scalabl
the cec-2014 benchmark function are consid a more complex test set
furthermor bpbo algorithm is util in practic engin design challeng such as optim weld beam three-bar truss gear train cantilev beam and speed reduc
compar analys were conduct util nine and eight algorithm across two set of standard test function
the comparison of the result across all case util robust algorithm substanti the propos algorithm s effect perform in explor the feasibl space of the problem
thorough analys have been conduct to enhanc the understand of the behavior exhibit by the algorithm paramet
