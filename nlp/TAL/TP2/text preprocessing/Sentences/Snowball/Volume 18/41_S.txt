an opposit learn and chaotic local search-bas artifici electr field algorithm for engin optim
metaheurist algorithm are stochast optim techniqu inspir by natur phenomena with their perform driven by two key oper explor and exploit
despit their success a common limit is their suscept to prematur converg and slow progress toward optim solut
to address these challeng this studi present an innov extens of the artifici electr field algorithm aefa a method root in charg system search principl
the propos algorithm incorpor oppositional-bas learn obl and an elit chaotic local search mechan to enhanc both global and local search capabl
obl improv the explor of the global search space while the elit chaotic local search focus on refin solut around near-optim region ensur acceler converg
this hybrid approach is test on cec2020 bound-constrain numer optim problem and real-world applic such as topolog optim and gear train design
the find demonstr the superior of the propos algorithm in term of achiev better optim solut faster converg rate and reduc algorithm complex when compar to exist state-of-the-art algorithm
some notabl perform of the propos algorithm are it demonstr superior perform over all list algorithm for 10d problem f_1 f_2 f_3 f_5 f_7 f_9 f_ 10 and most 20d problem f_1 f_2 f_3 f_5 f_7 f_8 f_9
it show compar result with other algorithm for specif case f_4 f_6 f_8 in both 10d and 20d set consist outperform or match state-of-the-art altern
this highlight oc-aefa s robust and versatil across divers benchmark problem .
