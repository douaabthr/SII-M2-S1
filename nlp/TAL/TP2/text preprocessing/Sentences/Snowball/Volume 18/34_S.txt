synergist optim of predict model for water qualiti analysi in treatment plant use machin learn and evolutionari algorithm
enhanc the assess of water qualiti is essenti for sustain water manag given it critic impact on environment health and human well-b
accur assess present sever difficulti due to the complex and variabl of water ecosystem
among the various machin learn techniqu employ support vector regress and adapt boost have emerg as two of the most wide use and effect method
in recent year mani evolutionari algorithm have been develop to find approxim solut to optim problem
in this studi we investig how effici new algorithm consist of hybrid of machin learn method and evolutionari algorithm can be for some problem
we extens investig support vector regress with various kernel includ linear radial basi function polynomi and sigmoid
in addit we introduc modifi support vector regress and modifi adaboost where standalon ml model are combin with the swarm-bas algorithm such as particl swarm optim limited-memori broyden fletcher goldfarb shanno and distribut evolutionari algorithm in python
we appli the propos hybrid algorithm to the problem of measur water qualiti
accur model and assess of river water qualiti are essenti endeavor with multifacet challeng
we focus on the tigri river model in baghdad governor particular at three water treatment plant eastern tigri al-karkh and al-wathba
the dataset compris multipl water qualiti paramet with a total dissolv solid target
incorpor swarm-bas algorithm into the adopt model has synergist enhanc their predict capabl result in a signific augment of the overal predict prowess of the ml model
the propos hybrid algorithm success enhanc svr model perform with the l-bfgs-b algorithm yield mean squar error reduct of 46.23% and 28.09% on the east tigri and karkh plant respect
in comparison the msvr-pso approach reduc the wathba plant by up to 85.96%
these find have a signific impact on advanc water treatment plant
a thorough understand of these variat is requir when decid on the optim machin learn model for individu applic and general for tigri river water qualiti scale evalu and beyond .
