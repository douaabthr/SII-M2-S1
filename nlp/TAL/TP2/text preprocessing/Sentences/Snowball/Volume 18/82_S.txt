a population-bas variant of the singl candid optim for global optim and multi-level threshold problem in medic imag segment
the skin our bodi s primari defenc is suscept to numer health issu
earli detect and accur diagnosi of such condit reli heavili on medic imag process
multi-level threshold imag segment is a lead techniqu in this field requir an effici optim to achiev optim result
the singl candid optim sco a metaheurist algorithm has shown promis in optim but is limit by it relianc on a singl solut lead to restrict diversif and difficulti escap local optima
to overcom these challeng we introduc a population-bas version of sco term psco
this approach enhanc sco by integr an influenc strategi to guid the popul s swarm behaviour and the invers incomplet gamma function to deepen the intensif phase
in addit a soft strategi is develop to balanc diversif and intensif ensur a smooth transit from global to local search
psco was rigor test on the cec 2022 benchmark suit across 10 and 20 dimens consist outperform sco
furthermor the effect of psco is valid in the context of multi-level threshold imag segment appli to two dataset bsd500 for benchmark and isic for medic imag
the algorithm s perform is evalu use otsu s and kapur s fit function across differ threshold
addit it effect is rigor assess by compar it against ten state-of-the-art solut focus on key metric such as otsu s and kapur s object valu psnr ssim fsim qilv hpsi uiqi and cpu time
the result demonstr signific improv highlight psco s potenti in general optim task and special applic such as medic imag segment .
