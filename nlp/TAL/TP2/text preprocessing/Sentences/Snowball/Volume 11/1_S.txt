editori
i person thank for the great opportun offer to me to act as the guest editor of this special issu which is on natur inspir algorithm and their applic
nature-inspir algorithm nia hasattain immens popularityin recent year for tackl thehard real world np hard and np complet problem and complex optim function for which actual solut doesn t exist
the main purpos behind the develop of such algorithm is to optim engin problem
sinc the world is look toward industri engin problem are becom tedious and tricki to optim
this is becaus of grow dimens time complex variabl space complex and so on
in order tocop up with such situat nature-inspir algorithm are design to optim multi-object function numer benchmark function and solv np-hard problem for more variabl dimens etc
in fact nia is main categor into two evolutionari algorithm and swarm intelligence-bas algorithm
evolutionari algorithm are pure base on the evolutionari behaviour of natur system
these algorithm employ recombin and mutat oper for optim the complex issu e.g. genet algorithm differenti evolut and so on
swarm intellig si base algorithm also term as swarm optim techniqu attempt to optim the engin problem by imit the collect search behaviour of natur swarm
swarm intellig and evolutionari algorithm form a hot topic in the develop of new algorithm inspir by natur
besid these categori nia hasdiffer other classif that are depend tosourc of inspir
for instanc artifici neural network mimic the decision-mak process of human brain
it also gain much attent from the research to solv predict and classif problem .
