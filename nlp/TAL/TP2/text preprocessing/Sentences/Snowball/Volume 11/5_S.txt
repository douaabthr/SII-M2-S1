medic imag secur enhanc use two dimension chaotic map optim by self-adapt grey wolf algorithm
the develop of encrypt and decrypt play a vital role in the field of secur
recent chaos-bas secur has suggest the reliabl and effici way of secur the imag
in this paper self-adapt grey wolf optim gwo is propos for optim 2 dimension logist chaotic map 2dcm
further the secur analysi of the propos method is perform use differ comparison such as key sensit histogram analysi adjac pixel autocorrel inform entropi attack qualiti of encrypt chi squar test etc
moreov analyt outcom are compar with the convent algorithm like standard encrypt and decrypt genet algorithm ga and gwo
the experiment result state that the propos method is key sensit and oppos to the general attack dure the encrypt and decrypt of imag .
