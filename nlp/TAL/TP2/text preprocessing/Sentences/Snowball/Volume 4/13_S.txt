paramet control of metaheurist with genet fuzzi system
this paper introduc a genet fuzzi system for paramet control of metaheurist
two basic metaheurist have been consid as exampl genet algorithm and tabu search
the control paramet of the tabu search are the short and long term memori
paramet of the genet algorithm under control are the mutat and reproduct rate
fuzzi rule-bas model offer a natur mechan to describ global behavior as a combin of control rule
they also inherit a mean to gradual shift between control rule which joint defin a control strategi
they are a natur candid to construct paramet control strategi becaus they provid a way to develop decis mechan base on the specif natur of search region and transit between their boundari
an applic exampl use the classic vehicl rout problem with time window is includ to evalu the genet fuzzi system perform
experiment result show that gfs-control metaheurist improv search behavior and solut qualiti when compar against standard constant paramet genet and tabu search approach
it also provid reason good suboptim solut faster than special tailor exact method report in the literatur .
