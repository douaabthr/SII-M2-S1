learn classifi system to evolv classif rule for system of memori constrain compon
in this paper we studi how to solv classif problem in comput system that consist of distribut memori constrain compon
interact pittsburgh-styl learn classifi system are use to generat set of classif rule that can be deploy on the compon
we show that this approach distribut the knowledg and enabl the compon to solv complex classif problem in cooper
we studi the structur and properti of the evolv rule set and analys the way the compon share their knowledg
moreov we investig the influenc of differ communic topolog and the introduct of communic cost on the emerg pattern of cooper and on the classif perform of the whole system .
