surrogate-assist clonal select algorithm for expens optim problem
clonal select algorithm are comput method inspir by the behavior of the immun system which can be appli to solv optim problem
howev like other natur inspir algorithm they can requir a larg number of object function evalu in order to reach a satisfactori solut
when those evalu involv a comput expens simul model their cost becom prohibit
in this paper we analyz the use of surrog model in order to enhanc the perform of a clonal select algorithm
comput experi are conduct to assess the perform of the present techniqu use a benchmark with 22 test-problem under a fix budget of object function evalu
the comparison show that for most case the use of surrog model improv signific the perform of the baselin clonal select algorithm .
