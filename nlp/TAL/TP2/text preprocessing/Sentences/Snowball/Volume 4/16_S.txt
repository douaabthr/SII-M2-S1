evolutionari comput as an artifici attack generat evas attack for detector vulner test
intrus detect system protect our infrastructur by monitor for sign of intrus
howev intrus detect system are themselv suscept to vulner which the attack take advantag of to evad detect
in particular we focus on evas attack in which the attack aim to generat a stealthi attack that elimin or minim the likelihood of detect
attack achiev stealth by mimick normal behaviour while achiev the attack goal henc bypass the detector
previous work focus on generat evas attack use the intern knowledg of the detector henc adopt a white-box access to the detector
on the other hand we adopt a black-box approach and propos an evolutionari attack base on genet program
the access of our black-box approach is limit to the feedback of the detector such as anomali rate and delay
we compar our black-box approach with various white-box approach to investig it effect
in do so the impact of anomali from the break-in stage of the attack and the delay base on local frame count are also discuss
this is particular import if the perform comparison is to reflect the real capabl of detector .
