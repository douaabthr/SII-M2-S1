neuroevolutionari reinforc learn for general control of simul helicopt
this articl present an extend case studi in the applic of neuroevolut to general simul helicopt hover an import challeng problem for reinforc learn
while neuroevolut is well suit to cope with the domain s complex transit dynam and high-dimension state and action space the need to explor effici and learn on-lin pose unusu challeng
we propos and evalu sever method for three increas challeng variat of the task includ the method that won first place in the 2008 reinforc learn competit
the result demonstr that 1 neuroevolut can be effect for complex on-lin reinforc learn task such as general helicopt hover 2 neuroevolut excel at find effect helicopt hover polici but not at learn helicopt model 3 due to the difficulti of learn reliabl model model-bas approach to helicopt hover are feasibl onli when domain expertis is avail to aid the design of a suitabl model represent and 4 recent advanc in effici resampl can enabl neuroevolut to tackl more aggress general reinforc learn task .
