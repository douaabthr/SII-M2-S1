novel evolutionari algorithm for supervis classif problem an experiment studi
evolutionari algorithm ea are population-bas stochast search algorithm that mimic natur evolut
over the year ea have been success appli to mani classif problem
in this paper we present three novel evolutionari approach and analyz their perform for synthes classifi with ea in supervis data mine scenario
the first approach is base on encod rule set with bit string genom while the second one util genet program gp to creat decis tree with arbitrari express attach to the node
the novelti of these two approach lie in the use of solut on the pareto front as an ensembl
the third approach eddie-101 is also base on gp but use a new advanc fit measur and some novel genet oper
we compar these approach to a number of well-known data mine method includ c4 . 5 and random-forest and show that the perform of our evolv classifi can be veri competit as far as the solut qualiti is concern
in addit the propos approach work well across a wide rang of configur and eddie-101 particular has been high effici
to further evalu the flexibl of eddie-101 across differ problem domain we also test it on some real financi dataset for find invest opportun and compar the result with those obtain use other classifi
numer experi confirm that eddie-101 can be success extend to financi forecast .
