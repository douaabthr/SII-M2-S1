on the role of age divers for effect age oper
age is a general mechan that some random search heurist employ to increas the divers of their collect of search point
a more divers collect of search point is believ to improv the search heurist s perform for difficult problem
the most promin random search heurist with age are evolutionari algorithm and artifici immun system
while it is known that random search heurist with age can be veri much more effici than random search heurist without age the detail of the origin of such benefit are difficult to understand
we contribut to this understand by present a detail and structur analysi of age
we prove that in addit to divers with respect to search point divers with respect to age play a key role
we analyz differ way of deal with age divers by mean of theoret as well as empir analys
major result includ a more structur understand of age and showcas where age divers can make the differ between effici and complet ineffici optim .
