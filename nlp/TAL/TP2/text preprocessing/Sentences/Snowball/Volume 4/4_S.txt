a hybrid harmoni search algorithm for mri brain segment
automat magnet reson imag mri brain segment is a challeng problem that has receiv signific attent in the field of medic imag process
in this paper we present a new dynam cluster algorithm base on the hybrid of harmoni search hs and fuzzi c-mean to automat segment mri brain imag in an intellig manner
in our algorithm the capabl of standard hs is modifi to automat evolv the appropri number of cluster as well as the locat of cluster center
by incorpor the concept of variabl length encod in each harmoni memori vector this algorithm is abl to repres variabl number of candid cluster center at each iter
a new hs oper call the empti oper has been introduc to support the select of empti decis variabl in the harmoni memori vector
the pbmf cluster valid index is use as an object function to valid the cluster result obtain from each harmoni memori vector
evalu of the propos algorithm has been perform use both real mri data obtain from the center for morphometr analysi at massachusett general hospit and simul mri data generat use the mcgill univers brainweb mri simul
experiment result show the abil of this algorithm to find the appropri number of natur occur region in brain imag
furthermor the superior of the propos algorithm over various state-of-the-art segment algorithm is demonstr quantit .
