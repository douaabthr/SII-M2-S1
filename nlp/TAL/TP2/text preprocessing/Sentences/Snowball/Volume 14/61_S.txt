supervis machin learn approach to predict qualit softwar product
softwar develop process sdp is a framework impos on softwar product develop and is a multi-stag process wherein a wide rang of task and activ pan out in each stage
each stage requir care observ to improv product qualiti etc
to eas the process of develop
dure each stage problem surfac like constraint of on-tim complet proper util of avail resourc and appropri traceabl of work progress etc
and may lead to reiter due to the defect spot dure test and then result into the negat walk-through due to unsatisfactori outcom
work on such defect can help to take a step toward the proper steer of activ and thus to improv the expect perform of the softwar product
handpick the proper notabl featur of sdp and then analyz their natur toward the outcom can great help in get a reliabl softwar product by meet the expect object
this paper propos supervis machin learn ml model for the predict of better sdp particular focus on cost estim defect predict and reusabl
the experiment studi were conduct on the primari data and the evalu reveal the model suitabl in term of effici and effect for sdp predict accuraci of cost estim 65% defect predict 93% and reusabl 82% .
