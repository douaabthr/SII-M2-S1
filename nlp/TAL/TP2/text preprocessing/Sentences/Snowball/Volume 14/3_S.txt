modifi crash-minim path design approach for autonom materi handl robot
the potenti of particl swarm optim pso artifici potenti field apf and improv pso ipso approach are exploit in this paper for design and generat the best possibl optimum trajectori for a mobil materi handl robot
the paper has an aim to develop a robot which use to creat a bridg between primari and secondari handl system
this princip save the transport time so the total cycl time and manufactur lead time can be reduc
for perform simul practic two practic surround has been develop with a layout of institut machin shop and advanc laboratori
object of this studi are to slash the track size comput time degre of crash risk travel time and better path smooth
to check the robust and applic of the approach a comparison report has been prepar among their simul and experiment outcom
for surround setup-i pso algorithm provid 35.3568 m track length 20.778 s comput time and 280.098 s travel time
similar the trajectori dimens comput time and travel time generat in apf approach is 44.1632 m 10.923 s and 343.441 s respect
33.6278 m track size 20.651 s comput time and 266.612 s travel time is develop by ipso approach
for surround setup-ii pso algorithm provid 14.7769 m track length 18.655 s comput time and 117.063 s travel time
similar the trajectori dimens comput time and travel time generat in apf approach is 22.8645 m 27.623 s and 189.077 s respect
13.0859 m track size 18.507 s comput time and 103.769 s travel time is develop by ipso approach
from comparison studi it is found that ipso approach deliv smoother less collis risk associ path have less length and comput time irrespect to environ complex
the approach are reli on comput program command which are written compil and run use matlab softwar .
