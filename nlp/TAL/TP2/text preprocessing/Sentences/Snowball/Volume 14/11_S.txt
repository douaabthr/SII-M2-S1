a novel stack spars denois autoencod for mammographi restor to visual interpret of breast lesion
this paper propos a deep unsupervis learn base denois autoencod model for the restor of degrad mammogram with visual interpret of breast lump or lesion in mammographi imag call ssdae
the propos model attempt to intensifi the underexpos and abnorm structur region through nois elimin in mammographi imag
a deep stack convolut autoencod is design by combin the autoencod and the deconvolut network which conjoint reduc noisi artifact and improv imag detail in mammogram
the propos ssdae model take larg noisi mammogram imag patch as input and extract relev featur from target batch
the suggest model can extract relev featur and reduc the dimension through sparsiti properti of the imag data while preserv the key featur that have been appli to restor imag data in featur space
in order to reconstruct a deafen mammogram the propos model is carri out through a patch base train on sampl to suppress nois therebi preserv structur detail in mammographi imag
experiment result authent that the suggest ssdae model outplay a number of state-of-the-art method for both x-ray mammogram and ultrasonograph mammogram
the execut speed for target noisi imag increas with fine tune of the network when compar to other algorithm .
