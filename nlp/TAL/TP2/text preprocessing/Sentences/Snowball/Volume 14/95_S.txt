investig the use of an ensembl of evolutionari algorithm for letter identif in tremul mediev handwrit
ensembl classifi are known for perform good general from simpler and less accur classifi
ensembl have the abil to use the varieti in classif pattern of the smaller classifi in order to make better predict
howev to creat an ensembl it is necessari to determin how the compon classifi should be combin to generat the final predict
one way to do this is to search differ combin of classifi with evolutionari algorithm which are larg employ when the object is to find a structur that serv for some purpos
in this work an investig is carri about the use of ensembl obtain via evolutionari algorithm for identifi individu letter in tremul mediev write and to differenti between scribe
the aim of this research is to use this process as the first step toward classifi the tremor type with more accuraci
the ensembl are obtain through evolutionari search of tree that aggreg the output of base classifi which are neural network train prior to the ensembl search
the misclassif pattern of the base classifi are analys in order to determin how much better an ensembl of those classifi can be than it compon
the best ensembl have their misclassif pattern compar to those of their compon classifi
the result obtain suggest interest method for letter up to 96% accuraci and user classif up to 88% accuraci in an offlin scenario .
