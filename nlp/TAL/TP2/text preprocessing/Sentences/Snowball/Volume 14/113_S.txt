sos 2.0 an evolutionari approach for sos algorithm
with the shortcom on the solut given for most-rec optim problem decision-mak from differ field yearn the exist of tenaci breakthrough
in fact they all share the same oblig to optim work effici whether to minim cost consumpt or to maxim the profit acquir
metaheurist search is the more-advanc method proven to be use for difficult optim task
moreov develop record also signal rapid develop of these algorithm contribut sever notabl and power optim algorithm
among them symbiot organ search sos receiv notic attent due to it simplic and also it parameter-less natur
nonetheless sever consider issu are still challeng for further develop
for instanc local optima and prematur converg issu found from ani improp and ineffici comput procedur on higher dimension problem
also exploit and explor trade-off is anoth essenti issu involv stabil for optim perform
in that case this work propos a new evolutionari approach name sos 2.0
there are two distinct featur associ with the evolut self-parameter-upd spu techniqu and chaotic map sequenc
both featur are integr for a better balanc of explor and exploit in which spu focus on explor and chaotic map focus on exploit instead
this work also appli benchmark function test and engin design optim problem in advanc for valid purpos of the perform
the experiment result show that sos 2.0 deliv not onli better perform from it predecessor and also sever recent sos modif which can be conclud as one success approach for better sos algorithm but also enhanc the comput effici and capabl of search optim solut .
