an effici nuclei segment method base on roulett wheel whale optim and fuzzi cluster
imag segment is a techniqu in which an imag is partit into differ categori or region that correspond to object or part of object
the perform of segment method is general reduc for the hematoxylin and eosin stain histopatholog imag due to complex background and vari intens valu
therefor in this paper the roulett wheel select whale optim base fuzzi cluster method is introduc for the nuclei segment of histopatholog imag
the propos cluster method find the optim cluster use the object function that reduc the sum of squar error or compact
the perform of the propos cluster method has been examin on the histopatholog imag dataset of triple-neg breast cancer patient and compar with k-mean and fuzzi c-mean in respect of f1 score and aggreg jaccard index
the propos method attain 0.6701 mean f1 score and 0.7387 mean aggreg jaccard index valu which are the best valu among other method
the experiment outcom valid the effici of the introduc method over the other clustering-bas segment method .
