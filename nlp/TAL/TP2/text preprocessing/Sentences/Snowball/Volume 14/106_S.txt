massiv mimo perspect improv sea lion for optim antenna select
the massiv mimo is an advanc technolog in the wideband wireless communic system s futur which provok extens attent in both academia and telecommun industri
pilot contamin is consid as a fundament issu in the system of massiv mimo
the design of wireless system has the main concern over the system throughput
though the environment protect and energy-sav have concern as inevit trend and global demand
henc on consid all these consequ this paper intend to introduc a new improv sea lion optim algorithm to select the optim transmit antenna select by account the multi-object issu that maxim both the relat energi effici and capac
in fact the propos algorithm is the enhanc version of tradit sea lion optim algorithm which optim tune the count of transmit antenna and determin which antenna to be select
final the perform of propos work is compar and prove over other convent model regard capac analysi relat effici analysi and optim antenna select analysi as well .
