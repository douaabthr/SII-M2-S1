the hub locat s method for solv optim control problem
in this paper the p-hub median s algorithm is modifi to find an approxim solut of bound continuous-tim nonlinear optim control problem nocp
for this purpos after present the similar between uncapacit singl alloc p-hub median problem usaphmp which is a special case of the well-studi hub locat problem and a discret form of nocp an improv on sequenti general variabl neighborhood search algorithm sgvns is propos
this algorithm that denot as new-sequenti general variabl neighborhood search n-sgvns is base on three local search that use effici neighborhood interchang
in addit compar the nocp with the usaphmp has led us to introduc a suitabl method to find an approxim solut for nocp
our result of the implement of the n-sgvns on the real-world data set for the usaphmp show the high accuraci of the obtain solut
becaus of the propos algorithm is abl to solv the usaphmp success we hope that this method would also be success for nocp
solv of benchmark nocp and then compar the result of the n-sgvns with recent develop algorithm suggest that the present strategi may provid an outstand framework for design cost-effect control function .
