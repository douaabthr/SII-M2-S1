neighborhood centroid opposite-bas learn harri hawk optim for train neural network
the harri hawk optim algorithm is a new metaheurist optim that simul the process of harri hawk hunt prey rabbit in natur
the global and local search process of the algorithm are perform by simul sever stage of cooper behavior dure hunt
to enhanc the perform of this algorithm in this paper we propos a neighborhood centroid opposite-bas learn harri hawk optim algorithm ncohho
the mechan of appli the neighborhood centroid under the premis of use opposite-bas learn technolog to improv the perform of the algorithm the neighborhood centroid is use as a refer point for the generat of the opposit particl while maintain the divers of the popul and make full use of the swarm search experi to expand the search rang of the revers solut
enhanc the probabl of find the optim solut and the improv algorithm is superior to the origin harri hawk optim algorithm in all aspect
we appli ncohho to the train of feed-forward neural network fnn
to confirm that use ncohho to train fnn is more effect five classif dataset are appli to benchmark the perform of the propos method
comprehens comparison and analysi from the three aspect of mean varianc and classif success rate the experiment result show that the propos ncohho algorithm for optim fnn has the best comprehens perform and has more outstand perform than other metaheurist algorithm in term of the perform measur .
