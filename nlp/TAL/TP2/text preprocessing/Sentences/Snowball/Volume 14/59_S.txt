an effici approach for sentiment analysi use machin learn algorithm
sentiment analysi determin the view of the user from the social media
it is use to classifi the content of the text into neutral negat and posit class
various research have use differ method to train and classifi twitter dataset with differ result
particular when time is taken as constraint in some applic like airlin and sale the algorithm play a major role
in this paper an optim base machin learn algorithm is propos to classifi the twitter data
the process was done in three stage
in the first stage data is collect and preprocess in the second stage the data is optim by extract necessari featur and in the third stage the updat train set is classifi into differ class by appli differ machin learn algorithm
each algorithm give differ result
it is observ that the propos method i.e. sequenti minim optim with decis tree give good accuraci of 89.47% compar to other machin learn algorithm .
