threshold estim from softwar metric by use evolutionari techniqu and it propos algorithm model
the softwar metric play the import role in the softwar industri
as the softwar industri grow in size and complex enhanc support is mandatori for comput and manag the softwar qualiti
qualiti measur is one of the key featur of the manag in the softwar industri where threshold play the crucial role
softwar measur is necessari by mean for evalu differ qualiti attribut and characterist such as size complex maintain and usabl
instead of that effect and effici softwar system is straightforward depend on the mean of suitabl threshold
the object of this paper is to estim the threshold valu from softwar metric by use novel evolutionari intellig techniqu
the threshold and age softwar design optim algorithm and model to prevent softwar age by use machin learn evolutionari algorithm
apart from the above-ment techniqu this paper also propos a novel threshold estim age and surviv awar sensit reusabl optim model of an object-ori softwar system
to expand firm age and surviv awar sensit optim threshold scheme age predict and softwar rejuven model and algorithm propos .
