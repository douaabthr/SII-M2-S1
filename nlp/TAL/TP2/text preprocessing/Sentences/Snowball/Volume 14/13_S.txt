hyper-paramet tune deep q network for area estim of oil spill a meta-heurist approach
oil spill near shorelin are a major environment hazard
rapid estim of spill perimet provid a quick estim of it area extent thus facilit it quick remov
in this studi a meta-heurist algorithm gamma-levi hybrid meta-heurist with condit evolut glhm-ce is propos
the propos algorithm is then use to evolv a distribut control strategi for a swarm of unman aerial vehicl for rapid confin and estim of spill perimet
everi agent is control by a deep q network whose hyper-paramet are tune by glhm-ce
evalu of glhm-ce over 28 blackbox problem of cec-2013 special session on real-paramet optim and it comparison with evolutionari algorithm like shade co-d and jade reveal that glhm-ce success evad local minima and has a fast converg
the effect in hyper-paramet tune of a deep q network by glhm-ce was evalu over the quintessenti cartpol problem from openai gym framework .
