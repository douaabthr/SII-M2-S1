uid a unifi intrus detect system for iot environ
intrus detect system id use machin learn approach is get popular as it has an advantag of get updat by itself to defend against ani new type of attack
anoth emerg technolog call internet of thing iot is take the respons to make autom system by communic the devic without human intervent
in iot base system the wireless communic between sever devic through the internet caus vulner for differ secur threat
this paper propos a novel unifi intrus detect system for iot environ uid to defend the network from four type of attack such as exploit dos probe and generic
the system is also abl to detect normal categori of network traffic
most of the relat work on id are base on kdd99 or nsl-kdd 99 data set which are unabl to detect new type of attack
in this paper unsw-nb15 data set is consid as the benchmark dataset to design uid for detect malici activ in the network
the perform analysi prove that the attack detect rate of the propos model is higher compar to two exist approach enad and dendron which also work on unsw-nb15 data set .
