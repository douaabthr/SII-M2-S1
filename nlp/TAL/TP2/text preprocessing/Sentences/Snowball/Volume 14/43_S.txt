a work load predict strategi for power optim on cloud base data centr use deep machin learn
the applic develop industri has move into cloud comput for stratifi the need of the custom for higher avail and higher scalabl
the cloud comput environ provid the infrastructur off the premis for the applic owner which reduc the need for cost and secur aspect
the primari intens of the cloud-bas data centr is to virtual the infrastructur for the applic and present it as infrastructur as a servic iaa
the deploy of the applic from the applic owner is done on the data centr and must be alloc to ani of the pre-configur instanc
the instanc are again configur with virtual machin for virtual the comput capabl memori capabl network bandwidth capabl and final the storag capabl
the deploy applic on the virtual machin must be access by the applic consum or the client of the applic owner
load balanc typic includ commit program or equip for exampl a multilay switch or a domain name system server process
onc the load is balanc then the applic perform can be justifi
great number of research endeavor have endeavor to build the present of the applic dure load balanc by send differ calcul for distinguish proof of the load virtual machin and less load case for determin of the goal server
nevertheless the perform of these strategi for load balanc is alway critic by various research attempt for be high time complex and direct effect the overal perform
extraordinari number of research tri have attempt to construct the introduct of the applic dure load balanc by send various estim for recogn verif of the load virtual machin and less load case for assur of the object server
the outcom from this research is high satisfactori and demonstr near 98% accuraci on the load predict and near 85% reduct on the time complex with 88% reduct on the sla violat .
