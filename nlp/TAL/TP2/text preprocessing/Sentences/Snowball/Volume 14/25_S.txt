particl swarm optim with adapt inertia weight base on cumul binomi probabl
particl swarm optim pso is a popul orient heurist numer optim algorithm influenc by the combin behavior of some bird
sinc it introduct in 1995 a larg number of variant of pso algorithm have been introduc that improv it perform
the perform of the algorithm most reli upon inertia weight and optim paramet set
inertia weight bring equival among exploit and explor while search optim solut within the search region
this paper present a new improv version of pso that use adapt inertia weight techniqu which is base on cumul binomi probabl cbppso
the propos approach along with four other pso variant are test over a set of ten well-known optim test problem
the result confirm that the perform of propos algorithm cbppso is better than other pso variant in most of the case
also the propos algorithm has been evalu on three real-world engin problem and the result obtain are promis .
