an imag segment method use logarithmickbestgravit search algorithm base superpixel cluster
imag segment partit an imag into coher and non-overlap region
due to variat of visual pattern in imag it is a challeng problem
this paper introduc a new superpixel-bas cluster method to effici perform the imag segment
in the propos method initi superpixel from an imag are obtain
the superpixel are further cluster into the requir number of region by a newli propos variant of gravit search algorithm name logarithmickbestgravit search algorithm
experi are conduct on the berkeley segment dataset and benchmark bsds500
it is affirm from both visual and numer analys that the propos method is efficaci and accur in segment an imag than the other consid segment method .
