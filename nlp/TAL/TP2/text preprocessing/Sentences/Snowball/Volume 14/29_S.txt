delug base genet algorithm for featur select
featur select method are use to identifi and remov irrelev and redund attribut from the origin featur vector that do not have much contribut to enhanc the perform of a predict model
meta-heurist featur select algorithm use as a solut to this problem need to have a good trade-off between exploit and explor of the search space
genet algorithm ga a popular meta-heurist algorithm lack exploit capabl which in turn affect the local search abil of the algorithm
basic ga use mutat oper to take care of exploit which has certain limit
as a result ga get stuck in local optima
to encount this problem in the present work we have intellig blend the great delug algorithm gda a local search algorithm with ga
here gda is use in place of mutat oper of the ga
applic of gda yield a high degre of exploit through the use of perturb of candid solut
the propos method is name as delug base genet algorithm dga
we have appli the dga on 15 public avail standard dataset taken from the uci dataset repositori
to show the classifi independ natur of the propos featur select method we have use 3 differ classifi name k-nearest neighbour knn multi-lay perceptron mlp and support vector machin svm
comparison of dga has been perform with other contemporari algorithm like the basic version of ga particl swarm optimis pso simul anneal sa and histogram base multi-object ga hmoga
from the comparison result it has been observ that dga perform much better than other in most of the case
thus our main contribut in this paper are introduct of a new variant of ga for fs which use gda to strengthen it exploit abil and applic of the propos method on 15 well-known uci dataset use knn mlp and svm classifi .
