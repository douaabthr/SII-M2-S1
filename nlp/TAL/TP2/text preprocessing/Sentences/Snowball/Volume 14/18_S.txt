mesh smooth of complex geometri use variat of cohort intellig algorithm
sever approach includ optim base method were develop for mesh qualiti improv use onli node movement keep intact the element connect
in this research a socio-inspir optim approach refer to as cohort intellig ci was investig for mesh smooth
minim of summat of condit number of all element was the final aim
the geometr boundari of the object defin the surfac and edg constraint for movement of extern node
movement of intern node was complet govern by variat of ci algorithm viz
roulett wheel follow best follow better alien and random select follow worst and follow itself
the approach was demonstr with pentagon prism hexagon prism and hexagon prism with hole
the perform of follow best and roulett wheel variat of ci algorithm was observ to be satisfactori as compar to other variat of the algorithm .
