on accur local of sensor node in underwat sensor network a doppler shift and modifi genet algorithm base local techniqu
the problem of local in under water sensor node has led to propos of mani techniqu over the past few decad that depend primarili on time of arriv and time differ of arriv
while these techniqu are intuit veri appeal and easi to deploy accur node local in dynam under water environ has remain elus
sensor node deploy underwat tend to move from their origin posit due to water current and henc their exact posit at a given moment of time are not known with precis
due to inher drawback of radio signal propag in underwat environ local of sensor node depend on acoust signal
in this paper we propos a doppler shift base local follow by a genet algorithm base optim techniqu that improv accuraci in local unknown node in underwat sensor network
the propos techniqu envisag sink node play a pivot role in take over a bulk of the comput load on account of be compar more access and servic as compar to ani other node in the network that are deploy underwat
the algorithm reli on observ frequenc shift doppler shift of sound wave compar to actual that happen when sourc and observ are mobil as they do in a marin environ
while doppler shift determin the approxim locat of an unknown sensor node genet algorithm minim the error in local
our propos methodolog has much lower local error as compar to exist protocol .
