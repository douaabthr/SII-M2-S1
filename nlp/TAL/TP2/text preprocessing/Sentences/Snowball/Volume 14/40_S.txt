data augment for cancer classif in oncogenom an improv knn base approach
there is current a great need for research in gene express data to help with cancer classif in the field of oncogenom
this is especi true sinc the diseas occur sporad and often doe not show symptom
typic gene express data is disproportion with a larg number of featur and a low number of sampl
a small sampl size is like to advers affect accuraci of classif as the perform of a classifi depend larg on the data
there is a press need to generat data which could be provid as better input to classifi
primit augment techniqu like uniform random generat and addit of nois do not assur good probabl distribut
second as we deal with critic applic the augment data need to have greater likelihood to the origin valu
thus we propos an improv variant of k-nearest neighborhood knn rule
we use count quotient filter euclidean distanc and mean best valu from the k-neighbor for each target sampl to get synthet sampl
a comparison is drawn amongst the raw data from public domain origin data data generat use standard k-nearest neighbor rule and data generat use improv k-nearest neighbor rule
the data generat through these approach is then further classifi use state-of-art classifi like svm j48 and dnn
the sampl generat through our improvis techniqu yield better recal valu than the standard implement ensur sensit of data
averag classif accuraci from all the three classifi conclud enhanc of 7.72% as compar to tradit knn approach and 16% when raw data is consid as input to the classifi
thus the propos algorithm attain two object first ensur sensit of data for critic applic and second enhanc classif accuraci .
