enhanc cartesian genet program through preferenti select of larger solut
we demonstr how the effici of cartesian genet program method can be enhanc through the preferenti select of phenotyp larger solut among equal good solut
the advantag is demonstr in two qualit differ problem the eight-bit pariti problem and the paig regress problem
in both case the preferenti select of larger solut provid an advantag in term of the perform and of speed i. e
number of evalu requir to evolv optim or high-qual solut
perform can be further enhanc by self-adapt the mutat rate through the one-fifth success rule
final we demonstr that for problem like the paig regress in which neutral play a smaller role perform can be further improv by preferenti select larger solut also among candid with similar fit .
