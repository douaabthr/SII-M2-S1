giza pyramid construct an ancient-inspir metaheurist algorithm for optim
nowaday mani optim issu around us cannot be solv by precis method or that cannot be solv in a reason time
one way to solv such problem is to use metaheurist algorithm
metaheurist algorithm tri to find the best solut out of all possibl solut in the shortest time possibl
speed in converg accuraci and problem-solv abil at high dimens are characterist of a good metaheurist algorithm
this paper present a new population-bas metaheurist algorithm inspir by a new sourc of inspir
this algorithm is call giza pyramid construct gpc inspir by the ancient past has the characterist of a good metaheurist algorithm to deal with mani issu
the ancient-inspir is to observ and reflect on the legaci of the ancient past to understand the optim method technolog and strategi of that era
the propos algorithm is control by the movement of the worker and push the stone block on the ramp
this algorithm is compar with five standard and popular metaheurist algorithm
for this purpos thirti differ and divers benchmark test function are util
the propos algorithm is also test on high-dimension benchmark test function and is use as an applic in imag segment
the result show that the propos algorithm is better than other metaheurist algorithm and it is success in solv high-dimension problem especi imag segment .
