self-adapt learn for hybrid genet algorithm
local search can be introduc into genet algorithm to creat a hybrid but ani improv in perform is depend on the learn mechan
in the lamarckian model a candid solut is replac by a fitter neighbour if one is found by local search
in the baldwinian model the origin solut is retain but with an upgrad fit if a fitter solut is found in the local search space
the effect of use either model or a variabl proport of the two within a hybrid genet algorithm is affect by the topolog of the fit function and the detail of the hybrid algorithm
this paper investig an intellig adapt approach to decid on the learn mechan to be use by an individu over the cours of the search
evolut is use to self-adapt both the frequenc of a steepest-desc local search and the relat proport of lamarckian and baldwinian inherit
experi have shown that this form of adapt learn can improv the abil to find high-qual solut and can acceler the hybrid search without the need to find optim control paramet for the learn process .
