gsapso-mqc medic imag encrypt base on genet simul anneal particl swarm optim and modifi quantum chao system
due to the larg amount of imag inform data high redund and high pixel correl the tradit medic imag encrypt algorithm is easi to be attack by chosen plaintext
therefor a new medic imag encrypt algorithm combin genet simul anneal particl swarm optim and modifi quantum chao system is propos to obtain better secur perform
first an improv quantum chaotic system is use to generat the key stream
then the select and cross oper of genet algorithm are use to process the plaintext imag
the optim sequenc generat by simul anneal algorithm is use to scrambl the imag
meanwhil the particl swarm optim pso algorithm is introduc into the simul anneal mechan
the initi temperatur is set accord to the optim fit valu of the initi popul
metropoli is use to optim the generat of individu optim posit and global optim posit and the inerti weight paramet of pso algorithm are optim to avoid particl fall into local optim in the optim process and improv the converg speed of the algorithm
through these three oper the histogram of the scrambl imag can be equal to resist statist attack
experiment result and perform analysi show that the encrypt system propos in this paper can resist mani typic attack such as histogram analysi correl analysi differenti attack and violent attack and has high secur and encrypt effici
compar with other encrypt method the encrypt effici of our propos method has improv by approxim 10% .
