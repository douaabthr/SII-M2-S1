hybrid particl swarm optim with particl elimin for the high school timet problem
in this paper a pso-bas algorithm that hybrid particl swarm optim pso and hill climb hc is appli to high school timet problem
this hybrid has two featur a novel solut transform and particl elimin
the propos methodolog are test on the xhstt-2014 dataset which is relat new for the school timet problem plus other addit instanc
the experiment result show that the propos algorithm is effect in solv small and medium instanc compar to standalon hc and better than the convent pso for most instanc
in a comparison to the state of the art method it achiev the lowest mean of soft constraint violat for 7 instanc and the lowest mean of hard constraint violat for 1 instanc .
