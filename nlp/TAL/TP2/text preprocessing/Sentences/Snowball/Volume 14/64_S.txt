fpa clust evalu of the flower pollin algorithm for data cluster
in this work a standalon approach base on the flower pollin algorithm fpa is propos for solv data cluster problem
the fpa is a nature-inspir algorithm simul the behavior of flower pollin
the propos approach is use to extract key inform in term of optim cluster center that are deriv from train sampl of the select databas
these extract cluster center are then valid on test sampl
three dataset from the uci machin learn data repositori and an addit multi-spectr real-tim satellit imag are chosen to illustr the effect and divers of the propos techniqu
the fpa perform is compar with the k-mean a popular cluster algorithm and metaheurist algorithm name the genet algorithm particl swarm optim cuckoo search spider monkey optim grey wolf optim differenti evolut harmoni search and bat algorithm
the result are evalu base on classif error percentag cep time complex and statist signific
fpa has the lowest cep for all four dataset and an averag cep of 28% which is 5.5% lower than next best algorithm in that sens
the fpa is the second quickest algorithm to converg after hs algorithm
fpa also show a higher level of statist signific
therefor the obtain result show that the fpa effici cluster the data and perform better than the state-of-the-art method .
