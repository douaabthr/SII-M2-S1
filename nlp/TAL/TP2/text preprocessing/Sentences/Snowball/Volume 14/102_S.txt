artifici intellig and game theori control autonom uav swarm
autonom unman aerial vehicl uav oper as a swarm can be deploy in auster environ where cyber electromagnet activ often requir speedi and dynam adjust to swarm oper
use of central control uavsynchron mechan or pre-plan set of action to control a swarm in such deploy would hinder it abil to deliv expect servic
we introduc artifici intellig and game theori base flight control algorithm to be run by each autonomousuavto determin it action in near real-tim while reli onli on local spatial tempor and electromagnet em inform
eachuavus our flight control algorithm posit itself such that the swarm maintain mobil ad-hoc network manet connect and uniform asset distribut over an area of interest
typic task for swarm use our algorithm includ detect local and track of mobileemtransmitt
we present a formal analysi show that our algorithm can guid a swarm to maintain a connectedmanet promot a uniform network spread while avoid overcrowd with other swarm member
we also prove that they maintainmanetconnect and at the same time they can lead a swarm of autonomousuav to follow or avoid anemtransmitt
simul experi inopnetmodel verifi the result of formal analysi that our algorithm are capabl of provid an adequ area coverag over a mobileemsourc and maintainmanetconnect
these algorithm are good candid for civilian and militari applic that requir agil respons to the chang in dynam environ for task such as detect local and track mobileemtransmitt .
