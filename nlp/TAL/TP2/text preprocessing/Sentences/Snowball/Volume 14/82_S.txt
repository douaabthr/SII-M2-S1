optim featur selection-bas diabet retinopathi detect use improv rider optim algorithm enabl with deep learn
this propos tempt to develop autom dr detect by analyz the retin abnorm like hard exud haemorrhag microaneurysm and soft exud
the main process phase of the develop dr detect model is pre-process optic disk remov blood vessel remov segment of abnorm featur extract optim featur select and classif
at first the pre-process of the input retin imag is done by contrast limit adapt histogram equal
the next phase perform the optic disc remov which is carri out by open-clos watersh transform
further the grey level threshold is done for segment the blood vessel and it remov
onc the optic disk and blood vessel are remov segment of abnorm is done by top hat transform and gabor filter
further the featur extract phase is start which tend to extract four set of featur like local binari pattern textur energi measur shanon s and kapur s entropi
sinc the length of the featur vector seem to be long the featur select process is done which select the uniqu featur with less correl
moreov the deep belief network dbn base classif algorithm perform the categor of imag into four class normal earlier moder or sever stage
the optim featur select is done by the improv meta-heurist algorithm call modifi gear and steering-bas rider optim algorithm mgs-roa and the same algorithm updat the weight in dbn
final the effectu perform and compar analysi prove the stabl and reliabl perform of the propos model over exist model
the perform of the propos model is compar with the exist classifi such as nn knn svm dbn and the convent heuristic-bas dbns such as pso-dbn gwo-dbn woa-dbn and roa-dbn for the evalu metric accuraci sensit specif precis fpr fnr npv fdr f1 score and mc
from the result it is expos that the accuraci of the propos mgs-roa-dbn is 30.1% higher than nn 32.2% higher than knn and 17.1% higher than svm and dbn
similar the accuraci of the develop mgs-roa-dbn is 13.8% superior to pso 5.1% superior to gwo 10.8% superior to woa and 2.5% superior to roa .
