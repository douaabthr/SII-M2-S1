autom mammogram breast cancer detect use the optim combin of convolut and recurr neural network
the object of this studi is to frame mammogram breast detect model use the optim hybrid classifi
imag pre-process tumor segment featur extract and detect are the function phase of the propos breast cancer detect
a median filter elimin the nois of the input mammogram
further the optim region grow segment is carri out for segment the tumor from the imag and the optim region grow depend on a hybrid meta-heurist algorithm term as firefli updat chicken base cso fc-cso
to the next of tumor segment featur extract is done which intend to extract the featur like grey level co-occurr matrix glcm and gray level run-length matrix grlm
the two deep learn architectur term as convolut neural network cnn and recurr neural network rnn
moreov both glcm and glrm are consid as input to rnn and the tumor segment binari imag is consid as input to cnn
the result of this studi show that the and oper of two classifi output will tend to yield the overal diagnost accuraci which outperform the convent model .
