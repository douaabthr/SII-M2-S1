a review of genetic-bas evolutionari algorithm in svm paramet optim
paramet optim is a research hotspot of svm and has gain increas interest from various research field
compar with other optim algorithm genetic-bas evolutionari algorithm that have achiev optim accord to the law of separ and free combin in genet are gradual attract much attent
also due to the characterist of self-organ and self-adapt these algorithm often enabl svm to obtain appropri paramet so that the model can be appli to more applic
addit mani improv have been propos in the past two decad in order to allow the optim svm model to obtain better perform
this work focus on review the current state of genetic-bas evolutionari algorithm use to optim paramet of svm and it variant
first we introduc the principl of svm and provid a survey on optim method of it paramet
then we propos a taxonomi of improv genetic-bas evolutionari algorithm accord to code mechan paramet control popul structur evolutionari strategi oper mechan oper and mani other hybrid approach
furthermor this paper analyz and compar the advantag and disadvantag of the abov algorithm explicit and provid their applic scenario as well
final we highlight the exist problem of genetic-bas evolutionari algorithm use for paramet optim of svm and prospect develop trend of this field in the futur .
