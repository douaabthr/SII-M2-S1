mc/dc guid test sequenc priorit use firefli algorithm
optim of the regress test process has been play an import role in develop qualiti softwar
still it is difficult to achiev satisfactori result on the generat of non-redund and optim test sequenc
there are mani optim techniqu appli to regress test
firefli algorithm fa has gain it popular as an optim techniqu to provid better solut in the area of scienc and engin
but the origin fa need to have a better or modifi object function
this work use fa with an improvis object function to generat optim test path guid by modifi condition/decis coverag mc/dc criteria in the form of a guid matrix
this matrix is built with mc/dc influenc valu that we obtain from the predic node of control flow graph cfg
this guid matrix also help in measur the fault-find potenti of a node
it also help in rout firefli to move between the node of a cfg
we have chosen mc/dc criteria as it is the second strongest code coverag criteria due to it linear time complex
then fa is use by defin an appropri object function to travers the graph use firefli
we obtain optim test sequenc after execut the fa
these test sequenc are rank by comput the mean bright of node along a path and then priorit base on their rank
our simul and comparison are valid by experi on sever moder size java program .
