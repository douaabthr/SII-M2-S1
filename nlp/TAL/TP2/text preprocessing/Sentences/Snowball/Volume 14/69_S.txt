voltag stabil constrain transmiss network expans plan use fast converg grey wolf optim algorithm
transmiss network expans plan problem tnep is of utmost import in power system now a day
in this paper a voltag stabil indic l-index is appli to limit the voltag of buse
henc tnep is formul incorpor this voltag stabil featur
thus formul tnep is term as voltag stabil constrain tnep vsc-tnep
tnep has been solv use various convent and non-convent strategi by various research in these day
here tnep and vsc-tnep for ieee-24 bus test system is solv use grey wolf optim techniqu gwo and modifi gwo
the modifi gwo algorithm name fast converg gwo fcgwo is valid over 25 standard benchmark test function and compar with other techniqu .
