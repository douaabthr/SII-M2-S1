aero engin remain use life predict base on enhanc adapt guid differenti evolut
remain use life rul predict is a key process for prognost health manag in almost all engin real-world applic especi which are in hazard and challeng environ where the failur and disastr fault cannot be avoid such as space vehicl and aircraft
this paper propos a predict approach base on our propos algorithm enhanc adapt guid differenti evolut eagd is use to optim the paramet select of support vector machin svm to give high rul predict accuraci
the advantag of the propos approach eagd svm are verifi use the popular benchmark c-mapss which describ the degrad of the aircraft turbofan engin dataset
the experiment studi compar eagd svm with the basic svm with random paramet select and with an optim svm use three differ optim algorithm
also the eagd svm is evalu against three popular classifi model that have been use in the comparison of recent research
differ evalu criteria of classif predict and optim aspect have been use the obtain result show that the eagd is capabl to achiev the lowest classif error rate and rul high predict accuraci through find the optimum valu of the svm paramet with high stabil and fast converg rate .
