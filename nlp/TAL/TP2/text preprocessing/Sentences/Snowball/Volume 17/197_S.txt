a clustering-bas coevolutionari multi-object evolutionari algorithm for handl robust and noisi optim
the presenc of uncertainti is commonplac in real-world scenario
uncertainti can be present in both the object space and the decis space in optim problem
these uncertainti can pose signific challeng for evolutionari algorithm
for exampl perturb in decis variabl robust optim and nois in object function noisi optim
despit the plethora of method propos for robust or noisi optim address both form of uncertainti concurr remain an open research question
we introduc a novel approach base on teda-cmoea/d augment with cluster techniqu for descend generat in robust and noisi optim problem
notabl the propos algorithm yield promis result for uncertainti simultan san the requir for sampl therebi reduc comput complex
we leverag an extens of an exist test function generat for multi-object optim of the test
the benchmark integr uncertainti in decis variabl and/or object function
experiment evalu encompass vari nois intens elucid the impact of differ nois level on algorithm perform
the result demonstr the superior perform of the propos approach compar to exist algorithm specif rnsga-ii and crmoea/d
the propos algorithm emerg as a promis solut for robust and noisi multi-object optim problem .
