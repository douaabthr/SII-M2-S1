optim of job shop schedul problem base on deep reinforc learn
aim at the optim problem of minim the maximum complet time in job shop schedul a deep reinforc learn optim algorithm is propos
first a deep reinforc learn schedul environ is built base on the disjunct graph model and three channel of state characterist are establish
the action space consist of 20 design combin schedul rule
the reward function is design base on the proport relationship between the total work of the schedul oper and the current maximum complet time
the deep convolut neural network is use to construct action network and target network and the state featur are use as input to output the q valu of each action
then the action is select by use the action valid explor and exploit strategi
final the immedi reward is calcul and the schedul environ is updat
experi are carri out use benchmark instanc to verifi the algorithm
the result show that it can balanc solut qualiti and comput time effect and the train agent has good general abil to the schedul problem in the non-zero initi state .
