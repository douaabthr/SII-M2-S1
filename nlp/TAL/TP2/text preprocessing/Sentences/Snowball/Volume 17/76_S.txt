a hybrid manufactur schedul optim strategi in collabor edg comput
in the era of industri 4.0 hybrid schedul base on collabor edg comput has the advantag of high comput power and low latenc which can meet the need of smart manufactur schedul
howev exist schedul scheme cannot strike a balanc between algorithm complex and perform
to address the abov challeng we propos a hybrid schedul model base on collabor edg comput
our propos schedul model integr cloud-edg schedul coarse-grain phase and edge-edg schedul fine-grain phase to meet dynam and real-tim requir
our work is as follow i first we use the johnson bellman algorithm jba to deter mine the task decomposit order in the coarse-grain phase ii second we propos an improv q-network schedul method dqn for the job assign problem in the fine-grain phase iii final we simul the cooper of the two phase to signific reduc the maximum complet time through simul experi
the experiment result show that the method can signific reduc the dynam schedul time and achiev the effect of real-tim schedul .
