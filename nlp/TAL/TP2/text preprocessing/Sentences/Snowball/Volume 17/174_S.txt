comparison of optim approach on linear quadrat regul design for trajectori track of a quadrotor
linear quadrat regul lqr is one of the most preval method use in the control of unman aerial vehicl
lqr control are common employ in the control of both linear and non-linear system due to their advantag such as easy-to-appli and high-perform structur
howev there is one main difficulti that play a signific role in the manner of determin the gain for the control signal choos appropri weight matric
the select of these matric that direct affect the control perform is general perform by trial and error which is labori and time-consum
accord various optim algorithm have been util to determin the weight matric of the lqr control
in this paper the weight matric of the design lqr control were obtain use standard genet algorithm differenti evolut particl swarm optim and grey wolf optim algorithm
the obtain weight matric of the lqr control were test on an unman aerial vehicl simul and the perform of optim algorithm were present compar .
