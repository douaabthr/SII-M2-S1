3d path plan for a robot base on improv ant coloni algorithm
path plan is an import issu in the field of robot research
compar with tradit two-dimension 2d path plan three-dimension 3d path plan is closer to practic applic
in this paper a new improv ant coloni algorithm is propos to solv the problem of slow converg speed low effici and the tendenc of fall into the local optim solut of the tradit ant coloni algorithm for the 3d path plan
there are three main improv step in the novel ant coloni algorithm in 3d path plan
in the first step a pseudo-random state transit strategi is adopt to ensur the global search abil of the algorithm
in the second step the pheromon updat and the pheromon increment calcul method are use to acceler the converg speed of the algorithm which can ensur the qualiti of the solut
in the end step a secur valu function of the heurist function is use to ensur the secur of path
in addit the condit fallback method is use to ensur the global search abil of the algorithm
simul result show that the new improv ant coloni algorithm can find a feasibl three-dimension path quick and effici .
