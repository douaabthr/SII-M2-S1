a multi-strategi slime mould algorithm for solv global optim and engin optim problem
aim at the problem of slow converg low accuraci and easi to fall into local optimum of the slime mould algorithm sma we propos an improv sma ojesma
ojesma improv the perform of the algorithm by combin strategi base on opposition-bas learn joint opposit select and equilibrium optim
first we introduc an adversari learning-opposition-bas learn in generat the initi popul of slime mold
second we incorpor a joint invers select strategi includ select lead opposit and dynam opposit
final we introduc the balanc candid principl of the equilibrium optim algorithm into sma which enhanc the algorithm s optim search capabl and anti-stagn abil
we conduct optim search experi on 29 test function from cec2017 and 10 benchmark test function from cec2020 as well as nonparametr statist analysi friedman and wilcoxon
the experiment result and non-parametr test result show that ojesma has better optim accuraci converg perform and stabil
to further valid the effect of the algorithm we also perform optim test on six engin problem and the variabl index muskingum
in summari ojesma demonstr it practic valu and advantag in solv various complex optim problem with it excel perform provid new perspect and method for the develop of optim algorithm .
