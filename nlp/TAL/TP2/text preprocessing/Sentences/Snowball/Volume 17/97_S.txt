a neural network approach for the solut of van der pol-mathieu-duf oscil model
the concept of oscil problem find it indispens presenc in numer dynam system
machin learn techniqu for handl dynam system is a challeng and rapid expand field of research
in this regard a machin learn approach name symplect artifici neural network model has been use for handl the non-linear system aris in dusti plasma model
the primari object of this articl is to investig the dynam of van der pol-mathieu-duf oscil problem for differ excit function use the meshfre symplect artifici neural network algorithm
the numer simul and graphic represent are carri out to establish the accuraci of the present algorithm
also the obtain simul result are compar with the exist numer solut
in addit the statist assess studi at various test point confirm an excel agreement between the present simul result and the exist result .
