an optim method in wireless sensor network rout and iot with water strider algorithm and ant coloni optim algorithm
a wireless sensor network is a wireless communic network and each sensor node has sever sensor to collect environment inform
wireless sensor network node have limit energi resourc and need optim rout protocol to reduc energi consumpt
failur to reduc energi consumpt by sensor node reduc network life and effici
the main problem in rout is find optim path for send packet by reduc energi consumpt in sensor node
this paper propos an optim rout method to reduc energi consumpt in wireless sensor network
in the first step wireless sensor node are cluster with the water strider algorithm wsa and cluster head are select for rout
in the second step a mobil sink collect the packet from the cluster head and send them to the base station
the mobil sink use the ant coloni optim aco algorithm to travel a shorter path between the cluster head
the author contribut to present a discret version of the wsa algorithm for cluster head select to reduc energi consumpt
the author contribut by provid a more comprehens object function for cluster network node consid error rate energi consumpt pdr rate and euclidean distanc
cluster head travers with a version of the aco algorithm to reduc energi consumpt and cluster head travers code like the tsp problem is the contribut of other author
the paper aim to reduc energi consumpt reduc the error rate of send packet and increas the lifetim of the wireless sensor network
experi are simul on sever simul scenario in matlab
criteria such as energi consumpt packet deliveri ratio pdr packag loss rate and the number of aliv node to evalu the propos method are use
experi show that the propos algorithm reduc the energi consumpt and loss rate of packag of the wireless sensor network by optim select cluster head and increas the pdr and number of aliv node
comparison show in term of energi consumpt packet deliveri ratio pdr loss rate of packag and the number of aliv node the propos method is more effici than particl swarm optim pso grey wolf optim gwo information-centr wireless sensor network and cluster base rout cbr rout method
the pdr index in the propos method is equal to 97.3% and is higher than pso gwo and cs algorithm
the delay of the propos method in rout is 25.97% 5.78% and 17.98% less than hho woa and gwo algorithm respect .
