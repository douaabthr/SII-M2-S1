on the new solut to interv linear fraction program problem
in this paper we studi the interv linear fraction program problem use the concept of g divis
we transform the problem into a new linear fraction program problem and obtain a nondomin solut to the interv linear fraction program problem
we show that the new solut domin the previous nondomin object valu present in the literatur
final some exampl are provid to illustr our result .
