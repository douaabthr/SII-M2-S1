a novel artifici electr field strategi for econom load dispatch problem with renew penetr
this articl present an innov method to address the econom load dispatch eld problem in power system incorpor renew energi sourc within thermal unit
employ the 2 m point estim techniqu for determin renew energi output power the propos approach effect address challeng associ with renewable-bas eld by util the artifici electr field method
inspir by the electrostat forc principl among charg particl this approach guid particl toward optim solut within the search space
valid on power system featur 3 5 6 15 and 40 unit demonstr superior perform compar to establish algorithm confirm by the wilcoxon signed-rank test
the research contribut to the advanc of sustain and effici power system .
