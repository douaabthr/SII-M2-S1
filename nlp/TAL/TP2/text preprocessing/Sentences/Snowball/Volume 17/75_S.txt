many-object optim of wireless sensor network deploy
recent the effici deploy of wireless sensor network wsns has becom a lead field of research in wsn design optim
practic scenario relat to wsn deploy are often consid as optim model with multipl conflict object that are simultan enhanc
in the relat literatur it had been shown that move from mono-object to multi-object resolut of wsn deploy is benefici
howev sinc the deploy of real-world wsns encompass more than three object a multi-object optim may harm other deploy criteria that are conflict with the alreadi consid one
thus our aim is to go further explor the model and the resolut of wsn deploy in a many-object i.e. optim with more than three object fashion and especi exhibit it ad valu
in this context we first propos a many-object deploy model involv seven conflict object and then we solv it use an adapt of the decomposition-bas evolutionari algorithm theta dea
the develop adapt is name wsn theta dea and is valid through a detail experiment studi .
