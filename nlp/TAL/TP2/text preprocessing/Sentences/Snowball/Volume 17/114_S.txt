investig of kriging-bas saea metamodel sampl for comput expens optim problem
surrog model assist evolutionari algorithm saea are strategi wide appli to deal with comput expens optim problem ceop
these method employ metamodel to drive an evolutionari algorithm ea to promis design region where new evalu on the true-object function must be perform
to do this saea are requir to handl the challeng of train a metamodel to improv it predict
the reliabl of a metamodel is strong relat to the sampl use for it train
despit this sever saea are propos without concern about the sampl strategi employ
the ideal situat is to obtain a sampl not far away from the solut predict on the metamodel
in this sens the contribution/novelti of this paper regard an investig studi to compar five strategi for defin the metamodel sampl in a propos saea framework saea/f
the saea/f use a one-dimension ordinari krige ok metamodel and an expect improv ei merit function is appli to defin on which solut to spend the budget of true-funct evalu
in this investig each strategi is incorpor into saea/f and then use to solv a set of analyt function of single-object optim problem
the comput result suggest that two of the five sampl strategi stand out the best
the first strategi choos those solut with the lowest distanc to the centroid of the popul of solut and the second select the newest solut evalu on true-object function
the result highlight the potenti of these approach for solv expens optim problem sinc they speed up the algorithm converg to improv solut .
