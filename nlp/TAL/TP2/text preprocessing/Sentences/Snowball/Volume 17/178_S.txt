random subspac ensembl for direct classifi high-dimension incomplet data
miss valu are a common issu in mani high-dimension dataset but a major of classif algorithm requir complet data
therefor imput method are usual use to estim and fill miss valu with plausibl valu befor use the classif algorithm to learn classifi or use the learnt classifi to classifi unseen incomplet sampl
howev good imput method are usual comput intens on high-dimension dataset becaus these dataset not onli have a larg number of featur but also often suffer from a larg number of miss valu
anoth approach is to use decis tree algorithm which do not need imput and can work direct with incomplet data
howev use decis tree to classifi high-dimension data often lead to larg classif accuraci becaus of the curs of dimension
ensembl techniqu which build multipl classifi instead of a singl classifi have been wide use to improv accuraci for decis tree
this paper aim to investig differ ensembl method to find effect and effici ensembl of decis tree for classif with high-dimension incomplet data
experiment result show that the random subspac method is the most accur ensembl
the random subspac method is also more accur than other classif algorithm which need to combin with imput when work with incomplet data
moreov the random subspac method is much faster than the other algorithm becaus it can direct work on incomplet data so doe not have to spend time estim miss valu .
