ardod adapt radius density-bas outlier detect
outlier detect has garner consider attent in recent year due to it wide-rang applic across various research domain
this surg in interest has led to the develop of numer detect techniqu predomin base on distanc or densiti metric
a notabl limit of these exist method is their relianc on paramet adjust signific affect the outcom
addit these method exhibit intrins flaw distance-bas approach struggl with cluster with vari local densiti while density-bas method fail to identifi pattern within low-dens area
moreov most prior techniqu are adept at identifi onli one kind of outlier local global or group of outlier
address these challeng we introduc the adapt radius density-bas outlier detect ardod method which depart from the tradit parameter-depend approach
ardod is a novel parameter-fre algorithm that dynam determin the necessari paramet base on the data distribut within the featur space
this innov method demonstr robust perform in detect all three categori of outlier
the efficaci and superior perform of ardod are valid through an extens experiment analysi involv various synthet and real-world dataset
