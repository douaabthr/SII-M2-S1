multi-resolut analysi and deep neural network architectur base hybrid featur extract techniqu for plant diseas identif and sever estim
the crop protect techniqu use effici plant diseas identif are high benefici for smart agricultur manag which further decreas the gap between the demand/suppli of consum farmer
howev an effici featur extract techniqu is desir to achiev high accuraci least graphic process and low process time for colour imag
therefor this work propos a hybrid novel featur extract techniqu for colour plant leaf imag to overcom these challeng
this work is divid into two part 1
plant diseas identif and 2
plant diseas sever estim
in this techniqu multiresolut analysi use large-scal coeffici of discret wavelet transform dwt is perform use orthogon wavelet
the orthogon wavelet such as daubechi biorthogon symlet and coiflet with appropri vanish moment are util to select signific featur
then the eigen decomposit of large-scal dwt-base colour imag featur is util use princip compon analysi pca where onli the eigenvalu with larg varianc are consid for further featur select
sever experi are carri out for the select of felicit sub-band decomposit level
the deep neural network dnns architectur such as alexnet resnet 101 and incept v3 are incorpor to classifi the obtain featur
the dnns oper on convolut neural network which util the weight from pre-learn imagenet databas class to classifi various class
the combin of dnns with transfer learn and fine tune is made to tune the paramet for better efficaci
experi were perform on the plantvillag databas which contain healthy/diseas imag of plant such as appl corn grape and tomato leav
a new databas is creat by captur the imag of rice crop leav includ healthi and diseas leav
a total of 8000 imag are process for diseas identif
the propos techniqu provid 99% accuraci for diseas identif task and 90% for diseas sever estim in the real-lif rice dataset and outperform the exist techniqu in this field of research .
