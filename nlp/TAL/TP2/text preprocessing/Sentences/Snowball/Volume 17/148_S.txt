energi awar cluster-bas rout in wsn use hybrid pelican-blu monkey optim algorithm
as the node in wireless sensor network wsns are power by batteri energi effici is a major concern
sinc communic consum the most energi effici rout becom an effect solut
a typic rout strategi is to use hierarch cluster algorithm
in hierarch rout scheme a cluster arrang of sensor node sns is use to facilit data merg and aggreg
the cluster head are in charg of obtain data from the cluster s sns and gather and deliv the data they receiv at bs
these data are combin and pool at the cluster head ch level result in consider energi save
howev there are certain reliabl issu in cluster head select chs and optim rout
to model a chs and optim rout in wsn this work carri out the chs use improv kernel fuzzi c mean cluster for select the ch by consid energi and distanc
then optim rout is done by deploy a novel optim scheme name custom pelican with blue monkey optim cp-bmo which offer the optim rout by consid trust and risk constraint
also the cp-bmo model hold better energi consumpt which is 35.65% 29.42% 38.79% 25.31% 39.85% 39.16% 9.55% 29.39% 39.32% and 39.32% superior to abo rhso pelican bmo f-fli aefa ml-aefa eter ga and qoboa respect
at last the simul outcom confirm the develop approach s effect on pdr network lifetim etc .
