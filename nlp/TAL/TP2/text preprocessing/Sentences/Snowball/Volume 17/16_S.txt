the identif and local of speaker use fusion techniqu and machin learn techniqu
the system of identif and local of speaker are be use newli in divers applic such as smart environ audio confer and secur and social robot which need more accuraci
the object of this work is to defin the local of the speaker in seal space and identifi the speaker in parallel use sound speaker signal
this work propos a simul of speaker local and identif simultan use a featur fusion techniqu by construct a featur vector which contain the featur of identif and featur of local
the fusion techniqu has been use in each step of the propos system such as data featur and decis fusion techniqu
four model were propos for classifi the speaker are the random forest the decis fusion which contain random forest and support vector machin the restrict boltzmann machin which implement by use the tensorflow librari from googl and the long short-term memori techniqu was use which implement use kera librari
the accuraci of the result was 66.39% 82.035% 99.84% and 99.15% respect .
