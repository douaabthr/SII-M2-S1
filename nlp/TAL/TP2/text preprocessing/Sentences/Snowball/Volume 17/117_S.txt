a memet quantum-inspir genet algorithm base on tabu search
over the past few year quantum-inspir genet algorithm as the forerunn of quantum evolutionari algorithm has made signific achiev in solv optim problem in various field
the abil of this algorithm to comprehens search the problem space and discov global extrema is due to the power of the explor process in this algorithm which in turn is attribut to the mutat result from quantum rotat gate
but the best result in evolutionari algorithm are obtain when there is a reason balanc between the explor process general search and the exploit process local search
under such condit the converg speed of the algorithm in find the global optima is no longer suppress
in this research a memet quantum-inspir evolutionari algorithm is propos which is a combin of a quantum genet algorithm and a local search-bas meta-heurist call tabu search
in the propos method mutat of the rotat gate cover the entir problem space and access distant solut
consequ the impuls generat by the tabu search in each iter limit the rang of motion and access to nearbi solut
consecut execut of these two process turn the classic mutat oper into a direct mutat and acceler the converg of evolut
the evalu result of this algorithm on unimod and multimod benchmark function reflect the superior of the propos method over state-of-the-art method in term of converg rate and run time .
