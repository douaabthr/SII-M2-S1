herit of morpholog and behaviour trait in evolv robot
in the field of evolutionari robot choos the correct genet represent is a complic and delic matter especi when robot evolv behaviour and morpholog at the same time
one princip problem is the lack of method or tool to investig and compar represent
in this paper we introduc and evalu such a tool base on the biolog notion of herit
herit captur the proport of phenotyp variat caus by genotyp variat and is often use to better understand the transmiss of trait in real biolog system
as a proof of concept we compar the herit of various robot trait in two system one use a direct tree base represent and one use an indirect grammar base represent
we measur chang in herit dure the cours of evolut and investig how direct and indirect represent can be bias toward more explor or exploit throughout the cours of evolut
the empir studi show that herit can be a use tool to analyz differ represent without run complet evolutionari process use them .
