improv navig paramet and control of autonom robot use hybrid soma pso techniqu
with the develop of scienc and technolog robot gain their popular in autom and industri applic
becaus of this the research are more focuss toward motion plan analysi of mobil robot bipe and humanoid
dure the investig it was discov that the robot are more like to becom trap in local minima and dead end
so this paper aim to provid a novel hybrid artifici intellig techniqu by combin the self organ migrat algorithm soma and particl swarm optim pso for optim path plan and control of singl and multipl mobil robot in a static and dynam environ
differ paramet of soma and pso algorithm guid the robot to reach global optim path in obstacl prone environ
the develop hybrid soma pso techniqu is test in v-rep simul environ with singl and multipl robot and the simul outcom have been authent in an experiment setup under laboratori condit
whenev sensor detect obstacl then the soma pso activ and negoti with obstacl to move up to specifi target
after simul and real-tim experi the propos novel hybrid techniqu is success achiev their target in an optim manner
further a comparison analysi with it standalon techniqu reveal that there is a signific improv in navig paramet
again the techniqu is test against exist paper and an averag improv of 17.76% is observ by use the propos hybrid techniqu .
