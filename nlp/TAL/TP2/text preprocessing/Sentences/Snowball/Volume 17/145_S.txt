improv harri hawk optim algorithm to solv the multi-depot open vehicl rout problem
the multi-depot open vehicl rout problem mdovrp is onli one exampl of sever optim problem that are classifi as np-hard
therefor heurist and metaheurist approach are help in obtain a near-optim solut
a hybrid hho algorithm call hho-pso is propos in this work to address the mdovrp
the goal is to minim cost for the rout of a fleet of vehicl that start move from depot and fulfil custom demand
to improv the explor of the harri hawk optim hho algorithm the explor method of particl swarm optim pso which is more robust is use in this paper
experiment result prove that the propos hybrid algorithm work better than the origin pso and hho in discret space in term of balanc exploit and explor to solv the mdovrp
moreov the suggest algorithm is compar to five cutting-edg approach on 24 mdovrp instanc with a broad number of custom
the comput find reveal that the suggest approach outperform the other compar metaheurist techniqu in solv the mdovrp .
