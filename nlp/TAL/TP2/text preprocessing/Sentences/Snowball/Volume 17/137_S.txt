marin predat social group optim a hybrid approach
numer heurist and metaheurist algorithm inspir by natur have been develop so far
these algorithm have demonstr their excel in resolv challeng problem across a varieti of field
howev mani optim algorithm fail while solv a complex real-world problem effici in an independ way becaus these problem have a distinct search behavior as they contain numer equal and inequ constraint of the linear nonlinear and non-convex type
in this studi two optim algorithm the marin predat algorithm mpa and the social group optim sgo algorithm are hybrid in order to increas their effici and problem-solv capabl to solv this type of problem
this propos hybrid optim algorithm is name as marin predat social group optim mpsgo algorithm
this hybrid algorithm combin the strength of both techniqu to enhanc the effici and effect of the optim process
it is valid through thirti benchmark function of cec2014 and after that 26 real-world optim problem test suit of cec 2020 from the chemic and mechan engin domain have been solv
the valid result are compar with ten state-of-art optim algorithm and real-world optim problem result is compar with bipop matrix adapt evolut strategi bp-ϵmag- enhanc multi-oper differenti evolut enmod lshade for constrain optim colshad cohort intellig self-adapt penalti function ci-sapf and cohort intellig self-adapt penalti function collid bodi optim ci-sapf-cbo
as mpsgo is a hybrid algorithm again we have compar it perform with the seven best modifi and improv optim algorithm
in term of converg qualiti and improv solut qualiti the simul result of mpsgo have been shown to be competit with those of state-of-the-art hybrid improv and advanc optim algorithm prove the valid as well as the feasibl of the mpsgo algorithm .
