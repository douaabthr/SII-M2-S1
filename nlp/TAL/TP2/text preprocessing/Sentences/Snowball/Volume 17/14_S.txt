qos base deliv model of the packag transport by the passeng train and solut algorithm
in recent year statist show that the percentag of household consumpt in gdp is get higher and higher
one of the subsequ influenc is that the transport demand for packag has increas sharpli
henc it is veri necessari to propos divers transport organ mode in accord with the differ situat in differ countri
a kind of new transport mode multi-packag multi-train pickup and deliveri problem with time window mpmt-pdptw is propos in this paper
it aim to achiev express packag transport with minimum cost and maxim util of luggag car of a passeng train at the same time
consid the multipl constraint such as limit carri capac fix depart and accept time we defin thequal of servic qos as the evalu criteria for packag express transport by the passeng train
a kind of meta-heurist algorithm greedi random adapt search procedur grasp is design to make full use of the redund capac of railway luggag car
an exampl is design accord to the railway passeng train timet releas bychina railway corpor crc the assign scheme of packag at differ railway station reveal that the new transport mode propos in this paper is feasibl and practic in packag express transport and also has advantag in speed compar with the highway and in transport cost over the airlin .
