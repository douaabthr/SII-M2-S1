design and manufactur of an x-ray generat by support vector machin
one approach to the design experiment paramet set and assembl of an x-ray generat get perform to reduc radiat emiss microgray mu gy without neglect the power of the beam emiss kvp
a combin get made in the manufactur of the transform coil between turn of the secondari wind s_ k with the number of turn of the filament f_ i
as a result we obtain a transform with an emiss between the desir paramet and the optimum beam power
we classifi feasibl and infeas case in the assembl of x-ray devic use support vector machin
in addit the tool use for statist infer were non-parametr test such as the modifi friedman test and post-hoc quad and conov test
final we obtain a good imag with an excel resolut without expos peopl to high radiat emiss .
