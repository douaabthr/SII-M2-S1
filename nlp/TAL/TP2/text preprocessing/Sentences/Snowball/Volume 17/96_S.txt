design and develop of mobil anchor assist node local strategi use a hybrid electric-coyot optim
as wireless sensor network wsns offer essenti support for sever location-awar applic and protocol local is one of the princip methodolog in wsn
in the literatur the mobil anchor node is prefer over the static anchor node to handl the high overhead issu caus by the larger number of anchor node
in recent year the mobil anchor node assist local manal problem has receiv signific attent in various research work and path-plan techniqu for local use fewer anchor node have been implement
howev recent manal breakthrough in wsns have provid ampl research opportun
the mobil anchor node is use in this paper to solv the node local problem in wsn
the locat of the target node are determin use a hybrid electric-coyot optim algorithm he-coa the mobil anchor node and the virtual anchor node
the object of the propos local is to minim the distanc error between actual node coordin and estim node coordin
various path trajectori are investig in simul to demonstr the efficaci of the suggest work
the simul result show that the propos algorithm can reduc the local error compar to the convent model .
