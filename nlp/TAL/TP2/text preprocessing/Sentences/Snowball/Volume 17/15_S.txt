log-period power law hybrid model base on bp neural network
stock market crash bring about huge econom loss so predict the stock market crash is extrem import for both the investor and practition
back propag bp neural network perform great in data adapt and fit it has been wide use for forecast studi in various field
howev given the low frequenc and lack of period of stock market crash the bp neural network can hard predict the intens fluctuat stock price accur dure the crash
to resolv this issu we introduc bp neural network into log-period power law model propos the log-period power law hybrid model base on the bp neural network
this combin approach could further captur the fluctuat trend and predict the volatil dure the stock market crash better
the experiment result show that this hybrid model could predict the stock price in differ stock market with a slight increas accuraci
moreov it perform was more stabl compar with bp neural network .
