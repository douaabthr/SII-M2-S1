uncertain infer network in evidenti reason
as a domin method in evidenti reason bayesian network has been prove power in discret field
although bayesian network perform reliabl in continu variabl and interv estim it reli on discret continu variabl or build an approxim model to conduct which caus inform loss and accuraci reduct
in order to bridg this gap this paper introduc two infer rule combin with four infer rule propos by other scholar
then we propos a concept of uncertain infer network that consist of six basic structur match infer rule to repres relationship and logic connect among the evid
evid is repres by uncertain set that can appli to continu variabl use membership function to repres vagu concept
furthermor a numer experi for a forens investig of fire incid is given to compar the result of uncertain infer network and bayesian network
we found three merit in the case studi
first an uncertain infer network has simpler data access for each node becaus bayesian network depend on condit probabl tabl while uncertain infer network onli reli on membership function
second an uncertain infer network has a more wide applic becaus it can perform continu variabl with certain mathemat formula without discret or approxim
third an uncertain infer network has a more accur result becaus bayesian network give a point estim with a 0 1 valu while uncertain infer network conduct an interv estim with a rang valu .
