a game theori base approach for distribut dynam spectrum access
in this studi we explor the task of dynam spectrum access base on game theori to mitig spectrum shortag and improv network util in multichannel wireless network
usual the avail network bandwidth is limit and divid into sever channel and there exist a need for effici reus and adapt alloc of such channel
dure the communic process uuser compet with each other forcshar channel even without know accur complet channel state inform
in order to avoid collis tradit method usual depend on central schedul or messag exchang which are cumbersom and comput expens
to deal with this issu we propos a deep q-network base on lstm and fair channel alloc polici to learn the dynam spectrum access rule for network util maxim
extens valid of the propos approach show that our scheme yield quit promis result .
