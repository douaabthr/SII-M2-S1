deep learn applic in the internet of thing a review tool and futur direct
the emerg of the internet of thing iot has enabl the prolifer of interconnect devic and sensor generat vast amount of often complex and unstructur data
deep learn dl a subfield of machin learn ml has shown great promis in address the challeng of process and analyz such data
consid the increas import of dl and data analysi we decid to review the articl of the last few year in this field to pave the way for research
in this articl we use the systemat literatur review slr method and in line with that we select and analyz 56 articl publish from 2019 to april 2024
we first discuss the dl model use in the iot field and clarifi their specif use case
second we outlin an analysi of research area in dl-base iot
in addit our research extend to the tool and simul use to evalu studi in the dl-base iot domain
we also examin the dl-base iot research dataset
final our review identifi futur direct and open issu in dl-base iot
we aim to contribut to an accur understand of the current state challeng and potenti breakthrough at the intersect of dl and the iot .
