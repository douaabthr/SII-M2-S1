gaussian mixtur model for train bayesian convolut neural network
bay by backprop is a variat infer method base on the reparametr trick to assur backpropag in bayesian neural network
general the approxim distribut use in bay by backprop method are made unimod to facilit the use of the reparametr trick
but frequent the model of some task requir more sophist distribut
this paper describ the bay by backprop algorithm with a multi-model distribut for train bayesian convolut neural network
specif we illustr how to reparameter the cnn paramet for a gaussian mixtur model
we then show that the result compar favour to exist variat algorithm on various classif dataset
final we illustr how to use this distribut to estim epistem and aleator uncertainti .
