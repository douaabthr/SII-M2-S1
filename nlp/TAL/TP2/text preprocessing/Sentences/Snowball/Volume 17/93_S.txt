self a stacked-bas ensembl learn framework for breast cancer classif
nowaday breast cancer is the most preval and jeopard diseas in women after lung cancer
dure the past few decad a substanti amount of cancer case have been report throughout the world
breast cancer has been a wide acknowledg categori of cancer diseas in women due to the lack of awar
accord to the world cancer survey report 2020 about 2.3 million case and 685,000 death have been report worldwid
as the patient-doctor ratio pdr is veri high consequ there is an utmost need for a machine-bas intellig breast cancer diagnosi system that can detect cancer at it earli stage and cure it more effici
the plan is to assembl scientist in both the restor and the machin learn field to progress toward this clinic applic
this paper present self a stacked-bas ensembl learn framework to classifi breast cancer at an earli stage from the histopatholog imag of tumor cell with computer-aid diagnosi tool
in this work we use the breakhi dataset with 7909 histopatholog imag and wisconsin breast cancer databas wbcd with 569 instanc for the perform evalu of our propos framework
we have train sever distinct classifi on both dataset and select the best five classifi on the basi of their accuraci measur to creat our ensembl model
we use the stack ensembl techniqu and consid the extra tree random forest adaboost gradient boost and knn9 classifi as the base learner and the logist regress model as a final estim
we have evalu the perform of self on the breakhi dataset and wbcd dataset and achiev test accuraci of approxim 95% and 99% respect
the result of the other perform paramet on the breakhi and the wbcd dataset also show that our propos framework outperform with f1-score roc and mcc score .
