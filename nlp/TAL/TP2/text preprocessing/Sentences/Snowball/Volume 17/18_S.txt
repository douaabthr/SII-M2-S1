structur reliabl optim model with credibilist safeti constraint
some tradit fuzzi reliabl model quantifi the system uncertainti base on possibl measur metric without self-dual which lead to the undesir result that the sum of possibl of ani one fuzzi set/ev and it complementari set/ev is not equal to one
to overcom this drawback this paper formul a new reliabl metric tool base on self-dual credibl measur
first we introduc credilist safeti constraint to formul credibilist reliabl optim model on the basi of limit-st function
then sever theorem are provid to show that the feasibl domain generat by credibilist safeti constraint can be reformul as the equival convex domain under mild assumpt which enabl credibilist safeti constraint to reformul as the equival reliabl constraint
final one numer exampl on the optim design of three-bar truss structur is provid to show the applic of the credibilist reliabl optim model
by use out-of-sampl back-test these comparison result are state on the provid reliabl level and the back-test reliabl level which evid the effect of the optim solut achiev by the propos model for practic structur engin .
