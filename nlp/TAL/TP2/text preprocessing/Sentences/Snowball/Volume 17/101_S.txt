intellig contribut of the artifici orca algorithm for continu problem and real-tim emerg medic servic
the artifici orca algorithm aoa is an exist swarm intellig algorithm empow in this paper by two well-known mutat oper and opposition-bas learn yield the novel method deep self-learn artifici orca algorithm dslaoa opposit deep self-learn artifici orca algorithm odslaoa and opposit artifici orca learn algorithm
the dslaoa and odslaoa are base on the cauchi and gauss mutat oper
their effect is evalu on both continu and discret problem
the suggest algorithm are test and compar to seven recent state-of-the-art metaheurist in the continu context
the result demonstr that when compar to the other algorithm dslaoa base on the cauchi oper is the most effect techniqu
after that a specif real-world scenario involv emerg medic servic in a dire situat is tackl
the ambul dispatch and emerg call cover problem is the address problem and a mathemat formul is made to model this issu
aoa dslaoac and dslaoag are test and contrast with a success recent heurist in this field
the experi are run on real data and the result show that the swarm approach are effect and help in determin the resourc requir in this kind of emerg .
