adapt wideband sens scheme base on bayesian experiment design
in this paper we investig the problem of wideband sens for cognit radio
due to resourc constraint a cognit node target at find a given number of spectrum hole which is studi under a novel wideband sens architectur
specif the cognit node can dynam focus it sens measur on differ portion of contigu channel
an adapt wideband sens scheme is propos under the standard bayesian experiment design framework via three step 1 defin a bayesian cost that incorpor the number of desir spectrum hole 2 design hypothesi test rule to detect access opportun and 3 identifi a scheme to adapt the measur dure the sens process
in order to facilit implement we further propos an approxim bayesian experi design scheme to reduc the comput complex
the perform gain of our wideband sens scheme is demonstr via numer simul .
