simplifi u-net as a deep learn intellig medic assist tool in glaucoma detect
glaucoma is look on as the most import caus of irremedi vision loss worldwid
earli detect of eye diseas especi glaucoma is serious for prepar time medic care and keep down the vision loss
in this paper a fast segment algorithm is propos which is base on a new simplifi u-net architectur for optic disc and retin vessel segment
the propos method includ a modifi and reinforc structur that will reduc the predict time while maintain the perform and accuraci at an compar level due to other state of the art method
for exampl for optic disc segment the propos method can segment the optic disc in 0.008 second on drions-db dataset and for vessel segment it can segment in 0.03 second on drive dataset
accord to these result and an extens of the propos method can be use as a real-tim intellig medic system which abl to be implement on the usual hardwar equip in the ophthalmolog clinic
this method which can perform optic disc and retin vessel segment task in a short time increas the perform of ophthalmologist in glaucoma diagnos .
