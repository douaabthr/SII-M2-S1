genet algorithm base approach to solv the cluster steiner tree problem
in a complex network applic a set of node might be partit into multipl local cluster with differ function properti or communic protocol and the communic is restrict between node of the same cluster to maxim effici and other secur concern
thus there has been a rise in network design problem with addit constraint regard the cluster of vertic one of them be cluster steiner tree problem a variant of the steiner tree problem
recent a heuristic-bas algorithm was propos to solv the problem
howev it obtain result is limit in term of solut qualiti when appli to the problem in the euclidean case
this paper propos a genet algorithm call shortest-path genet algorithm for solv the clustein
in the propos a permutation-bas individu represent that reduc the dimension of chromosom to the number of cluster is devis
the propos algorithm can solv the problem in both euclidean and non-euclidean case
experi result compar to exist work in the literatur are analyz in detail to prove the effect of the propos algorithm .
