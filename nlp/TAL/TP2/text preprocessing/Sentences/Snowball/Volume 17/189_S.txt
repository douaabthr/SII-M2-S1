extend water wave optim ewwo techniqu a propos approach for task schedul in iomt and healthcar applic
the internet of medic thing iomt is a version of the internet of thing
it is get the attent of research becaus it can be use in a wide rang of smart healthcar system
one of the main advanc employ recent is the iomt-cloud which allow user to access cloud servic remot over the internet
these cloud servic requir an effici task schedul approach that satisfi the qualiti of servic paramet with a low energi consumpt
this paper present an overview of the integr of iomt and cloud comput technolog
besid this work propos an effici extend water wave optim ewwo task schedul in the iomt cloud for healthcar applic
ewwo algorithm perform base on it oper propag refract and break
the propos ewwo schedul techniqu minim the energi consumpt makespan time execut time and increas the resourc util
cloudsim simul is use to simul the iomt-cloud environ to verifi the effect of ewwo techniqu
the perform has been evalu base on various paramet such as energi consumpt makespan time and execut time .
