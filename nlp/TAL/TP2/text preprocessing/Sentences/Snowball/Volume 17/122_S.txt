a divers preserv genet algorithm with tailor-mad variat oper for the quadrat bottleneck knapsack problem
this paper deal with a variat of the knapsack problem call the quadrat bottleneck knapsack problem qbkp
in qbkp there is a quadrat cost associ with each pair of object and the object is to minim the maximum quadrat cost such that sumtot of weight of object should be at least equal to the capac of knapsack
despit the practic applic of this mathcal n mathcal p hard problem in select invest for a portfolio it remain an under-studi problem as onli a few exact and heurist approach exist in the literatur
this has motiv us to develop a metaheurist approach base on steady-st genet algorithm ssga for the qbkp
our ssga approach use worst among most similar replac strategi to preserv use popul divers which has a signific impact on the perform of our algorithm
further our crossov and mutat oper are design as per the characterist of the qbkp
we have experiment compar the perform of our propos approach with those avail in the literatur and clear demonstr our approach to be better .
