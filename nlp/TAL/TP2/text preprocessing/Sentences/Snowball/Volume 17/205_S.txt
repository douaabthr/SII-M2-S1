hybrid meta-heurist solv no-wait flow shop schedul minim maximum tardi
the non-wait constraint is a crucial factor in industri with continu product flow
recogn the signific of this constraint in the manufactur process we propos sever approach to minim the maximum tardi in the no-wait manufactur flow shop schedul problem
this research present two main approach an exact method that util mix integ linear program and an approxim method base on construct heurist and hybrid meta-heurist
to tackl the problem we introduc multipl heurist and hybrid improv meta-heurist base nawaz enscor ham greedi random adapt search procedur and genet algorithm
furthermor we propos three hybrid meta-heurist base on the simul anneal approach
to valid the effect and robust of our method we conduct experi on multipl instanc of the flow shop problem propos by taillard
the result demonstr that the hybrid algorithm which combin a greedi random adapt search procedur with the insert procedur and simul anneal exhibit strong perform
in fact this algorithm achiev a success rate of 72 across 200 test instanc
it outperform the other two meta-heurist with a minimum averag relat percentag deviat of onli 0.0039 .
