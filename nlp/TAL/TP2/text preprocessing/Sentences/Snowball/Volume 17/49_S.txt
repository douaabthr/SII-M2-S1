high adapt regress tree
the develop of machin learn method that are both accur and interpret is of paramount import in healthcar and mani other field
the high adapt lasso hal has been shown to have predict perform on par with state-of-th art algorithm
hal involv perform regular regress of the outcom on a tensor product of indic basi function
in this paper we show that this basi can be repres as a non-recurs partit of the featur space and propos a method for map this partit impli by hal to a recurs partit
such a map then allow for the represent of hal as a decis tree therebi provid interpret of predict made by the algorithm
we refer to this post-hoc method for interpret as high adapt regress tree hart
we provid a set of algorithm to construct this map and conveni visual the result tree
use real data we show that hal s predict perform is on par with state-of-the-art method and we demonstr the construct and interpret of hart .
