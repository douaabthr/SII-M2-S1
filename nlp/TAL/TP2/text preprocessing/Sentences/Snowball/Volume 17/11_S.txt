a perform simul and verif method of packet schedul algorithm for data stream base on qos
in the process of network-bas data flow transmiss for various applic of inform servic there are some problem such as limit bandwidth and unclear prioriti level of busi data which affect the end-to-end reliabl transmiss effici becaus the system cannot perceiv the link state
tradit parallel link redund scheme have not fundament solv the problem of invulner and reliabl
on the basi of sort out the demand of servic data flow transmiss this paper propos a perform verif method of data flow packet schedul algorithm base on qos to solv the problem of network delay and congest and explor a reliabl end-to-end servic data flow transmiss mode .
