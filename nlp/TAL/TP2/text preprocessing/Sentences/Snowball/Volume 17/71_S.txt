a robust featur select method base on meta-heurist optim for speech emot recognit
most of the tradit featur select method do not show effect perform on speech emot recognit system
one of the recent advanc in the featur select is use meta-heurist optim algorithm
individu each algorithm play a key role in mani speech process base applic
howev hybrid meta-heurist are one most impress techniqu in the field of featur select and optim problem
henc in this paper propos a new robust hybrid-meta-heurist featur select model name as cseo fs model as to improv the accuraci of ser task and also reduc the burden of comput capabl
in this studi we investig the perform of the propos approach use speech-bas emot data-set such as emodb and ravdess which are primarili use in the develop of human-comput interact system
the experiment result confirm the superior of the propos featur select in term of classif accuraci precis f1-score and number of select featur
compar to state-of-the-art featur select method for ser system our experiment result show us achiev 94.35% and 96.78% high-level emot recognit rate respect .
