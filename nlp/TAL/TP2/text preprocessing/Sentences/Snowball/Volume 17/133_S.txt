center of graviti cog a novel optim algorithm
this paper propos a novel optim algorithm call center of graviti cog
the main idea of cog is attribut the potenti function to a set of particl in problem space and find the contour line
with each particl move with a predefin locat in search space the potenti function is defin base on particl s fit valu
the particl are then rank accord to their finess
through cluster of particl the contour line will be construct which then lead to determin their center of graviti
this process will iter continu by updat the particl in each iter and ultim achiev the global cog
the propos cog algorithm is shown to be use for differ type of uni-mod to multi-mod benchmark function
also optim some import engin problem has been consid
the perform of this new optim algorithm has been compar with some of the optim algorithm
simul result confirm that the cog algorithm provid perform improv compar to other exist method in various scenario .
