a template-bas algorithm by geometr mean for the automat and effici recognit of music chord
in this work we introduc a template-bas comput method to recogn chord through an audio record of a music instrument
the algorithm is base on a tempor frequenc analysi use gabor s filter bank
these filter are center over adjust frequenc of music note in differ octav and the adjust is accomplish in term of the detun on the record
use the result in the filter stage a geometr mean of each chord is calcul
it is import to mention that these statist are calcul from the combin of note that form each chord and are automat group as templat
the presenc of chord is determin from these metric
sever experi are carri out for major minor augment diminish and suspend chord play on acoust guitar classic guitar electr guitar piano and ukulel
a compar studi against machine-learn classifi is present
the result show a superior perform of the present approach
in addit the propos method present the advantag that it doe not requir a train stage in contrast with the method base on machine-learn algorithm
this reduc signif the storag and time requier for process .
