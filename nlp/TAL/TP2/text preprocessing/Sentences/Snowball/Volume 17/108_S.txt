multi-object social group optim for machin process
a multi-object social group optim mosgo is propos in this studi as a method for resolv problem with multipl object
the initi step is to use an extern chronicl with a predetermin size to store the exist non-domin pareto optimum solut
follow that solut are chosen from this repositori use a roulett wheel mechan base on the coverag of solut to guid individu in the direct of promis region of multi-object search space
the propos method is test on ten cec2009 multi-object benchmark problem and it has been compar to two well-known meta-heurist the multi-object evolutionari algorithm base on decomposit moea/d algorithm and the multi-object particl swarm optim mopso algorithm
it is essenti to the machin process to choos the optimum machin paramet in order to guarante product qualiti lower machin cost boost product and preserv resourc for sustain
henc mosgo a posterior multi-object optim method is use in this studi to tackl the multi-object optim problem of three machin process includ turn wire-electric-discharg machin and laser cut
the result of the mosgo algorithm are compar with the result obtain use ga nsga-ii pso and iter search method and are found to be compar
here it has been observ that the mosgo algorithm achiev the pareto-optim set of solut in a veri less number of function evalu as compar to other algorithm show a higher converg speed
the pareto-optim set of solut for each optim problem is obtain and report
these pareto-optim set of solut are help for real product system and will aid the decision-mak in tumultu situat .
