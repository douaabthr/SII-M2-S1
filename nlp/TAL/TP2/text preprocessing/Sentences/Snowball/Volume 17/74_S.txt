covid-19 pneumonia level detect use deep learn algorithm and transfer learn
the first covid-19 confirm case was report in wuhan china and spread across the globe with an unpreced impact on human
sinc this pandem requir pervas diagnosi develop smart fast and effici detect techniqu is signific
to this end we have develop an artifici intellig engin to classifi the lung inflamm level mild progress sever stage of the covid-19 confirm patient
in particular the develop model consist of two phase in the first phase we calcul the volum and densiti of lesion and opac of the ct scan imag of the confirm covid-19 patient use morpholog approach
the second phase classifi the pneumonia level of the confirm covid-19 patient
we use a modifi convolut neural network cnn and k-nearest neighbor we also compar the result of both model to the other classif algorithm to precis classifi lung inflamm
the experi show that the cnn model can provid test accuraci up to 95.65% compar with exit classif techniqu
the propos system in this work can be appli effici to ct scan and x-ray imag dataset
also in this work the transfer learn techniqu has been use to train the pre-train modifi cnn model on a smaller dataset than the origin dataset the modifi cnn achiev 92.80% of test accuraci for detect pneumonia on chest x-ray imag for the relat extens dataset .
