cluster base activ learn for classif of evolv stream
classif of imbalanc unlabel data stream with concept drift in evolv stream has pose mani challeng recent
learner perform from the minor class is poor at high imbal degre
this caus drift detect to fail
therefor the exist model cannot be updat result in poor classifi perform
detect drift is typic done through supervis learn
they are impract despit their effect in detect drift
in real-world applic onli a portion of the data stream can be label as oracl assist is pricey and labori
to allevi these problem a novel techniqu which is a cluster base activ learn for class imbal and concept drift cbal is present in the paper
adapt sampl strategi are use for solv high imbal degre
a two-lay drift detect strategi is use for detect drift where the first layer is unsupervis and the second layer is supervis
to reduc the label cost this framework use a cluster techniqu for queri the label
extens experi over synthet and real-world data stream exhibit better classif perform
cbal detect the drift with fewer fals alarm and with lesser oracl intervent
for high imbalanc case i.e. 10% the perform of cbal is 53% and higher wherea the perform of the other algorithm is zero or nil
the number of drift detect by cbal is much more accur and it also reduc the label cost by 90% .
