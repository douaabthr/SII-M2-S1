solv multi-object truss structur optim problem consid natur frequenc of vibrat and automat member group
minim the mass of a structur and maxim it first natur frequenc of vibrat are conflict object of real interest in structur design
to avoid problem with reson which can lead to their collaps structur can be design by make the first natur frequenc of vibrat high
furthermor it is crucial to stay away from excit frequenc
here we formul and solv multi-object structur optim problem of truss with these conflict object
this type of problem is uncommon in the literatur sinc the natur frequenc of vibrat are general set as constraint rather than as object function
the general differenti evolut 3 gde3 the nondomin sort genet algorithm ii nsga-ii decis space-bas nich dn-nsga-ii the competit mechanism-bas multi-object particl swarm optim cmopso and the mopso with multipl search strategi mmopso are the algorithm use in this paper
addit cardin constraint are use to manag the difficulti of discov the best member group which is veri effect in address the problem analyz in this paper
the experi refer to the 10 25 72 and 200 bar truss
each involv two analys take into account the perform indic and the use of a multi tournament decis mtd method to extract the desir solut
furthermor the design variabl of each extract solut includ it optim topolog are provid .
