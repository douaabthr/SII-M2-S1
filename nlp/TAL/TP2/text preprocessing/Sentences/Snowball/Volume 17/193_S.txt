a realist and sustain logist transport plan a new cost model meta-heurist solv approach and result
accur logist cost enabl effici and cost-effect plan of transport system
it facilit the fast on-tim and seamless transport of good between the citi
exist cost model are base on the unit transport cost of good which could be more realist and accur
in this work we introduc a new cost function base on the unit transport cost of a truck to overcom the undercharg or overcharg issu in the exist cost function
the propos cost function best suit the govern and industri when develop the facil
this work also present the logist transport problem formul of a cost function use integ program and methodolog to solv the transport problem use meta-heurist algorithm
in addit we construct a new transport problem for one district-on product odop use real-world scenario and data
odop is an initi of the uttar pradesh govern for the balanc econom develop of the state in india
we solv this 18 citi problem use eight meta-heurist algorithm
our experiment simul find an optim logist cost of rs
2159140.00 for four logist hub and 14 distribution/collect centr
our observ also identifi the depend of network configur over various factor like establishment/rent and oper cost the unit cost of transport and the capac of vehicl instead of onli on product suppli and demand of goods/product
our evalu also report an 80% consist result by the anti-predatori nature-inspir algorithm compar to the other state-of-the-art algorithm .
