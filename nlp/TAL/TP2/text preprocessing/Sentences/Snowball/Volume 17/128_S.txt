eleph flow detect intellig for software-defin network a survey on current techniqu and futur direct
software-defin network sdn is character by the separ of the packet forward plane from the network control plane
this separ offer an extens view of the network s state enhanc network resili and manag
network traffic classif can improv sdn control and resourc provis particular for eleph flow ef detect
exist techniqu for detect ef util preset threshold and bandwidth that are inadequ for chang traffic concept
moreov these techniqu consum high data plane-control bandwidth and have a high detect time
this research first describ the relat manag techniqu in sdn
then accord to the detect locat eleph flow detect approach are classifi into four kind host-bas switch-bas controller-bas and hybrid controller-switch-bas detect
this research examin four type of detect approach and conclud that host-bas detect primarili reli on the flow statist threshold
such approach frequent gather flow statist by monitor the socket buffer or via the hypervisor
in contrast switch-bas detect can leverag both the flow statist threshold and flow characterist
controller-bas detect techniqu in sdn focus on extract flow featur statist at the control level aim to reduc switch overhead while potenti increas control load
final hybrid controller-switch-bas detect combin both rout aspect offer fine-grain flow control
howev it face challeng in maintain a balanc in timeli accuraci and cost
furthermor the survey incorpor recent sdn advanc such as machin learning-bas method programm switch and real-world sdn applic in data center global content deliveri network healthcar and iot
final the articl make a comprehens comparison and put forward sever point of futur predict in term of eleph flow detect take into account recent advanc in sdn research .
