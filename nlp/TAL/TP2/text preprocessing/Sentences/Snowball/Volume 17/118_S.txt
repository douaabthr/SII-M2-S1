batch metaheurist a migration-fre framework for metaheurist algorithm
metaheurist have emerg as one of the promin problem-solv methodolog to handl optim problem as they can provid good qualiti solut within accept time limit
numer studi have been conduct in the field of metaheurist propos novel algorithm modif in the exist one etc to improv the perform of the metaheurist framework
the multi-popul or island approach is one such modif where solut are divid into smaller subpopul and migrat from one subpopul to anoth to share inform
though use this approach is often ignor due to addit paramet the burden of tune them increas time complex addit task of decid migrat polici migrat ratio etc
in the present work we have propos a novel framework to enhanc the perform of exist population-bas metaheurist algorithm and name it batch metaheurist
the present framework is easi to implement and understand has no migrat of solut among batch and is general in natur i. e can easili be incorpor with ani population-bas algorithm such as a genet algorithm particl swarm optim gravit search algorithm and other
it divid the set of solut in each iter into sever batch that are individu expos to the algorithm chosen with differ paramet valu
we includ the batch approach in two well-establish population-bas metaheurist genet algorithm and particl swarm optim
the approach is test over fifteen benchmark function five shift benchmark function and three classic engin problem
the result obtain confirm the better perform of the batch approach over it non-batch counterpart
this approach incur numer associ benefit when put to use .
