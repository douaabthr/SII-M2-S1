a recurr anfi tune by modifi differenti evolut for effici predict of softwar reliabl
softwar failur predict is a crucial task in softwar qualiti assur
although time seri forecast techniqu and convent softwar reliabl model are use for the predict of softwar reliabl veri often these model fail to provid accur predict
therefor an accur model for softwar reliabl predict is imper
the object of this paper is to introduc a hybrid model that merg a recurr adapt neuro-fuzzi infer system ranfi and modifi differenti evolut mde for softwar reliabl predict
the model employ inner spatial feedback loop and delay output feedback to improv the convent neuro-fuzzi system s predict abil while deal with time seri softwar failur data
the hybrid model is train by mde where a new scheme of crossov and mutat has been propos
we conduct an extens simul on a few public avail benchmark dataset for comput the predict abil of our hybrid model
simul result along with statist analysi illustr that our hybrid model predict more precis the time between success failur in softwar and outperform other tradit model .
