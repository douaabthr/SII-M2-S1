the improv grasshopp optim algorithm with cauchi mutat strategi and random weight oper for solv optim problem
an improv grasshopp optim algorithm goa is propos in this paper term cmrwgoa which combin both random weight short rwgoa and cauchi mutat term cmgoa mechan into the goa
the goa receiv inspir from the forag and swarm habit of grasshopp
the perform of the cmrwgoa was valid by 23 benchmark function in comparison with four well-known meta-heurist algorithm aha da goa and mvo cmgoa rwgoa and the goa
the non-parametr wilcoxon friedman and nemenyi statist test are conduct on the cmrwgoa
furthermor the cmrwgoa has been evalu in three real-lif challeng optim problem as a complementari studi
various strict extens experiment result reveal that the cmrwgoa exhibit better perform .
