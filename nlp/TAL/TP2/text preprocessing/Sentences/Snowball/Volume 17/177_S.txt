detect of rice type and it storag durat via an improv particl swarm optim algorithm
due to the non-select behavior of gas sensor in electron nose e-nos system the provid signal in exposur to target analyt contain un-need inform
these are consid as nois reduc the detect accuraci
featur select as a pre-process step in data analysi remov extra inform from the sensor signal and provid a more relev data matrix with lower dimension to enhanc the system select
in the high-dimension sensor array respons space it is howev essenti to improv the convent algorithm to be abl to cope with complic featur select problem
in this studi in order to acquir optim respons from the gas sensor array of an e-nos system and increas it select for detect of rice type and it storag durat fresh the featur select problem was formul in an optim framework
for this reason a particl swarm optim pso with an automat stagnat detect system was enhanc by genet oper of differenti evolut
this help acquir more explor abil through provid orient jump
it was reveal that the system s detect accuraci was improv when smaller subset of featur was util instead of the whole respons indic that the sensor array signal includ larg amount of irrelev inform
the improv pso could signific present lower error valu than the standard pso and other examin convent algorithm
it was conclud the develop algorithm has the potenti to be appli as a promis featur select algorithm in high-dimension signal of the e-nos system .
