a recent approach base on inspir crow behavior in steganographi
nowaday prevent data transmiss via network from unauthor access has becom crucial
in this work we introduc a new enhanc crow search algorithm csa name necsa for solv the search problem
then we propos a steganograph approach call steganograph necsa snecsa
it is base on necsa for obtain optim posit and the least signific bit lsb method for conceal secret data in these posit
for gray-scal imag snecsa is appli with 4 lsb
for color imag snecsa is appli in two version
the first one use 3 3 2 lsb while the other use 3 3 2 lsb and permut on each secret byte obtain six pattern and choos the fittest pattern to emb
the practic result show that the propos approach outperform other previous approach with respect to peak signal to nois ratio bit error rate and number of pixel chang where the averag peak signal to nois ratio achiev by the propos approach are approxim 76.25 db 73.47 db and 71 db in gray-scal imag and 83.76 db 80.9 db and 78.7 db in color imag on the test data set
addit the suggest approach show outstand resist to stego-attack such as salt and paper nois and regular and singular analysi .
