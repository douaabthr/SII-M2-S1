impact analysi of platform posit and orient error on warship weapon target strike
in order to evalu the weapon strike effect in the joint of ship format this paper discuss the influenc of platform posit and orient error on weapon strike effect
base on the mathemat model the damag expect of platform posit and orient error the long-rang strike accuraci of shipboard missil and the target indic accuraci of cross-platform are analyz quantit
the model includ weapon strike likelihood the navig posit error model and error transfer model of ship platform
the simul was be perform in matlab environ
the larger the posit and orient error is the more cross platform target sign error will increas
and the acquisit probabl and weapon strike effect of missil long-rang attack will reduc .
