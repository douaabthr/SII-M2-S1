the oyster collect algorithm
this articl focus on the develop of metaheurist algorithm base on the search process and collect of the oyster live or non-liv from the sea bed in the day time
in the coastal belt dure tide oyster are push by the water wave and gather in specif place on the sea bed
for live oyster they are general found in the cold-wat region but for non-liv shell they can be found anywher in the sea bed depend on the blow of the wind and the path of the water wave
sinc oyster have mani econom valu becaus indoor decor ornament and gift pack etc
are made use these sea shell peopl from coastal zone usual collect them and plan for one of the best job trade in their social life
inspir from the natur of the collect procedur of the shell we construct mathemat function of the search path along which it can be avail more
util this procedur into the field of optim we have found some nobl result of a benchmark problem
basic we fit an appropri test function for a benchmark problem then some numer experiment result are comput via oyster collect algorithm
a compar studi has also been made to valid the propos approach
moreov consid the normal of the data we have studi confid interv and analyz statist for the global accept of the method
it is also seen that the root mean squar error rmse for our propos algorithm is 0.004007 and that for the other exist algorithm it becom 0.007015
this give the excel success rate in the field of optim with respect to other all the time
inde the graphic illustr show the efficaci of the propos algorithm and final a conclus is made about keep some scope for futur work .
