sight particl improv swarm optim by make particl awar of their surround
population-bas meta-heurist use particl repres by d dimension point to encod candid solut to an optim problem
the goal of this work is to introduc a new type of particl repres by a d dimension hypercub
our new represent offer a field of view to swarm particl make them awar of their surround
this give each particl it own coverag of the search space
we evalu the effect of our approach in the perform of seven swarm-bas algorithm includ artifici bee coloni cuckoo search optim and particl swarm optim
we use 30 well-known benchmark function and six differ number of dimens
we compar the perform of the algorithm withblindandsightedparticl use mann-whitney test
the result of our extens experi show thatsightedparticl perform at least as well asblindon in 93% of all scenario across differ algorithm benchmark function and number of dimens show signific better result 51% of the time
we also propos a new scale which measur an algorithm s explor and exploit capabl and we use it to explain our result
final we follow asightedswarm throughout the converg process show it abil to cover larg portion of the search space
our take-hom messag is that ani swarm algorithm can adopt our particl represent in order to improv it perform becaus ani method can benefit from improv it exploit and explor capabl .
