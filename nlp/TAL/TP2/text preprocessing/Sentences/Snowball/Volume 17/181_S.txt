a hybrid optim algorithm for energy-awar multi-object task schedul in heterogen multiprocessor system
in order to success address the multiprocessor work schedul issu a novel hybrid approach is present in this paper
execut a group of task on a small number of processor is the main goal of a task schedul method
the job schedul issu is view as a multi-object optimis issu in this studi
the goal of this optimis challeng are to determin the system s least energi consumpt and minimum makespan the sum of the schedul length for each task s execut
in order to lower the processor energi usag the dynam voltag frequenc scale dvfs level has the task schedul issu enabl
to determin the goal a hybrid algorithm call hybrid grey wolf crow search optimis hgwcso is suggest
the grey wolf optimis gwo and crow search optimis cso algorithm are combin to creat the hgwcso algorithm
the social structur and hunt strategi of wolv serv as the inspir for the gwo metaheurist algorithm
the cso on the other hand is a metaheurist algorithm that was motiv by crow clever conduct
the propos hybrid approach is put into practis use task that are produc at random and the result of this comparison are classic method
the propos method s simul result are contrast with those from five exist wide use method
the propos techniqu has also been contrast with some newli creat metaheurist algorithm use various real-world data set
accord to the simul result hgwcso outperform other algorithm in term of lower makespan and energi usag
the propos algorithm has success improv the makespan and energi consumpt with a maximum of 31.07% and 58.36% respect compar to other algorithm .
