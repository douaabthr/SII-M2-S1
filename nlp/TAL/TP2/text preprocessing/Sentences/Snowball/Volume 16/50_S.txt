a generic scheme for cyber secur in resourc constraint network use incomplet inform game
we propos an onlin learn model that effici teach a defend s agent to learn the attack s behavior while interact in the cyber-world
this paper model the interact between these two agent as a stochast game with limit ration
becaus of this limit ration the propos model help the defend s agent learn the unknown communic s behavior from the feedback obtain while interact with it
mani model are built to solv the interact between them by develop a state-ori stochast markov game
howev such model fail due to the state explos problem and therefor this paper discuss a model to solv this game restrict it to a stateless stochast game
the model is then compar to check the perform with differ algorithm that solv stochast game
the comparison between them show that the propos algorithm converg to an optim strategi in a brief simul time span
final our model check the perform with an exist techniqu that show that the propos algorithm choos the correct strategi for around 91% of the simul time compar to 73% of the simul time by the exist algorithm .
