due to the differ between eastern and western cultur mani student often face difficulti in languag learn caus by cultur differ in learn english
adapt in cross-cultur communic and fluenci in languag learn are the highest realm of learn english and the highest pursuit for everi student s learn
to push the dialogu content for student this paper propos a recognit model of multi-input featur extract base on convolut neural network cnn for english emot recognit
the model adopt an end-to-end train method for learn which can simplifi the workflow and improv the overal recognit accuraci
at first a speech is transform into a form more suitabl for model learn spectrogram and mel spectrogram
then it is input into the model for automat featur extract
in the model design the inform of spectrogram in time-domain and frequency-domain is consid at the same time
final the high-level featur of the imag are fuse which great improv the effect of speech emot recognit
experiment result prove that the propos speech emot recognit fusion model has high recognit accuraci and qualiti of experi .
