termit alat optim algorithm a swarm-bas natur inspir algorithm for optim problem
swarm base algorithm play a veri import role in solv optim problem as these algorithm perform better than the tradit techniqu
various such swarm-bas algorithm are develop and experi with by previous research
howev the complex and number of input paramet to be tune are the signific disadvantag for most of these swarm-bas algorithm
in this present studi a new swarm-bas natur inspir algorithm call termit alat optim algorithm taoa is propos base on the phototact activ of a termit alat group
the advantag of this algorithm is it faster converg rate with effect explor and exploit capabl
the algorithm also has a moder number of process paramet and comput complex
to evalu the capabl total 30 benchmark instanc and 5 real-lif problem are solv by this algorithm
apart from the benchmark and real-lif instanc the algorithm is also appli in the flow shop problem to evalu it effect
final a comparison between the result of taoa and other exist algorithm is carri out which valid it abil .
