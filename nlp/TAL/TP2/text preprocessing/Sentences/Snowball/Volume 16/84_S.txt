covid-19 sever detect use machin learn techniqu from ct-imag
covid-19 has spread worldwid and the world health organ was forc to list it as a public health emerg of intern concern
the diseas has sever impact most of the peopl becaus it affect the lung and caus sever breath problem and lung infect
differenti other lung ailment from covid-19 infect and determin the sever is a challeng process
doctor can give vital life-sav servic and support patient live onli if the sever of their condit is determin
this work propos a two-step approach for detect the covid-19 infect from the lung ct imag and determin the sever of the patient s ill
to extract the featur pre-train model are use and by analyz them integr the featur from alexnet densenet-201 and resnet-50
the covid-19 detect is carri out by use an artifici neural network ann model
after the covid-19 infect has been identifi sever detect is perform
for that imag featur are combin with the clinic data and is classifi as high moder low with the help of cubic support vector machin svm
by consid three sever level patient with high risk can be given more attent
the method was test on a public avail dataset and obtain an accuraci of 92.0% sensit of 96.0% and an f1-score of 91.44% for covid-19 detect and got overal accuraci of 90.0% for covid-19 sever detect for three class .
