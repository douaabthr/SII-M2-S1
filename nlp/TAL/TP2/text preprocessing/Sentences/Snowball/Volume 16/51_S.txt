event detect in twitter by deep learn classif and multi label cluster virtual backbon format
the spread of social network site snss has led to the develop of news and it spread
in term of momentum produc content and topic the gather data from onlin servic like twitter are from a wide rang of area
find an abnorm pattern as well as content orient plan in societi is the reason whi event analysi can be of great import
event in social network site is an interest happen in real world which caus discuss on the topic about relat issu by the user of snss like twitter and it is releas immedi after the discuss or with a delay
event chang the amount of textual data in a way that it present relat topic in a specif time period
this event is identifi by time and topic and is relat with entiti like peopl and place
the comput relat to event detect in real time is a big problem in this context
a model base on deep learn is present in this paper
first accord to the label data class are form through classif
later in a flow manner unlabel data are present to the model
the unlabel data are divid into the present class accord to the model which they have been train
if the data are higher than an identifi threshold they are assign to a new class and when the data are lower than the threshold they are categor as temporari event
innov of the propos method is in two issu
first the data in this model are semi-supervis therefor the label data are use in the first phase and the rest of the data are use in the second phase
in han classif phase a modul titl bag of sentenc was produc for exact classif of sentenc and in the second phase the abstract concept of virtual backbon was use to enhanc precis of multi label cluster
ad these two section use the propos method enhanc the precis of classif and purif of the data in unlabel data .
