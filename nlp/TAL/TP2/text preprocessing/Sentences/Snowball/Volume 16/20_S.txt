train rbf network with a hybrid genet algorithm
rbf neural network are well establish tool for classif and regress problem
this articl adapt a hybrid genet algorithm to estim the main paramet of the network
the propos method util a genet algorithm in a conjunct with a local search procedur and a termin rule
the method is test against other rbf variant on a seri of well-known problem from the relev literatur and the result are report .
