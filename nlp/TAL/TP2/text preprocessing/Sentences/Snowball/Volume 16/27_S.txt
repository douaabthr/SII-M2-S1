design of deer hunt optim algorithm for accur 3d indoor node local
indoor local is one of the emerg technolog in locat base servic which find use for commerci as well as civilian industri
global posit system are a familiar solut for outdoor local system
but the presenc of complic obstacl in build pose a major challeng in indoor local
though few indoor local techniqu base on rang and fingerprint base techniqu are devis they are time consum and labori
therefor this paper devis an effici deer hunt optim algorithm with weight least squar estim dhoa-wls techniqu for accur 3d indoor node local techniqu
the propos dhoa-wls techniqu has the abil to accomplish minim local error with least local time
in dhoa-wls techniqu the dhoa is use to estim the primari target locat to elimin the non-lin of sight error
base on the primari locat attain the wlse techniqu is appli to determin the accur target s final locat
in order to valid the 3d indoor local perform of the dhoa-wls techniqu an extens simul analysi is perform and the result are investig in term of differ measur
the simul outcom demonstr the superior perform of the dhoa-wls techniqu over the recent state of art techniqu .
