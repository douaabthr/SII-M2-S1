binari artifici electr field algorithm
artifici electr field algorithm aefa is one of the recent population-bas optim techniqu it is inspir by the electrostat forc theori
this articl aim to design a novel binari version of the aefa scheme to improv the perform of the origin aefa scheme in discret space
the popular s-shape and v-shape function are use to design the binari version of the aefa
the effici and the optim abil of the propos binari version of the aefa are studi theoret as well as experiment
an extens experiment studi is perform to understand the perform of the propos scheme
a set of 24 benchmark problem are solv use binari version of aefa the experiment result are compar with nine state-of-the-art algorithm
the run time complex and wilcoxon s signed-rank statist test are also conduct to judg the propos algorithm
in addit to the experiment studi theoret analysi is also carri out which suggest the converg scenario of the propos scheme
these studi suggest that the design binari version of the aefa are veri effici and compet in address difficult optim problem .
