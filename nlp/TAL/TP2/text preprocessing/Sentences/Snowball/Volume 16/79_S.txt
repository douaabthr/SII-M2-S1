tree optim algorithm toa a novel metaheurist approach for solv mathemat test function and engin problem
this studi present a new metaheurist optim algorithm name tree optim algorithm toa for solv mathemat benchmark function and engin problem
this algorithm which is inspir from the growth of tree start from a random initi popul and improv their perform accord to the growth pattern of tree
inde the purpos of this new optim method is to find the highest leaf of a tree by util the posit of the best leaf and also replac yellow dri leav by new random fresh green one
these strategi prevent the algorithm from the prematur converg and get stuck in local minima
this modern optim method is evalu by solv sever mathemat test function and a real world constrain design problem
the obtain result are compar with those of some promin evolutionari algorithm introduc in the literatur
the numer and simul result verifi the superior of the toa in term of the solut accuraci and the converg speed .
