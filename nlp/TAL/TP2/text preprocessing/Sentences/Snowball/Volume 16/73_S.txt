new local approach base on the develop of a person dynam model for a car-lik vehicl robucar
futur autonom drive and next-gener vehicl control requir further advanc in vehicl dynam state estim
this paper describ a new local approach base on the develop of a person dynam model for an autonom car-lik vehicl call robucar
the propos approach is use within a framework for the develop of a robucar simul platform
this approach is first use offlin due to the comput time constraint employ record odometr data to studi and valid some develop applic relat to the navig function such as obstacl avoid target track etc
howev this approach can be use onlin to obtain a good local in real time by use a power embed system or simplifi some aspect not easili influenc in the propos dynam model
local issu have been discuss while analyz some method use in mobil robot and describ the background and choic made in this paper
use an appropri tire-road contact model dynam equat of the forc and torqu act on the robucar have been determin
the propos dynam model discuss in this paper has 18 degre of freedom dof consid fine technic characterist relat to the electr motion the geometri of the bi-steer system and the tire-road contact type
second the develop dynam model has been exploit to provid the robucar s posit in outdoor environ use odometr measur adjust sever intern paramet
simul are carri out to evalu the behavior of the develop dynam model
furthermor an experiment test has been realiz outdoor for a distanc of 513 m to valid our new local approach
the obtain experiment result are interest and promis show clear the effect of the new approach adopt for local in offlin mode
the accuraci provid by the propos dynam model compar to the kinemat model is highlight
moreov the develop dynam model can be use in sever field other than local such as motion plan control and robucar stabil studi .
