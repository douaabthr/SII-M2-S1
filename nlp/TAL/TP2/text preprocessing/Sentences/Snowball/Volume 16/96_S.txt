multi-region english translat synchron mechan driven by big data
the requir for translat abil are improv to meet the need of the era of big data
sinc translat work involv mani field and each field examin the differ translat abil of translat they can adapt to the develop of this era onli by constant improv their work abil
use the english machin translat system is not onli low-cost and the work qualiti and effici are great improv
in this paper we propos an english translat model base on the lsmt model and the attent mechan to provid fast and accur translat
first we use a set of multipl vector instead of fix dimens to repres sourc languag sequenc
second in the process of generat the target sequenc by dynam select the background vector the translat model pay more attent to the part with high correl with the sourc languag dure the translat process therebi improv the translat perform of the model
third we design a multi-featur fusion method for automat identif of english translat error to improv translat qualiti
final we experiment demonstr that the translat model propos in this paper has good perform .
