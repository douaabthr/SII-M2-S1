a new algorithm for time seri predict use machin learn model
two stage grid search accept as a promis heurist search techniqu involv a search perform in two stage
in the first stage a search is perform in coars grain/low resolut to identifi the optim region and in the second stage a fine grain/high resolut search is perform in the neighborhood of the optim region to identifi the optim paramet
perform a search in two stage consider reduc the comput complex when compar to the basic grid search algorithm
howev an exhaust search is to be carri out in the subspac dure the second stage which may again be a comput expens task
the main contribut of this paper is to develop a new heurist search techniqu which explor the discret paramet space dimens wise recurs
the time complex of the propos algorithm is less than that of the two-stag grid search
the perform of the propos algorithm in term of requir number of probe and time for optim model select compar with the two-stag grid search is verifi for correct and effici .
