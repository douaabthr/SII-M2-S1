automat select algorithm for region of interest of acn face imag compress
everi day million of skin and acn face imag are generat all around the world and compress is the inevit of all such type of imag
acn imag suffer from the problem of poor compress ratio for obtain high peak signal to nois ratio
both peak signal to nois ratio and compress ratio follow an invers relationship
in this paper a new algorithm for acn imag compress is propos
the propos algorithm work in such a way that even a high compress imag would retain all the mandatori inform sinc the region of interest that is necessari for diagnosi retain a signific qualiti and is compress to an optim level
base on the imag s red and green matric an automat select algorithm for the region of interest patch is introduc
the result of the propos algorithm are compar with the convent compress method
a better peak signal to nois ratio of the instruct patch and overal compress ratio are achiev
further the result are compar use differ wavelet function such as haar db2 and bior1 . 3 wavelet
we also investig propos algorithm on other mother wavelet such as coiflet1 and symlet1 and result are found to be superior .
