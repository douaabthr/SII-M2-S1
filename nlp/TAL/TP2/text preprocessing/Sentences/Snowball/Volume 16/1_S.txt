a survey on dragonfli algorithm and it applic in engin
the dragonfli algorithm was develop in 2016
it is one of the algorithm use by research to optim an extens seri of use and applic in various area
at time it offer superior perform compar to the most well-known optim techniqu
howev this algorithm face sever difficulti when it is util to enhanc complex optim problem
this work address the robust of the method to solv real-world optim issu and it defici to improv complex optim problem
this review paper show a comprehens investig of the dragonfli algorithm in the engin area
first an overview of the algorithm is discuss
besid we also examin the modif of the algorithm
the merg form of this algorithm with differ techniqu and the modif that have been done to make the algorithm perform better are address
addit a survey on applic in the engin area that use the dragonfli algorithm is offer
the util engin applic are the applic in the field of mechan engin problem electr engin problem optim paramet econom load dispatch and loss reduct
the algorithm is test and evalu against particl swarm optim algorithm and firefli algorithm
to evalu the abil of the dragonfli algorithm and other particip algorithm a set of tradit benchmark tf1-tf23 were util
moreov to examin the abil of the algorithm to optim large-scal optim problem cec-c2019 benchmark were util
a comparison is made between the algorithm and other metaheurist techniqu to show it abil to enhanc various problem
the outcom of the algorithm from the work that util the dragonfli algorithm previous and the outcom of the benchmark test function prove that in comparison with particip algorithm gwo pso and ga the dragonfli algorithm own an excel perform especi for small to intermedi applic
moreov the congest fact of the techniqu and some futur work are present
the author conduct this research to help other research who want to studi the algorithm and util it to optim engin problem .
