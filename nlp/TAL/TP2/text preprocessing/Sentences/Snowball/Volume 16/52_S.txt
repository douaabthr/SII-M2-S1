mosa/d multi-oper evolutionari many-object algorithm with self-adapt of paramet base on decomposit
in the domain of scienc and engin optim many-object problem have pose great challeng dure the last few year
in respons to this sever algorithm have been propos that includ generic as well as specif approach for problem-solv
this paper propos an improv evolutionari many-object optim emao method mosa/d which is a multi-oper approach with self-adapt of paramet base ondecomposit
it is a generic method base on the framework of the moea/d algorithm and aim to explor the role of an ensembl of differenti evolut oper for optim many-object problem in the decomposit environ
anoth contribut of this studi is the detect of the start of the exploit stage of evolut to enabl the fine-tun of solut
the simul studi involv compar our approach with some select state-of-the-art algorithm on standard test problem have 5 8 10 12 and 15 object space
the experiment result show that the propos mosa/d is overal superior to other approach in term of attain the converg and divers of solut .
