protein remot homolog detect combin pca and multiobject optim tool
protein remot homolog detect prhd is one of the intens research and a complex problem in comput biolog
the object of prhd is to predict the structur and function characterist of un-annot protein sequenc by mean of homolog
two sequenc are said to be homolog if there exist a share ancestri between them
it aim to detect the evolutionari relationship among protein sequenc that are distant locat via comput techniqu
predict of function of protein sequenc are comput intens
featur extract from protein sequenc are too high and presenc of insignific redund featur degrad the perform of comput model with respect to time and cost
henc use princip compon analysi pca the high dimension input matrix was transform into a lower dimens matrix
in the first stage for each protein sequenc 531 physico-chem properti from aaindex databas are consid as featur for homolog detect
the protein sequenc are taken from protein famili from uniprotkb databas
a set of 185 repres featur have been extract from 531 featur use pca
in the second stage nsga ii and nsga iii two power optim techniqu are use to effici search the non-zero eigen space and retriev distinguish eigen vector
this work is test on wide use uniprot and scop benchmark dataset
to check the effici of both the algorithm the control paramet are kept same and numer simul were perform
nsga-iii outperform nsga-ii in the result .
