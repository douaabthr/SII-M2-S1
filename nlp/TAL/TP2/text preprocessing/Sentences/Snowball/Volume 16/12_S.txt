a random-permut base ga for general travel salesman problem in imprecis environ
a random-permut techniqu and the featur of the genet algorithm ga are combin togeth to develop a novel heurist for solv general travel salesman problem
here the random-permut techniqu is use to find the sequenc of cluster of a probabl solut in which a complet tour to be commenc
the featur of ga are use to select the citi from differ cluster of the sequenc
the algorithm has the abil to solv the problem in both the crisp as well as in the imprecis environ
a fuzzi membership-bas select process is propos to select a solut for the mate pool
a general comparison rule of the solut is propos to rank the potenti solut of the popul in imprecis environ
in the crisp environ the effici of the propos approach is test against a set of differ benchmark test problem from gtsplib have size up to 226 citi with 26 cluster
it is observ from the experiment result that the algorithm produc 100% accur result for all the benchmark test problem under consider
imprecis test problem are generat from differ benchmark crisp test problem of tsplib and are use to test the algorithm in the imprecis environ
it is also observ from the experiment result that the propos approach find multipl optim path i. e more than one path if exist for the problem in the crisp as well as in the imprecis environ .
