a novel arithmet optim algorithm base on chaotic map for global optim
chaotic map are effect in develop evolutionari algorithm ea to avoid local optima and speed converg
becaus of this capabl of chaotic map these map have been hybrid with various optim algorithm
in this studi a new optim method base on the combin of chaotic map and arithmet optim algorithm caoa is propos
aoa repres the behavior of four basic arithmet oper
therefor aoa perform the optim process in a wide search space with it mathemat model
therefor aoa has an effect converg capabl
in addit ten differ chaotic map are appli on the aoa
in this studi 7 scenario were creat with chaotic map take into account differ phase of aoa
the propos caoa is test on eighteen benchmark problem
caoa produc success and promis result in solv optim problem compar to origin aoa algorithm
the propos caoa is also compar with the origin aoa
the superior aspect of caoa over aoa are discuss
caoa converg perform is also discuss
the statist signific of the propos hybrid algorithm is test with the wilcoxon sign-rank method .
