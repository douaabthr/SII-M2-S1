a new hybrid optim techniqu base on antlion and grasshopp optim algorithm
this paper propos a new hybrid algorithm that merg the main featur of two well-known metaheurist algorithm grasshopp optim algorithm goa and antlion optim alo algorithm
alo is strong in exploit due to the mechan of antlion in hunt other insect
on the other hand the social forc in goa repres the strong capabl of explor all over the search space
so these featur give the chanc to combin alo and goa in one hybrid algorithm that signific enhanc the perform of both method
the propos hybrid algorithm is test on 32 well-known benchmark test function 13 function of the challeng cec2015 function and two real problem in antenna array synthesi where the element excit amplitud and phase are optim to minim the maximum sidelob level and impos null at specif angl
comparison show that the propos algorithm outperform 18 well-known optim method includ alo and goa in the major of these test with huge differ in some of them which prove the stabil robust and effici of the propos method over other robust algorithm .
