vaccin hesit in the post-vaccin covid-19 era a machin learn and statist analysi driven studi
backgroundth covid-19 pandem has bad affect peopl of all age global
therefor it vaccin has been develop and made avail for public use in unpreced time
howev becaus of various level of hesit it did not have general accept
the main object of this work is to identifi the risk associ with the covid-19 vaccin by develop a prognosi tool that will help in enhanc it accept and therefor reduc the lethal of sars-cov-2 . method the obtain raw vaer dataset has three file indic medic histori vaccin status and post vaccin symptom respect with more than 354 thousand sampl
after pre-process this raw dataset has been merg into one with 85 differ attribut howev the whole analysi has been subdivid into three scenario i medic histori ii reaction of vaccin iii combin of both
further machin learn ml model which includ linear regress lr random forest rf naiv bay nb light gradient boost algorithm lgbm and multilay feed-forward perceptron mlp have been employ to predict the most probabl outcom and their perform has been evalu base on various perform paramet
also the chi-squar statist lr rf and lgbm have been util to estim the most probabl attribut in the dataset that result in death hospit and covid-19 . result for the abov mention scenario all the model estim differ attribut such as cardiac arrest cancer hyperlipidemia kidney diseas diabet atrial fibril dementia thyroid etc . for death hospit and covid-19 even after vaccin
further for predict lgbm outperform all the other develop model in most of the scenario wherea lr rf nb and mlp perform satisfactorili in patch . conclus the male popul in the age group of 50 70 has been found most suscept to this virus
also peopl with exist serious ill have been found most vulner
therefor they must be vaccin in close observ
general no serious advers effect of the vaccin has been observ therefor peopl must vaccin themselv without ani hesit at the earliest
also the model develop use lgbm establish it supremaci over all the other predict model
therefor it can be veri help for the policymak in administr and priorit the popul for the differ vaccin program .
