a new chao cat swarm optim algorithm base on salienc gradient for power equip infrar and visibl imag registr
visibl and infrar imag are import way for the power inspect robot to detect the status of power equip
imag registr can make full use of the advantag of the visibl and infrar imag which can provid a better basi for subsequ state monitor
tradit registr method have the low and poor registr accuraci caus by infrar imag blur
therefor a new chao cat swarm optim algorithm base on salienc gradient is propos to improv the registr accuraci
first base on the visual salienc detect of infrar imag the edg gradient inform of salienc region is enhanc
second the salienc gradient inform and the normal mutual inform are combin as the measur function of registr
third a new chao cat swarm optim algorithm is propos to improv the converg of the imag registr
it use differ chaotic map to improv the step size of the search model
logist chao map is use in the algorithm to chang the locat inform of the cat popul in each iter process to avoid the local optim problem so that the whole popul can reach a balanc between the global search abil and the local search abil which has a good converg speed
final substat inspect imag standard registr test imag set are select for compar experi
the result show that the propos algorithm has good perform in registr rate and registr speed .
