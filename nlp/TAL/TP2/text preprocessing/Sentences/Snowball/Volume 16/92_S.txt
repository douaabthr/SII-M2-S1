metaverse-driven new energi of chines tradit cultur educ edg comput method
how to make chines tradit cultur shine again has becom the focus of our research
the emerg of the metavers has led to further develop of virtual realiti vr technolog
therefor vr technolog can be reli on to creat a vr world in the form of three-dimension interact so that tradit cultur can break through the limit of time and space and deepen peopl s understand of tradit chines cultur
due to the wide applic of edg comput technolog offload vr comput task to edg server can reduc the averag time latenc and improv the user experi
for this reason we design a two-phas task offload algorithm to obtain the optim solut of the task offload problem by implement nash equilibrium
simul result show that the metaverse-driven vr of chines tradit cultur can effect reduc the averag latenc so that user can deepli experi the new energi of chines tradit cultur .
