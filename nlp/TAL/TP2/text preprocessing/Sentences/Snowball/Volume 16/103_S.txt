english text sentiment analysi base on generat adversari network
english text sentiment analysi is an import task in natur languag process nlp
human civil has a long histori and each region has it own uniqu histori of languag develop
by the way languag is constant updat and chang with the develop of the time
especi english is one of the most popular languag in the world
it has a long histori and is wide use in all countri and nation in the world
therefor how to effect recogn the emot of english text through comput technolog is still an urgent problem to be solv
in this paper we propos a generat adversari network gan base method to analyz the english text sentiment
in this method the game between the generat and discrimin from the gan is use to updat the model s understand abil of semant analysi and the emot classif and recognit are realiz through iter train
gan is more like a young child who constant updat his understand of languag by receiv foreign inform in his life
the generat main implement emot analysi and generat a new sentenc which the sentiment is similar to the recognit result
while the discrimin determin whether the input languag is real emot
therefor we first train a sentenc generat to give us some relat possibl sentenc base on our input some refer word
when the network converg we analyz the english text through the sentiment analysi network and then input the analysi result into the sentenc generat network and the output sentenc into the discrimin for judgment
meanwhil the whole process includ text analysi base on big data
when the result generat by the sentiment analysi network and the generat network can deceiv the discrimin the result generat by the network are close to the real sentiment analysi result
our result show that this approach is effect in open data set .
