dynam of three-point boundari valu problem with gudermannian neural network
the present studi articul a novel heurist comput design with artifici intellig algorithm by manipul the model with feed forward ff gudermannian neural network gnn accomplish with global search capabl of genet algorithm ga combin with rapid local converg of active-set method asm i.e. ff-gnn-gaasm for solv the second kind of three-point singular boundari valu problem tps-bvps
the propos ff-gnn-gaasm intellig comput solver integr into the hidden layer structur of ff-gnn system of differenti oper of the second kind of stp-bvps which are link to form the error base merit function mf
the mf is optim with the hybrid-combin heurist of gaasm
the stimul for present this research work come from the object to introduc a reliabl framework that associ the oper featur of nns to challeng with such inspir model
three differ measur of the second kind of tps-bvps is appli to assess the robust correct and use of the design ff-gnn-gaasm
statist evalu through the perform of ff-gnn-gaasm is valid via consist stabil accuraci and converg .
