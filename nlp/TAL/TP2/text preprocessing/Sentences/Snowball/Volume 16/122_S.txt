detect of parkinson s diseas from handwrit use deep learn a compar studi
degen disord such as parkinson s diseas pd have an influenc on daili activ due to rigid of muscl tremor or cognit impair
micrographia speech intens and defici generat of voluntari saccad eye movement pretegiani and optican in front neurol 8 592 2017 are manifest of pd that can be use to devis noninvas and low cost clinic test
in this context we have collect a multimod dataset that we call parkinson s diseas multi-mod collect pdmultimc which includ onlin handwrit speech signal and eye movement record
we present here the handwrit dataset that we call handpdmultimc that will be made public avail
the handpdmultimc dataset includ handwrit sampl from 42 subject 21 pd and 21 control
in this work we investig the applic of various deep learn architectur name the cnn and the cnn-blstm to pd detect through time seri classif
various approach such as spectrogram have been appli to encod pen-bas signal into imag for the cnn model while the raw time seri are direct use in the cnn-blstm
in order to train these model for pd detect on larg scale data various data augment approach for pen-bas signal are propos
experiment result on our dataset show that the best perform for earli pd detect 97.62% accuraci is reach by a combin of cnn-blstm model train with jitter and synthet data augment approach
we also illustr that deep architectur can surpass the model train on pre-engin featur even though the avail data is small .
