mobil intellig termin speaker identif for real-tim monitor system of sport train
mobil intellig termin speaker identif for real-tim monitor system of sport train is present in this manuscript
the purpos of speaker recognit is to use speaker s voic characterist to identifi the speaker s ident
no two peopl in the world have exact the same voic characterist becaus from the perspect of the human physiolog structur differ peopl s vocal shape throat size and other factor relat to pronunci are differ which make it possibl to recogn speech by speech
from the technolog level the propos framework contain the four core aspect name speaker identif motion gestur detect heart rate detect and breath detect
in the inform collect part we adopt the zigbe wifi wireless transmiss gprs data transmiss and bluetooth communic joint framework to captur the accur data to rrealiz the dual-network dual-pass function the td-scdma receiv must also work at the same time when the gsm radio modul of the termin is work
in the speaker identif part we propos the novel deep neural network framework and revis the architectur
the experi compar with the other state-of-the-art model have proven the robust of the propos framework .
