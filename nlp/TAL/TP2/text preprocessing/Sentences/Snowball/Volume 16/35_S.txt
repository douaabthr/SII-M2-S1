solv unconstrain constrain optim and constrain engin problem use reconfigur water cycl algorithm
water cycl algorithm wca is a recent meta-heurist algorithm present to solv various optim problem
wca has receiv critic intrigu from research in differ field
nevertheless the search equat provid in wca is not of adequ explor behavior
in this studi a reconfigur version of the wca is propos the propos algorithm is name as rwca
so as to improv the explor procedur a new posit updat strategi is propos by integr cauchi oper and a greedi select procedur
furthermor in order to promot the exploration-exploit balanc of the rwca algorithm a nonlinear control paramet is propos
the perform of rwca is exhibit on 19 unconstrain benchmark function
statist analysi prove that rwca signific improv the perform of basic wca by provid better solut qualiti faster converg and stronger robust
moreov rwca has been use to solv five constrain numer and three engin applic problem
base on the experi and compar find rwca illustr the adequaci and effect to solv various constrain problem as well as it capabl of provid promis and competit result solv real-world challeng engin problem .
