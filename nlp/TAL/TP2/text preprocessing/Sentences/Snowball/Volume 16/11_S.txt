optim fuzzi base symbiot organ search algorithm for engin design problem
symbiot organ search sos is a novel metaheurist algorithm base on reciproc behaviour of organ in environ by consid three imper relationship such as mutual commens and parasit
the mutual phase of sos algorithm contempl benefit factor bfs which influenc the sos algorithm
in this work two novel approach are introduc to enhanc the compet of sos algorithm to exquisit preserv the balanc between explor and exploit
sine cosin algorithm sca is use to decid relev influenti paramet of sos algorithm such as bfs and further sca optim fuzzi infer system is use for this purpos
the efficaci and effect of propos algorithm are demonstr over other recent propos algorithm by solv benchmark function engin design problem and predict of next day close price of dji market
the propos sca optim fuzzi adapt sos algorithm is substanti with the result which outperform other algorithm hypothet by use wilcoxon rank sum test .
