differenti evolut for linear equal constraint satisfact via unconstrain search in the null space
evolutionari algorithm ea are wide use for a varieti of optim problem most of them with the presenc of constraint
as move oper are usual blind to the constraint i. e
when oper upon feasibl individu they do not necessarili generat feasibl offspr standard ea must be equip with a constraint handl techniqu
this paper focus on exact satisfi the linear equal constraint present in continu optim problem that may also includ addit non-linear equal and inequ constraint
the propos method name deleqc-iii is an extens of two other previous develop method
in this work the origin constrain problem in mathbb r n is transform into a lower-dimension mathbb r n-m unconstrain optim problem whereni the number of variabl andmi the number of linear equal constraint
deleqc-iii perform the search in the null space associ with the linear equal constraint allow the method to exact satisfi such constraint
in order to show the effici of the method scalabl test-problem are use to analyz the perform of the new propos .
