automat estim of differenti evolut paramet use hidden markov model
differenti evolut de has been success in solv practic optim problem
howev similar to other optim algorithm the search perform of de depend on the efficaci of the adopt search oper
the abil to adapt these oper within an evolutionari run enhanc their abil to find better qualiti solut
this adapt process requir learn algorithm capabl of compress the inform embed within a popul into meaning estim to adapt the search oper
hidden markov model hmms are learn algorithm design to estim paramet by compress inform collect from on a state space
in this paper we use hmms to compress the inform within a popul and use the model for adapt the de paramet
the result de-hmm algorithm dynam adjust the two basic paramet of de
after a thorough test of this method and conduct an extens comparison of it perform on the cec2005 and cec2014 dataset it is shown that the propos de-hmm algorithm is abl to achiev better result compar with the classic de and other state-of-the-art method
on averag the algorithm can achiev this perform faster than other method in the literatur .
