survey on evolutionari comput method for cybersecur of mobil ad hoc network
in this paper a comprehens survey of evolutionari comput ec method for cybersecur of mobil ad hoc network manet is present
typic ec method are name base on the natur process inspir them such as swarm intellig e.g. ant coloni optim artifici bee coloni and particl swarm optim evolutionari algorithm e.g. genet algorithm genet program grammat evolut and differenti evolut artifici immun system and evolutionari game analyz strateg interact among differ popul type
we introduc these method with their typic applic and common use algorithm to improv cybersecur within the scope of manet
ongo and speedi topolog chang multi-hop communic non-hierarch organ and power and comput limit are among the intrins characterist of manet caus cybersecur vulner
we describ basic defens mechan in manet for vulner detect attack deterr prevent and recoveri and risk mitig
we classifi princip applic of ec as intrus detect trust manag and cryptographi in cybersecur system to counter measur adversari activ .
