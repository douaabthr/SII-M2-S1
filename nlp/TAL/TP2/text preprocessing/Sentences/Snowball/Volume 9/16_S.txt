toward a new praxi in optinformat target knowledg re-us in evolutionari comput simultan problem learn and optim
as the field of evolutionari optim continu to expand it is becom increas common to incorpor various machin learn approach such as cluster classif and regress model to improv algorithm effici
howev we note that although problem learn is popular use in improv the ongo optim process littl effort is ever made in extract re-us domain knowledg
in other word the acquir knowledg is seldom transfer and exploit for futur design exercis
focus on evolutionari optim in this paper we investig the concept of simultan problem learn and optim inspir by the follow notion 1 that prior/dynam acquir knowledg can enhanc the effect of evolutionari search and 2 that evolut can be gear toward gather crucial knowledg about the under problem
take benchmark function as well as an engin process design problem into consider we demonstr the efficaci of a novel classifier-assist constrain ea toward simultan evolutionari search and problem learn .
