evolv goal-driven multi-ag communic what when and to whom
this paper present an evolutionari approach that given a perform goal produc a communic strategi that can improv a multi-ag system s perform with respect to the desir goal
the evolv strategi determin what when and to whom agent communic
the propos approach further enabl tune the trade-off between the perform goal and communic cost to produc a strategi that achiev a good balanc between the two object accord the system s design need
experi are design to evalu the approach use the wumpus world applic domain with variat of three factor fit paramet includ object weight and action and communic cost fit goal and simul environ
result show that the system s perform can be high tune by control communic and that the present approach has signific util in improv the perform with respect to the goal .
