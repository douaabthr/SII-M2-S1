a new bat echolocation-bas algorithm for singl object optimis
bat sonar algorithm bsa as a swarm intellig approach utilis the concept of echoloc of bat to find prey
howev the algorithm is unabl to achiev good precis and fast converg rate to the optimum solut
with this in mind an adapt bat sonar algorithm is introduc with new paradigm of real bat echoloc behaviour
the perform of the algorithm is valid through rigor test with sever singl object optimis benchmark test function
the obtain result show that the propos scheme outperform the bsa in term of accuraci and converg speed and can be effici employ to solv engin problem .
