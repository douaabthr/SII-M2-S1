popul base ant coloni optim for reconstruct ecg signal
a popul base ant coloni optim algorithm paco for the reconstruct of electrocardiogram ecg signal is propos
specif the paco find a subset of nonzero posit of a spars wavelet domain ecg signal vector that is use for the reconstruct of the signal
a time window is use by the propos paco for fix certain decis of the ant dure the run of the algorithm
the optim behaviour of the paco is compar with various algorithm from the literatur for ecg signal reconstruct and with two random search heurist
experiment result are present for ecg signal from the mit-bit arrhythmia databas
the influenc of sever algorithm paramet and of a local search procedur is evalu
the result show that the propos paco algorithm reconstruct ecg signal with high accuraci .
