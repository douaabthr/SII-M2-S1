improv perform for classif with incomplet data use wrapper-bas featur select
miss valu are an unavoid problem of mani real-world dataset
inadequ treatment of miss valu may result in larg error on classif thus deal well with miss valu is essenti for classif
featur select has been well known for improv classif but it has been seldom use for improv classif with incomplet dataset
moreov some classifi such as c4 . 5 are abl to direct classifi incomplet dataset but they often generat more complex classifi with larger classif error
the purpos of this paper is to propos a wrapper-bas featur select method to improv the abil of a classifi abl to classifi incomplet dataset
in order to achiev the purpos the featur select method evalu featur subset use a classifi abl to classifi incomplet dataset
empir result on 14 dataset use particl swarm optimis for search featur subset and c4 . 5 for evalu the featur subset in the featur select method show that the wrapper-bas featur select is not onli abl to improv classif accuraci of the classifi but also abl to reduc the size of tree generat by the classifi .
