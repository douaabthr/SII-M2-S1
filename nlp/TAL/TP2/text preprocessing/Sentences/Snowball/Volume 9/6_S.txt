reduc project angl for binari tomographi with particl aggreg
this paper extend particl aggreg reconstruct techniqu part a reconstruct algorithm for binari tomographi base on the movement of particl
part suppos that pixel valu are particl and that particl diffus through the imag stay togeth in region of uniform pixel valu known as aggreg
in this work a variat of this algorithm is propos and a focus is place on reduc the number of project and whether this impact the reconstruct of imag
the algorithm is test on three phantom of vari size and number of forward project and compar to filter back project a random search algorithm and to sart a standard algebra reconstruct method
it is shown that the propos algorithm outperform the aforement algorithm on small number of project
this potenti make the algorithm attract in scenario where collect less project data are inevit .
