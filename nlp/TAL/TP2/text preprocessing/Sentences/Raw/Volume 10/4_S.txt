Automatic estimation of differential evolution parameters using Hidden Markov Models
Differential evolution DE has been successful in solving practical optimization problem
However similar to other optimization algorithms the search performance of DE depends on the efficacy of the adopted search operators
The ability to adapt these operators within an evolutionary run enhances their ability to find better quality solutions
This adaptation process requires learning algorithms capable of compressing the information embedded within a population into meaningful estimates to adapt the search operators
Hidden Markov Models HMMs are learning algorithms designed to estimate parameters by compressing information collected from on a state space
In this paper we use HMMs to compress the information within a population and use the model for adapting the DE parameters
The resultant DE-HMM algorithm dynamically adjusts the two basic parameters of DE
After a thorough testing of this method and conducting an extensive comparison of its performance on the CEC2005 and CEC2014 dataset it is shown that the proposed DE-HMM algorithm is able to achieve better results compared with the classical DE and other state-of-the-art methods
On average the algorithm can achieve this performance faster than other methods in the literature .
