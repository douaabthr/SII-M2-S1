Improvement of the performance of the Quantum-inspired Evolutionary Algorithms structures population operators
Population diversity is very important in giving the algorithm the power to explore the search space and not get trapped in local optima
In this respect using a probabilistic representation for the quantum individuals the Quantum-inspired Evolutionary Algorithms QiEA claim higher diversity in the population
Here considering this important feature of QiEA we propose different structures to offer better interaction between the q-individuals and propose new operators to preserve the diversity in the population and thus improve the performance of the QiEA
The effect of the structured population is investigated on the performance of the algorithm
Additionally two operators are proposed in this paper
Being called the Diversity Preserving QiEA the first operator finds the converged similar q-individuals around a local optimum and while keeping the best q-individuals by reinitializing the inferior ones pushes them out of the basin of attraction of the local optimum so helping the algorithm to search other regions in the search space
The other operator is a reinitialization operator which by reinitializing the whole population helps it escape from the local optima it is trapped in
By studying the effect of the parameters of the proposed operators on their performance we show how the proposed operators improve the performance of QiEA
Experiments are performed on Knapsack Trap and fourteen numerical objective functions and the results show better performance for the proposed algorithm than the original version of QiEA .
