Cooperative coevolutionary algorithms for dynamic optimization an experimental study
In this paper we study the cooperative coevolutionary algorithms CCEAs for dynamic optimization
We introduce the CCEAs with two popular types of individuals 1 random immigrants RIs that increase the diversity for changing environments and 2 elitist individuals that increase the local convergence to the optima
The CCEAs are evaluated on a standard suite of benchmark problems and are compared with evolution strategies ES
Our experimental results show that the CCEAs are efficient in locating and tracking optima in dynamic environments
They are superior to the ES when the RI individuals and the elitist individuals are used
In addition we empirically investigate how the CCEAs perform with different parameter settings
These settings include collaboration methods the use of plus comma selections and the number of RI individuals and elitist individuals
We also investigate the CCEAs that use a mutativeσ-self adaptation
The CCEAs perform the best when they use the best collaboration method and the plus selection
The use of the mutativeσ-self adaptation is insignificant
Our results also show that the CCEAs are more scalable than the ES in dynamic environments .
