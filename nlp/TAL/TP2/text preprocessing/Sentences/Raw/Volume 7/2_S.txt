Overview of Harmony Search algorithm and its applications in Civil Engineering
Harmony Search HS a meta-heuristic algorithm conceptualizes a musical process of searching for a perfect state of harmony optimal solution
It allows a random search without initial values and removes the necessity for information of derivatives
Since the HS algorithm was first developed and published in 2001 it has been applied to various research areas and the world wide attention on it has rapidly increased
In this paper applications of HS algorithm in Civil Engineering CE are to be overviewed
Articles in CE areas including water resources structural geotechnical environmental and traffic engineering are to be reviewed thoroughly
As a results variety of application results show that HS can be effectively used as a tool for optimization problems in CE .
