Simultaneous versus incremental learning of multiple skills by modular robots
This paper is concerned with the problem of learning multiple skills by modular robots
The main question we address is whether it is better to learn multiple skills simultaneously all-at-once or incrementally one-by-one
We conduct an experimental study with modular robots of various morphologies that need to acquire three different but correlated skills efficient locomotion navigation towards a target point and obstacle avoidance using a real-time on-board evolution as the learning method
The results indicate that the one-by-one strategy is more efficient and more stable than the all-at-once strategy .
