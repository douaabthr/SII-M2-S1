Towards the evolution of vertical-axis wind turbines using supershapes
We have recently presented an initial study of evolutionary algorithms used to design vertical-axis wind turbines VAWTs wherein candidate prototypes are evaluated under fan generated wind conditions after being physically instantiated by a 3D printer
That is unlike other approaches such as computational fluid dynamics simulations no mathematical formulations are used and no model assumptions are made
However the representation used significantly restricted the range of morphologies explored
In this paper we present initial explorations into the use of a simple generative encoding known as Gielis superformula that produces a highly flexible 3D shape representation to design VAWT
First the target-based evolution of 3D artefacts is investigated and subsequently initial design experiments are performed wherein each VAWT candidate is physically instantiated and evaluated under fan generated wind conditions
It is shown possible to produce very closely matching designs of a number of 3D objects through the evolution of supershapes produced by Gielis superformula
Moreover it is shown possible to use artificial physical evolution to identify novel and increasingly efficient supershape VAWT designs .
