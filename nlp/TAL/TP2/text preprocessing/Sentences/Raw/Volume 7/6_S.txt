Evolutionary robotics
Evolutionary robotics combines evolutionary computing with robotics 1,2 4,7 10
It is a field that aims to apply evolutionary computation techniques to evolve the overall design or controllers or both for real and simulated autonomous robots 9
It is a useful approach both for investigating the design space of robotic applications and for testing scientific hypotheses of biological mechanisms and processes 4 .
