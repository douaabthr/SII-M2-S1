An evolutionary cognitive architecture made of a bag of networks
A cognitive architecture is presented for modelling some properties of sensorimotor learning in infants namely the ability to accumulate adaptations and skills over multiple tasks in a manner which allows recombination and re-use of task specific competences
The control architecture invented consists of a population of compartments units of neuroevolution each containing networks capable of controlling a robot with many degrees of freedom
The nodes of the network undergo internal mutations and the networks undergo stochastic structural modifications constrained by a mutational and recombinational grammar
The nodes used consist of dynamical systems such as dynamic movement primitives continuous time recurrent neural networks and high-level supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms
Edges in the network represent the passing of information from a sending node to a receiving node
The networks in a compartment operate in parallel and encode a space of possible subsumption-like architectures that are used to successfully evolve a variety of behaviours for a NAO H25 humanoid robot .
