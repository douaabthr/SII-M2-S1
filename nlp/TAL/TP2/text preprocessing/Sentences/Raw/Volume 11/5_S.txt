Medical image security enhancement using two dimensional chaotic mapping optimized by self-adaptive grey wolf algorithm
The development of encryption and decryption plays a vital role in the field of security
Recently Chaos-based security has suggested the reliable and efficient way of securing the images
In this paper Self-Adaptive Grey Wolf Optimization GWO is proposed for optimizing 2 dimensional Logistic Chaotic Mapping 2DCM
Further the security analysis of the proposed method is performed using different comparison such as key sensitivity histogram analysis adjacent pixel autocorrelation information entropy attacks quality of encryption Chi square test etc
Moreover analytical outcomes are compared with the conventional algorithms like standard encryption and decryption Genetic Algorithm GA and GWO
The experimental result stated that the proposed method is key sensitive and opposed to the general attacks during the encryption and decryption of images .
