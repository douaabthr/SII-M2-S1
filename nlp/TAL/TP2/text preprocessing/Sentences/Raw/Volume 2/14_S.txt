Adaptive ε-Ranking on many-objective problems
This work proposes Adaptive ε-Ranking to enhance Pareto based selection aiming to develop effectivemany-objective evolutionary optimization algorithms
ε-Ranking fine grains ranking of solutions after they have been ranked by Pareto dominance using a randomized sampling procedure combined with ε-dominance to favor a good distribution of the samples
In the proposed method sampled solutions keep their initial rank and solutions located within the virtually expanded ε-dominance regions of the sampled solutions are demoted to an inferior rank
The parameter ε that determines the expanded regions of dominance of the sampled solutions is adapted at each generation so that the number of best-ranked solutions is kept close to a desired number that is expressed as a fraction of the population size
We enhance NSGA-II with the proposed method and analyze its performance on MNK-Landscapes showing that the adaptive method works effectively and that compared to NSGA-II convergence and diversity of solutions can be improved remarkably on MNK-Landscapes with 3 M 10 objectives
Also we compare the performance of Adaptive ε-Ranking with two representative many-objective evolutionary algorithms on DTLZ continuous functions
Results on DTLZ functions with 3 M 10 objectives suggest that the three many-objective approaches emphasize different areas of objective space and could be used as complementary strategies to produce a better approximation of the Pareto front .
