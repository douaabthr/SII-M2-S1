Evolutionary synthesis of low-sensitivity digital filters using adjacency matrix
An evolutionary synthesis method to generate digital filters with low coefficient sensitivity is presented
The method uses a chromosome coding based on the graph adjacency matrix representation
It is shown that the proposed chromosome representation enables to easily verify and avoid the generation of topologically invalid and non-computable individuals during the evolutionary process
The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is tested in the synthesis of two low-pass digital filters and the results are compared with other examples found in the literature .
