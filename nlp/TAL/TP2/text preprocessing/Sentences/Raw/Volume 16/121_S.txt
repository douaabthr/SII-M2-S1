Mobile intelligent terminal speaker identification for real-time monitoring system of sports training
Mobile intelligent terminal speaker identification for real-time monitoring system of sports training is presented in this manuscript
The purpose of speaker recognition is to use speaker s voice characteristics to identify the speaker s identity
No two people in the world have exactly the same voice characteristics because from the perspective of the human physiological structure different people s vocal shapes throat sizes and other factors related to pronunciation are different which makes it possible to recognize speech by speech
From the technology level the proposed framework contains the four core aspects namely speaker identification motion gesture detection heart rate detection and breath detection
In the information collection part we adopt the ZigBee WIFI wireless transmission GPRS data transmission and Bluetooth communication joint framework to capture the accurate data to rrealize the dual-network dual-pass function the TD-SCDMA receiver must also work at the same time when the GSM radio module of the terminal is working
In the speaker identification part we propose the novel deep neural network framework and revise the architecture
The experiment compared with the other state-of-the-art models have proven the robustness of the proposed framework .
