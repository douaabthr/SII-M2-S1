An improved image clustering algorithm based on Kernel method and Tchebychev orthogonal moments
In this paper we introduce a new clustering algorithm called Improved Kernel Possibilistic Fuzzy C-Means algorithm ImKPFCM based on the kernel method and possibilistic approach
The proposed ImKPFCM algorithm corrects several FCM PFCM and GPFCM algorithms shortcomings reliably detects clustering centers and allows in addition to use Euclidean distance the employment of other more powerful additional norms able to handle various complex situations
In this study we applied ImKPFCM algorithm as a new image clustering method on the basis of Tchebychev orthogonal moments to extract feature vectors and then compared it with FCM PFCM and GPFCM algorithms to evaluate its performance
The comparative study results applied to several image dataset revealed that the ImKPFCM clustering algorithm improves the clustering accuracy over the FCM PFCM and GPFCM methods
Therefore we conclude that the ImKPFCM algorithm is more efficient and produces satisfactory image clustering results .
