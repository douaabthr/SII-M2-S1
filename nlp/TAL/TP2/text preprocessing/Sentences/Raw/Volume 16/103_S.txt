English text sentiment analysis based on generative adversarial network
English text sentiment analysis is an important task in natural language processing NLP
Human civilization has a long history and each region has its own unique history of language development
By the way language is constantly updated and changed with the development of the times
Especially English is one of the most popular languages in the world
It has a long history and is widely used in all countries and nationalities in the world
Therefore how to effectively recognize the emotion of English text through computer technology is still an urgent problem to be solved
In this paper we propose a Generative Adversarial Network GAN based method to analyze the English text sentiment
In this method the game between the generator and discriminator from the GAN is used to update the model s understanding ability of semantic analysis and the emotion classification and recognition are realized through iterative training
GAN is more like a young child who constantly updates his understanding of language by receiving foreign information in his life
The generator mainly implements emotion analysis and generate a new sentence which the sentiment is similar to the recognition results
While the discriminator determines whether the input language is real emotion
Therefore we first train a sentences generator to give us some related possible sentences based on our input some reference words
When the network converges we analyze the English text through the sentiment analysis network and then input the analysis results into the sentence generation network and the output sentences into the discriminator for judgment
Meanwhile the whole process includes text analysis based on big data
When the results generated by the sentiment analysis network and the generation network can deceive the discriminator the results generated by the network are close to the real sentiment analysis results
Our results show that this approach is effective in open data sets .
