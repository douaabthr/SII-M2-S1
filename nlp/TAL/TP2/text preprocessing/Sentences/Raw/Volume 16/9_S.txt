A chance constrained programming model and an improved large neighborhood search algorithm for the electric vehicle routing problem with stochastic travel times
The Electric Vehicle Routing Problem EVRP is an extension to the well-known Vehicle Routing Problem VRP where the fleet consists of electric vehicles which may need to visit recharging stations while servicing the customers due to their battery capacities
This paper solves the Electric Vehicle Routing Problem with Stochastic Travel Times EVRPSTT by proposing a Chance Constrained Programming CCP Model as well as a new scheme based on an Improved Large Neighborhood Search ILS algorithm and a Monte Carlo Sampling MCS procedure
The proposed approach is firstly tested in the deterministic environment using the EVRP benchmark data set where the numerical results show that this approach is able to provide EVRP optimal solutions within a very short computational time for 39 out of 48 used benchmark instances with 20 50 75 and 100 customers
Thereafter to show the efficiency of the proposed approach for solving the CCP model of the EVRPSTT others tests are performed on the same set of instances while taking into consideration a large number of scenarios .
