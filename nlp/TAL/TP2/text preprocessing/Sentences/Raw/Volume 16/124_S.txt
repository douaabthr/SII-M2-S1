Disparity-augmented trajectories for human activity recognition
Numerous methods for human activity recognition HAR have been proposed in the past two decades
Many of these methods are based on sparse representations which describe the whole video content by a set of local features
Trajectories as mid-level sparse features are capable of describing the movements of interest points in two-dimensional 2D space
However 2D trajectories might be affected by viewpoint changes potentially decreasing their accuracies
In this paper we first propose and compare different 2D trajectory-based algorithms for human activity recognition
Then we propose a new way of augmenting 2D trajectories with disparity information without the calculation of the 3D reconstruction
Our obtained HAR results have shown a 2.76% improvement when using disparity-augmented trajectories compared to using classical 2D trajectory information only
Furthermore we have also tested our method on the challenging Hollywood 3D dataset on which we have obtained competitive results at a much faster speed .
