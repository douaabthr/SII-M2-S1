Towards fair machine learning using combinatorial methods
With the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning in the last decade there has been an increasing interest in developing a solid theory and implementing algorithmic fairness which has eventually resulted in a large volume of work over the past few years
Despite the enormous amount of work done on the topic over a concise period there has been little consensus of a unifying theory of algorithmic fairness
In this paper we develop a notion of fairness that is based on the notion of discrepancy of set systems a widely studied topic in the theory of computer science and combinatorics
