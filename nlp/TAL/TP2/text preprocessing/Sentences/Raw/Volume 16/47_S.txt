Vaccine hesitancy in the post-vaccination COVID-19 era a machine learning and statistical analysis driven study
BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has badly affected people of all ages globally
Therefore its vaccine has been developed and made available for public use in unprecedented times
However because of various levels of hesitancy it did not have general acceptance
The main objective of this work is to identify the risk associated with the COVID-19 vaccines by developing a prognosis tool that will help in enhancing its acceptability and therefore reducing the lethality of SARS-CoV-2 . Methods The obtained raw VAERS dataset has three files indicating medical history vaccination status and post vaccination symptoms respectively with more than 354 thousand samples
After pre-processing this raw dataset has been merged into one with 85 different attributes however the whole analysis has been subdivided into three scenarios i medical history ii reaction of vaccination iii combination of both
Further Machine Learning ML models which includes Linear Regression LR Random Forest RF Naive Bayes NB Light Gradient Boosting Algorithm LGBM and Multilayer feed-forward perceptron MLP have been employed to predict the most probable outcome and their performance has been evaluated based on various performance parameters
Also the chi-square statistical LR RF and LGBM have been utilized to estimate the most probable attribute in the dataset that resulted in death hospitalization and COVID-19 . Results For the above mentioned scenarios all the models estimates different attributes such as cardiac arrest Cancer Hyperlipidemia Kidney Disease Diabetes Atrial Fibrillation Dementia Thyroid etc . for death hospitalization and COVID-19 even after vaccination
Further for prediction LGBM outperforms all the other developed models in most of the scenarios whereas LR RF NB and MLP perform satisfactorily in patches . Conclusion The male population in the age group of 50 70 has been found most susceptible to this virus
Also people with existing serious illnesses have been found most vulnerable
Therefore they must be vaccinated in close observations
Generally no serious adverse effect of the vaccine has been observed therefore people must vaccinate themselves without any hesitation at the earliest
Also the model developed using LGBM establishes its supremacy over all the other prediction models
Therefore it can be very helpful for the policymakers in administrating and prioritizing the population for the different vaccination programs .
