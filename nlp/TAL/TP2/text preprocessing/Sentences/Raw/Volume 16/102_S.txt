Big data-driven english teaching for social media a neural network-based approach
Big data and intelligence artificial have greatly broadened the channels for people to acquire knowledge
The practical application of artificial intelligence technology in college English classrooms can not only help teachers prepare more scientific and advanced teaching plans and also effectively improve the quality of college English teaching
In this paper we employ deep neural networks to design a big data-driven English teaching improvement scheme
The proposed method can help teachers and students improve teaching strategies and assist students to learn more accurately and efficiently
First we analyze the current deficiencies and reasons in English teaching
Second we analyze the application of artificial intelligence in text corpus construction
Third we use neural networks to design an intelligent face recognition system for teachers to improve the attendance rate
Forth by analyzing the students writing we design a writing scoring method based on the neural network model which can evaluate students writing content
Finally we experimentally evaluate and verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in this paper .
