CyberNet a hybrid deep CNN with N-gram feature selection for cyberbullying detection in online social networks
Cyberbullying is an experience that creates negative impact on individuals
Because of the beginning of the social networking cyberbullying becomes serious issue
State of art machine learning based approaches outperforms to provide the maximum accuracy at character level detection of abusive words causes cyberbullying
To achieve the prominent accuracy in this paper we adopted the deep learning mechanism with seven layered convolutional neural network CNN model with N-gram feature selection named as hybrid deep CNN HDCNN
By utilizing this model in four staged architectures the word level and character level cyberbullying detections performs effectively
Even though the attackers creating the negative impact on social networking using variety of uncategorized and abusive words
To solve this problem this research work majorly focusing on synonym-character level cyberbullying detection which is referred as CyberNet model here after
The proposed CyberNet model trained with synonym of all words with characters to prevent malicious user from sending cyberbullying text in no possible way
Experimental results conducted on real world dataset the qualitative result analysis proves that the proposed approach provides much better performance compared to the conventional approaches .
