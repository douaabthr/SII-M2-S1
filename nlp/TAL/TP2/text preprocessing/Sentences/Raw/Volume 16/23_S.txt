Cat hunting optimization algorithm a novel optimization algorithm
This article introduces a new version of cat behavior in hunting
Cat Hunting Optimization CHO algorithm Unlike cat optimization algorithms search strategy is not limited to tracking and attacking
The CHO algorithm has various behaviors such as changing the nature of the search from global to local creating the number of positions based on the merit of a point for the cat to roam searching between the optimal space and the current solution search strategy at the gravity point of the solution and so on
The advantage of the proposed algorithm over the standard cat algorithm is that the answers do not attack the prey quickly and this provides a chance to find more efficient solutions in the global search
In the proposed method for intelligent search the problem space of the search radius around the optimal solutions changes in a new way based on trigonometric relations such as cosine
The CHO algorithm considers a kind of individual learning between cats and experienced cats inspire young cats to identify optimal solutions
Experiments on a set of standard benchmark functions show that in most of the functions the optimal calculation error of the CHO is less than SHO GOA GWO FA DE PSO COA algorithms
Implement on the Experiments show that in the most exam the CHO has the first rank in terms of the accuracy of the global optimal calculation in the Frieden test
The CHO algorithm offers less cost in solving engineering optimization problems than WOA LDF and HHO algorithms .
