Fast partial image encryption with fuzzy logic and chaotic mapping
The proposed technique offers an automated image encryption as an alternate to the manual selective encryption of color images
Fuzzy rules based on color details are applied to select the area to encrypt
It can be used for secure communication of sensitive parts of the image without disturbing the remaining part of the image
Strength of this algorithm is its speed immunity to differential attacks and entropy
It is six times faster as compared to the normal encryption
This algorithm is more suitable for satellite images and medical images
It finds an application in the area of information security and data forensics where images are larger in size .
