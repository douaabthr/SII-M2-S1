COVID-19 severity detection using machine learning techniques from CT-images
COVID-19 has spread worldwide and the World Health Organization was forced to list it as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern
The disease has severely impacted most of the people because it affects the lung and causes severe breathing problems and lung infections
Differentiating other lung ailments from COVID-19 infection and determining the severity is a challenging process
Doctors can give vital life-saving services and support patients lives only if the severity of their condition is determined
This work proposed a two-step approach for detecting the COVID-19 infection from the lung CT images and determining the severity of the patient s illness
To extract the features pre-trained models are used and by analyzing them integrated the features from AlexNet DenseNet-201 and ResNet-50
The COVID-19 detection is carried out by using an Artificial Neural Network ANN model
After the COVID-19 infection has been identified severity detection is performed
For that image features are combined with the clinical data and is classified as High Moderate Low with the help of Cubic Support Vector Machine SVM
By considering three severity levels patients with high risk can be given more attention
The method was tested on a publicly available dataset and obtained an accuracy of 92.0% sensitivity of 96.0% and an F1-Score of 91.44% for COVID-19 detection and got overall accuracy of 90.0% for COVID-19 severity detection for three classes .
