Automatic vehicle detection system in Day and Night Mode challenges applications and panoramic review
Vehicle Detection and Recognition is a challenging move in the field of Traffic Management as it requires special attention and technique for the efficient management of vehicles
Vehicle Recognition and classification is a critical application of Intelligent Transport System ITS
It is a process of identifying the moving vehicle on the road to analyze the flow rate and then accurately classify different objects
Lately building an automatic onboard driver assistance system to assist drivers about possible collisions and clashes has received immense significance
Many researchers have proposed different methodologies using different source inputs to detect day and night vision vehicles
However vehicle detection at night is an uphill task
It involves testing of classification algorithm under various factors such as Rainy weather Snowy weather Low illumination etc . due to which identification of vehicle becomes a difficult task
This paper presents a comprehensive panorama of the work done so far by the researchers in vehicle detection day and night time
Various vehicle detection methods are discussed along with the role of ITS in the application of vehicle detection and recognition
Also it provides a concise review of the reported methods used for recognizing different types of vehicles in different environments and challenges faced by other researchers in their research area .
