Scenario-based passengers evacuation optimization with multiple travel modes in transit terminal
The transit terminal is densely populated places with limited road and parking capacity
The contradiction between supply and demand will reduce the evacuation efficiency of passengers arriving the transit terminal
This paper considers the evacuation capacity of multiple travel modes on the arriving passengers at the transit terminal at the same time regards multiple travel modes as a whole and coordinates the transport capacity of various modes
A bi-objective model is proposed
The first objective is minimizing the evacuation cost while the second objective is minimizing the number of passengers transferred
The proposed bi-objective model is transformed into a single-objective one by linear weighted method
The transformed model is essentially a mixed-integer linear programming which is solved by LINGO
To validate the validity of the proposed model a case study of Beijing West Railway Station is presented
The results indicate this proposed methodology is rational and effective and can help passenger evacuation in practical application .
