Heart failure recognition using human voice analysis and artificial intelligence
Heart failure HF is a clinical syndrome that disables the heart from pumping blood to effectively nourish the body or does it to elevated intracardiac pressures
Currently the main diagnostic methods for this pathology are performed clinically by the measurement of biomarkers such as B-type natriuretic peptide BNP and by cardiac imaging methods
As cardiovascular diseases are the primary causes of premature death new technologies to identify these diseases at an early stage are of great importance
Thus this research presents the development of two artificial neural networks ANNs one for each gender that recognize the vocal distortions caused by HF in an individual
Therefore the voices of 142 individuals were collected separated by sex and age
Among these 142 84 voices of people already diagnosed with HF were collected at the Heart Institute of Sao Paulo University INCOR USP and the Metropolitan Hospital of Paraiba
Also the voices of 58 healthy individuals were collected in an extra-hospital environment
Then the following techniques were applied to extract the signals features statistical analysis FFT discrete wavelet transform and Mel-Cepstral analysis
The selected features were used to develop ANNs that aim to identify HF
Both ANNs achieved an efficiency of 96.7%
Also values of 91.86% 88.1% and 92.1% were obtained for accuracy sensitivity and specificity respectively
Therefore comparing the results reached by this research to other studies in the field it is possible to conclude that the use of voice analysis represents a great improvement in HF recognition and early treatment .
