Communication efficiency optimization in federated learning based on multi-objective evolutionary algorithm
Federated learning is an emerging technology that can effectively safeguard personal information
As opposed to traditional centralized learning federated learning can avoid data sharing while maintaining global model training
However in the process of updating the global model it will consume huge client communication resources which hinder the wide application of this technology
To reduce the communication overhead without seriously reducing the accuracy of the global model under the federated learning framework we use decomposition based multi-objective optimization algorithm MOEA/D to optimize the structure of the global model
For the structure of the global model a highly scalable coding method is used for coding which improves the efficiency of the evolutionary neural network
As a comparison we use the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II NSGA II to optimize the problem under the same conditions and verify the effectiveness of both algorithms according to the obtained Pareto solution
We verify that MOEA/D has better convergence when using multilayer and convolutional neural networks as the global model
Overall MOEA/D can further strengthen the structure optimization of the federated learning model and reduce communication costs .
