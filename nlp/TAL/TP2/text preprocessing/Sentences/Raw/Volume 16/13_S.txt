Inverse problem based multiobjective sunflower optimization for structural health monitoring of three-dimensional trusses
AbstractTruss-type structures are widely used in engineering with several applications in different sectors such as construction aeronautics/aerospace telecommunications and energy fields
In all these situations they are generally large-scale structures posing difficulties to take advantage of some direct inspection techniques to locate and identify structural damage
In case these inspections are not performed properly the likelihood of occurrence of accidents will be very high
In this sense structural health monitoring techniques based on the use of optimization algorithms appear as a promising and non-destructive methodology
In this study an inverse damage identification problem is formulated and solved in order to identify damages in large-scale lattice-type structures
The direct problem is numerically formulated using finite element method considering a 72 bar truss where the modal response is obtained
A recent new metaheuristic SunFlower Optimization algorithm is used to solve the inverse damage problem formulated in terms of multiple damage sites and two independent objective functions based on natural frequencies and mode shapes
Numerical results have shown that the inclusion of mode shapes in a multiobjective formulation improves the ability to accurately identify the damage in terms of its location and severity
