A hybrid approach to talent demand forecast in the IT industry modelling and empirical analysis
This study proposes a hybrid grey model to forecast the talent demand of the Chinese IT industry
Such new approach combines advantage of fitting with the Holt s linear trend system and GM 1 1
A comparison of the results generated the exponential smoothing system GM 1 1 and the hybrid grey model are shown to validate the correctness of the fitting
As a consequence the hybrid grey model has the minimum value of RMSE among the three and demonstrates a distinct forecasting characteristic when compared to the effect of a single approach of the exponential smoothing and GM 1 1
Furthermore the hybrid grey model forecasts that the Chinese IT industry s talent would expand at a pace greater than 6.68% annually between 2021 and 2025 with an average annual growth of 381,400
Additionally the statistics indicate the demand for talent will approach 6,700 000 by 2025
The forecast approach derived from the hybrid grey system in particular is projected to provide a suitable platform for strategic planning specialist designation and personnel training of IT talents .
