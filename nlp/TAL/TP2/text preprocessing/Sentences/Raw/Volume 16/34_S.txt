A novel collaborative filtering based recommendation system using exponential grasshopper algorithm
Collaborative filtering recommends items on the principle of similarity
The effectiveness of the similarity is highly dependent on the performance of the clustering algorithm
This paper presents a new clustering-based collaborative filtering method for efficient item recommendation
The new approach introduces a new variant of the grasshopper optimization algorithm to determine optimal similarity patterns
Nine nature-inspired algorithms have been considered and tested against seventeen standard benchmark functions in terms of mean fitness value and the Friedman test to validate the proposed variant experimentally
Further the efficacy of the new clustering-based collaborative filtering method is tested on the publicly available MovieLens dataset and evaluated in terms of mean absolute error precision and recall over the different cluster settings
The obtained results are compared against nine clustering-based collaborative filtering methods
Experiments affirm that the proposed method is a permissive technique for the recommendation on large-scale datasets .
