Data driven intelligent action recognition and correction in sports training and teaching
With the development of world economy sports development has also become a symbol of national strength
Nowadays sports competition has become an important activity for all countries to show their strength and also an important bridge to connect all countries and build friendship
In the process of challenging the limit human beings gradually master the action essentials of various sports and the action difference of athletes directly affects the grades of the competition
Therefore in the process of sports training athletes of various countries will focus on the standard of action of each athlete
In traditional sports training veteran athletes with rich experience are usually used as coaches to guide athletes empirically
However the difference of coaches will also lead to the difference of sports effects
At the same time coaches grasp of athletes action standards is more based on subjective observation which cannot be accurately measured so there may be large differences and errors in their grasp of action standards
In this paper we propose an intelligent action recognition and correction system to assist coaches to measure and evaluate athletes actions more accurately and give correction suggestions according to standard actions
Our system uses RGB-D sensors to analyze athletes skeleton key points in real time
The different between the athlete s action and the standard action is calculated through the connection between the joint key points
In this paper we also use the timing tracking algorithm to comprehensively evaluate the consistency of the action with the standard
We verified the feasibility of the recognition correction system through the actual movement and measurement of athletes
The experiment shows that our system can accurately measure the movements of athletes and has more accurate measurement results and correction suggestions than the traditional coach naked eye measurement .
