A new fission fusion behavior-based Rao algorithm FFBBRA for solving optimization problems
There are various problems in the engineering field which can be modeled as an optimization problem and can be solved through metaheuristic optimization algorithms
In this paper a new metaheuristics algorithm named as Fission Fusion Behavior-based Rao Algorithm FFBBRA has been proposed
This new algorithm utilizes the concepts of metaphor-less Rao algorithm and the idea of fission fusion social behavior of Spider Monkey Optimization SMO
The proposed methodology divides the entire population into subpopulations and then these subpopulations are independently updated concerning their local worst and global best candidates using the FFBBRA equations
The proposed method has been tested over 20 unconstrained functions including multimodal unimodal and fixed dimensions benchmark functions along with 2 constrained benchmark functions
The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated through observations of the worst solution the best solution standard deviation and mean solution
Convergence analysis is also performed
The proposed FFBBRA has shown good performance as observed by Friedman Test
This proposed algorithm is also easily utilized on parallel systems due to its parallel working nature .
