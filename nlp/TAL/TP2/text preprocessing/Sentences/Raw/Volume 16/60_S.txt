A novel arithmetic optimization algorithm based on chaotic maps for global optimization
Chaotic maps are effective in developing evolutionary algorithms EAs to avoid local optima and speed convergence
Because of this capability of chaotic maps these maps have been hybridized with various optimization algorithms
In this study a new optimization method based on the combination of chaotic maps and arithmetic optimization algorithm CAOA is proposed
AOA represents the behavior of four basic arithmetic operators
Therefore AOA performs the optimization process in a wide search space with its mathematical model
Therefore AOA has an effective convergence capability
In addition ten different chaotic maps are applied on the AOA
In this study 7 scenarios were created with chaotic maps taking into account different phases of AOA
The proposed CAOA is tested on eighteen benchmark problems
CAOA produces successful and promising results in solving optimization problems compared to original AOA algorithm
The proposed CAOA is also compared with the original AOA
The superior aspects of CAOA over AOA are discussed
CAOA convergence performance is also discussed
The statistical significance of the proposed hybrid algorithm is tested with the Wilcoxon sign-rank method .
