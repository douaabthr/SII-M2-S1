Basketball assisted teaching in instructional videos based on Mobile Edge Computing
Many teachers are limited by the teaching contents in physical education which makes it impossible to show students some skilled movements so students do not have enough time to learn about those abstract and challenging to understand running positions and skills
Especially in basketball teaching if students do not have promising sports talents and solid basic basketball skills it is not easy to acquire more basketball skills in physical education courses
Therefore teaching through video has become inevitable
However with the growth of video services traditional cloud computing methods cannot meet the requirements of low latency tasks such as basketball teaching videos
Hence Mobile Edge Computing MEC comes into being
Specifically by introducing the end-edge-cloud system collaborative architecture a cache strategy of simulated annealing algorithm for extended short-term memory networks is proposed
The simulation results show that the proposed caching strategy can effectively reduce transmission latency improve the quality of basketball teaching make it easier for students to get basketball skills and significantly improve students basketball skills when the ends used by students move between different MEC servers under the collaborative architecture of the end-edge-cloud system .
