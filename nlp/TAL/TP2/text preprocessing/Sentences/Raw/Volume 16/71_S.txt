Adult content image recognition by Boltzmann machine limited and deep learning
Adult content images have a detrimental effect on Internet users a significant number of whom are minors
Therefore it is essential to control and detecting adult content images using multimedia processing and computer vision techniques
Previous studies have typically focused on manual-engineered visual features that may be difficult to detect and analyze
This paper presents a new model that employs deep convolutional neural networks within a Gaussian-Bernoulli limited-time for adult content image recognition of a wide variety in a precise and effective manner
There are various layers within Convolutional Neural Networks for feature extraction and classification
Gaussian-Bernoulli limited-time was used for feature extraction to describe the images and these features were summarized using the Boltzmann machine limited in the feature summary phase
The benefit of such an approach is convenience in carrying out feature extraction
Additionally when tested on the most modern criterion dataset this finding is believed to be more precise compared to other state-of-the-art approaches
The results obtained prove that the proposed approach leads to a higher efficiency .
