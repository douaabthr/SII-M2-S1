Classification model for meticulous presaging of heart disease through NCA using machine learning
For the design and implementation of Clinical decision support system computation time and prognostic accuracy are very important
To analyze the large collection of a dataset for detecting and diagnosis disease machine learning techniques are used
According to the reports of World Health Organizations heart disease is a major cause of death and killer in urban and rural areas or worldwide
The main reason for this is a shortage of doctors and delay in the diagnosis
The outcome presaging of this disease is a very challenging job
This proposed work used the approach of self-diagnosis algorithm fuzzy artificial neural network and NCA and PCA and imputation methods
By the use of this technique reduces the computation time for prediction of Coronary heart disease
For the implementation of this the two datasets are using such as Cleveland and Statlog datasets
In this research work heart disease is a diagnosis by used the clinical parameters of patients for early stages
Classifiers used for that random forest algorithm ANN and K-NN algorithm
The datasets for the disease prediction measure are used to accurately calculate the difference between variables and to determine whether they are correlated or not
For this classification model the performance measure is calculated in requisites of their accuracy precision recall and specificity
This approach is evaluated on the heart disease datasets for improving the accuracy performance results obtained
The experimental results obtained by NCA provide greater performance in terms of performance metrics for the multiple classifiers like RF DT NB SVM
The aim of this study to develop the classification model as well as show a comparative analysis between existing systems is discussed
In this paper for Cleveland dataset has taken 303 instances and 14 attributes are used
This dataset has preprocessed dataset
This paper depicts the higher accuracy score with the multiple classifiers such as Random forest SVM and NB using NCA is 99.34 and for DT is 98
Overall NCA is best in terms of classification accuracy
The result shows not only accuracy for the proposed method but obtains better results for multiple classifiers that exhibit their reliability . in medical science this approach is used to predict heart disease at its early stages . The outcome for KNN SDA NCA Fuzzy ANN for Cleveland dataset accuracy achieved 98.56% and for Statlog dataset 98.66%
This result describes the hybrid method used for prediction of heart disease and achieved better results .
