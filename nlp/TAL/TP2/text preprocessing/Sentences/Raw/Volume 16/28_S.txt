A hybrid metaheuristic method for solving resource constrained project scheduling problem
Resource constrained project scheduling problem RCPSP is a renowned variant of the scheduling problem
RCPSP is very important in production and management but computationally hard
It is widely used in many fields like job shop scheduling flow shop scheduling transactional planning wireless communication etc
The objective of solving RCPSP is to obtain minimum makespan maintaining all constraints
There are some exact approximate heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms which were proposed to solve this problem
RCPSP is an NP-hard problem
Chemical reaction optimization CRO is a population based metaheuristic method to solve such problems and it shows better performance comparing with some other existing algorithms
CRO explores the large search space both locally and globally using its four operators
Genetic algorithm GA is also a nature inspired algorithm which is used to solve various optimization problems
In this paper we are proposing a hybrid metaheuristic approach that integrates chemical reaction optimization CRO and genetic algorithm GA named CRO-GA to solve RCPSP
We have redesigned the basic operators of CRO and GA to find out the solutions
An additional operator called priority based selection operator is used in CRO to adjust with GA
Our proposed method is compared with other related approaches such as adaptive particle swarm optimization A-PSO multi agent optimization algorithm MAOA artificial bee colony ABC genetic algorithm GA which are state of the art for the RCPSP
The experimental results show that our proposed methodology gives better results than other existing algorithms to solve RCPSP with less computational time .
