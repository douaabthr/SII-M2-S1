Introduction to the special issue on evolutionary intelligence in games
This issue includes three papers selected from those presented to the EvoGames track within the EvoStar 2013 conference Esparcia-Alcázar2013
All authors with a paper accepted in that conference were invited and then an open call was made to anybody working in the topic of evolutionary intelligence in games
After the authors submitted an extended version a selection was made and these three papers were accepted after two rounds of revision . The three papers represent a wide range of games and puzzles a relatively recent trading-card game Dominion Mahlmann et al . 2012 which was created by Donald Vacarino and published by Rio Grande Games in 2008 a classic platform game Super Mario Togelius et al . 2009 and a board game MasterMind which is actually a puzzle proposed initially in the 70s by a telecommunication engineer and whose first solution was proposed by Donald Knuth a few years later Knuth1976 77 . The first paper by Ransom Winder 2014 is the one that tries to find a winning deck of ten cards for the Dominion game in fact the problem that is tackled is to try and predict the game states to make decisions about the next move
Neural networks are applied to the state of the game when the player has to make any decision and these neural networks have to be trained so that the outcome of these decisions is as favorable to the player as possible
Several methods have been tried and an evolutionary-algorithm based game bot is the only one that obtains an edge over classical strategies . The second paper also combines evolutionary algorithms with other algorithms in this case Finite State Automata to evolve in this case strategies for advancing a Super Mario avatar in platforms of increasing difficulty Mora et al . 2014
This game has been traditionally used for computational intelligence competitions FSM are also traditionally used to drive game bots in strategy and first person shooter games
But designing them can be tricky and an evolutionary algorithm that designs the transitions between states is successfully used in this paper for a Mario that is able to obtain good results up to a high level besides a study is made on the population needed to obtain good results in each level . The final paper is more purely evolutionary Maestro-Montojo et al . 2014 in the sense that it does not combine evolutionary techniques with others in order to solver the MasterMind game a puzzle in which a secret combination must be found with the help of hits given as response to every move made by a player
The paper approaches this problem from two different angles first evolving populations of combinations scores according to the hints made and then using genetic programming to evolve good scoring methods for these combinations that have traditionally been chosen heuristically . Summing up this special issue includes a diverse set of papers that use evolutionary algorithms to find solutions to a wide range of games combining them with other techniques such as neural nets or finite state automata .
