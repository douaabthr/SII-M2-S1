On evolutionary subspace clustering with symbiosis
Subspace clustering identifies the attribute support for each cluster as well as identifying the location and number of clusters
In the most general case attributes associated with each cluster could be unique
A multi-objective evolutionary method is proposed to identify the unique attribute support of each cluster while detecting its data instances
The proposed algorithm symbiotic evolutionary subspace clustering S-ESC borrows from symbiosis in the sense that each clustering solution is defined in terms of a host single member of the host population and a number of coevolved cluster centroids or symbionts in an independent symbiont population
Symbionts define clusters and therefore attribute subspaces whereas hosts define sets of clusters to constitute a non-degenerate solution
The symbiotic representation of S-ESC is the key to making it scalable to high-dimensional datasets while an integrated subsampling process makes it scalable to tasks with a large number of data items
Benchmarking is performed against a test suite of 59 subspace clustering tasks with four well known comparator algorithms from both the full-dimensional and subspace clustering literature EM MINECLUS PROCLUS STATPC
Performance of the S-ESC algorithm was found to be robust across a wide cross-section of properties with a common parameterization utilized throughout
This was not the case for the comparator algorithms
Specifically performance could be sensitive to the particular data distribution or parameter sweeps might be necessary to provide comparable performance
An additional evaluation is performed against a non-symbiotic GA with S-ESC still returning superior clustering solutions .
