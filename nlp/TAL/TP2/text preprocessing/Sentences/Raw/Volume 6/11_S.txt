Improved thresholding based on negative selection algorithm NSA
Thresholding is a tool of image segmentation which groups the pixels in a logical way
In this paper a novel algorithm based on negative selection algorithm a model of artificial immune system is proposed for image thresholding
The proposed algorithm is applied on the thresholded images of lathe tool produced using maximum information entropy MIE and global thresholding based technique resulting in an improved image
To verify the algorithm and results it has also been applied on some of the inbuilt MATLAB MATrix LABoratory images
Histogram is employed to analyze the results
Further the results of improved algorithm are compared with the results of MIE and the global thresholding methods to check the effectiveness of the proposed method
The experimental results confirm the potential of the developed algorithm .
