Emperor Penguins Colony a new metaheuristic algorithm for optimization
A metaheuristic is a high-level problem independent algorithmic framework that provides a set of guidelines or strategies to develop heuristic optimization algorithms
Metaheuristic algorithms attempt to find the best solution out of all possible solutions of an optimization problem
A very active area of research is the design of nature-inspired metaheuristics
Nature acts as a source of concepts mechanisms and principles for designing of artificial computing systems to deal with complex computational problems
In this paper a new metaheuristic algorithm inspired by the behavior of emperor penguins which is called Emperor Penguins Colony EPC is proposed
This algorithm is controlled by the body heat radiation of the penguins and their spiral-like movement in their colony
The proposed algorithm is compared with eight developed metaheuristic algorithms
Ten benchmark test functions are applied to all algorithms
The results of the experiments to find the optimal result show that the proposed algorithm is better than other metaheuristic algorithms .
