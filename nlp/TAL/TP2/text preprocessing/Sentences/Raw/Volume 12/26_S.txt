Removal of rain video based on temporal intensity and chromatic constraint of raindrops
An improved algorithm of frame time difference is proposed and applied to raindrops removal of video image . This paper analyzes the temporal intensity waveform and chromatic constraint properties of raindrops and the method is optimized by these two properties
We make use of the difference between rain and non-rain moving objects in the pixels intensity changes which realized a broad classification between the rain and non-rain moving object pixel
The candidate raindrops pixels are optimized in combination with the chromatic constraint property
The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has a better effect of rainy day in video image restoration than Garg s and it is simple and effective
The algorithm has a strong applicability and it can be further used for many applications such as air pollution control management outdoor surveillance remote sensing and intelligent vehicles .
