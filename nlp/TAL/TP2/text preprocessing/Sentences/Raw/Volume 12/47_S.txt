UCRLF unified constrained reinforcement learning framework for phase-aware architectures for autonomous vehicle signaling and trajectory optimization
Signaling and trajectory optimization work as contention and researchers have debated on what should be the best for the vehicle but it seems that both components are complement to each other and there can be combined situations with bounds where maximum optimization can be achieved
This paper introduces a novel approach called Phase-Aware Deep Learning and Constrained Reinforcement Learning for optimization and constant improvement of signal and trajectory for autonomous vehicle operation modules for an intersection
It deals with all the components required for the signaling system to operate communicate and also navigate the vehicle with proper trajectory so that it faces less waiting time and the overall system operates with minimum waiting time and comparable throughput rate
We have done analysis on the operating time and the vehicle movement as these are vital for pollution and energy consumption
Our methodologies are not only efficient in time and computation but also have incorporated highly optimized data representation to reduce the overhead of maintaining and accessing the data
This ensures very efficient time complexity and theoretical computation time and better lower bounds
Constrained Reinforcement Learning concept is the main contribution of this work and it helped in decreasing 84% of the waiting time for the vehicles .
