Future search algorithm for optimization
This paper proposes a new optimization algorithm named future search algorithm FSA
This algorithm mimics the person s life
People in the world search for the best life
If any person found that his life is not good he tries to change it and he imitates the successful persons
According to this behavior this algorithm is built by mathematical equations
The FSA can update the random initial
Furthermore it uses the local search between people and the global search between the histories optimal persons to achieve the best solutions
The proposed algorithm does not have tuned parameters
In addition it has low computational complexity fast convergence and high local optima avoidance
The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by applying it to solve some benchmarks test functions
These test functions have various characteristics necessary to evaluate the FSA
In addition the performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with five other well-known methods
The results confirm a better performance of the proposed algorithm to get the optimal solution with fewer iterations number than other methods .
