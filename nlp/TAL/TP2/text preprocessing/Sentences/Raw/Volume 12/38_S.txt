DM-LIMGA Dual Migration Localized Island Model Genetic Algorithm a better diversity preserver island model
Island Model Genetic Algorithm IMGA is a multi-population based GA
IMGA aimed to avoid local optimum by maintaining population island diversity using migration
There are several mechanisms of migration and individual selection such as the best or worst individual selection new naturally inspired evolution model and dynamic migration policy
Migration can delay island local convergence and intrinsically preserve diversity
Ironically migration is also potential to bring overall island global convergence faster
In a certain generation the migrated individuals among islands will have similar value genetic drift
So this work aims to preserve global diversity better by implementing Localized IMGA LIMGA and Dual Dynamic Migration Policy DDMP
LIMGA creates unique evolution trends by using a different kind of GAs for each island
DDMP is a new migration policy which rules the individual migration
DDMP determines the state of an island according to its diversity and attractivity level
By determining its states DDMP ensures the individual migrating to the correct island dynamically
We call the combination of LIMGA and DDMP as Dual Migration LIMGA DM-LIMGA
Our experiments show that DM-LIMGA can preserve the diversity better
As its implication DM-LIMGA can create a more extensive search space and dominates the results among other solvers .
