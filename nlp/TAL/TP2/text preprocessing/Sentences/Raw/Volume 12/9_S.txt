A survey on particle swarm optimization with emphasis on engineering and network applications
Swarm intelligence is a kind of artificial intelligence that is based on the collective behavior of the decentralized and self-organized systems
This work focuses on reviewing a heuristic global optimization method called particle swarm optimization PSO
This includes the mathematical representation of PSO in contentious and binary spaces the evolution and modifications of PSO over the last two decades
We also present a comprehensive taxonomy of heuristic-based optimization algorithms such as genetic algorithms tabu search simulated annealing cross entropy and illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of these algorithms
Furthermore we present the application of PSO on graphics processing unit and show various applications of PSO in networks .
