Frequency analysis for dendritic cell population tuning
The dendritic cell algorithm DCA has been applied successfully to a diverse range of applications
These applications are related by the inherent uncertainty associated with sensing the application environment
The DCA has performed well using unfiltered signals from each environment as inputs
In this paper we demonstrate that the DCA has an emergent filtering mechanism caused by the manner in which the cell accumulates its internal variables
Furthermore we demonstrate a relationship between the migration threshold of the cells and the transfer function of the algorithm
A tuning methodology is proposed and a robotic application published previously is revisited using the new tuning technique .
