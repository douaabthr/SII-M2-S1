Genetic-based approach for cue phrase selection in dialogue act recognition
Automatic cue phrase selection is a crucial step for designing a dialogue act recognition model using machine learning techniques
The approaches currently used are based on specific type of feature selection approaches called ranking approaches
Despite their computational efficiency for high dimensional domains they are not optimal with respect to relevance and redundancy
In this paper we propose a genetic-based approach for cue phrase selection which is essentially a variable length genetic algorithm developed to cope with the high dimensionality of the domain
We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach against several ranking approaches
Additionally we assess its performance for the selection of cue phrases enriched by phrase s type and phrase s position
The results provide experimental evidences on the ability of the genetic-based approach to handle the drawbacks of the ranking approaches and to exploit cue s type and cue s position information to improve the selection
Furthermore we validate the use of the genetic-based approach for machine learning applications
We use selected sets of cue phrases for building a dynamic Bayesian networks model for dialogue act recognition
The results show its usefulness for machine learning applications .
