Exploratory data analysis with artificial immune systems
We use a modified version of the CLONALG algorithm to perform exploratory data analysis
Since we wish to compare results from a number of methods we only report on linear projections which have unique solutions
We incorporate a type of Gram Schmidt orthogonalisation 15 into the affinity maturation process to capture multiple components
We combine the new algorithm with reinforcement learning 17,20 and with cross entropy maximization 13,19
Finally we combine several different non-standard adaptation methods using bagging and show that we get reliable convergence to accurate filters .
