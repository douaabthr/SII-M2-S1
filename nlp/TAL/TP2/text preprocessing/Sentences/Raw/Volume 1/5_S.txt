Neuroevolution from architectures to learning
Artificial neural networks ANNs are applied to many real-world problems ranging from pattern classification to robot control
In order to design a neural network for a particular task the choice of an architecture including the choice of a neuron model and the choice of a learning algorithm have to be addressed
Evolutionary search methods can provide an automatic solution to these problems
New insights in both neuroscience and evolutionary biology have led to the development of increasingly powerful neuroevolution techniques over the last decade
This paper gives an overview of the most prominent methods for evolving ANNs with a special focus on recent advances in the synthesis of learning architectures .
