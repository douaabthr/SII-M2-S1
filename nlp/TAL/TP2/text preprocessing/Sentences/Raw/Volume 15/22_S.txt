Vine copula-based EDA for dynamic multiobjective optimization
Dynamic Multiobjective Problems cover a set of real-world problems that have many conflicting objectives
These problems are challenging and well known by the dynamic nature of their objective functions constraint functions and problem parameters which often change over time
In fact dealing with these problems has not been investigated in detail using the Estimation of Distribution Algorithms EDAs
Thus we propose in this paper an EDA-based on Vine Copulas algorithm to deal with Dynamic Multiobjective Problems DMOPs
Vines Copulas are graphical models that represent multivariate dependence using bivariate copulas
The proposed Copula-based Estimation of Distribution Algorithm labeled Dynamic Vine-Copula Estimation of Distribution Algorithm DynVC-EDA is used to implement two search strategies
The first strategy is an algorithm that uses the model as a memory to save the status of the best solutions obtained during the current generation
The second strategy is a prediction-based algorithm that uses the history of the best solutions to predict a new population when a change occurs
The proposed algorithms are tested using a set of benchmarks provided with CEC2015 and the Gee-Tan-Abbass
Statistical findings show that the DynVC-EDA is competitive to the state-of-the-art methods in dealing with dynamic multiobjective optimization .
