A fair and efficient resource sharing scheme using modified grey wolf optimizer
With the rapid upsurge in large-scale computing resource sharing in heterogeneous distributed systems where users goals are conflicting has become a paramount research issue
The resource sharing or resource allocation problem is attributed to allocating users tasks across multiple computing resources so that the utility of the resources is improved while ensuring the quality of services
In this paper the resource allocation problem is considered as a bi-objective optimization problem including minimizing response time and the utilization imbalance between resources
To optimize both the objectives simultaneously the contributions of this paper are manifolds
First the problem is modeled as an optimization problem by considering both the objectives in an integrated manner
Second the resource allocation problem is formulated as a non-cooperative game
Finally to derive the game s solution in a distributed manner aBestResponse dynamics basedModifiedGreyWolfOptimizerBR-MGWOis proposed
Further to assess the efficacy ofBR-MGWO it is compared with two other approaches i.e. GOSandNCOPon problem instances of various settings
The experimental results show thatBR-MGWOnot only provides less response time while provides better improvements in utilization imbalance which is reduced by 50% and 71% respectively in comparison to theGOSandNCOP .
