Minimum landmarks for robot localization in orthogonal environments
Robot localization is one of the most fundamental problems in motion planing with many important applications in tracking vehicles and router systems
One way for localizing the robot is trilateration which is used in the environments without GPS antenna by using a number of signals that can be measure their distance to robot at any time
It has already been shown that lfloor frac 8n 9 rfloor landmarks are sufficient for trilaterating a simple n-side
Later as a better result it has been proved that lfloor frac 2n 3 rfloor landmarks are sufficient for this purpose
In this paper we discuss the problem for orthogonal polygons and show that frac n 2 landmarks suffice for trilaterating an orthogonaln-gon
This theoretical achievement is important for most evolutionary algorithms and neuro-computing techniques which need more speedup and high efficiency .
