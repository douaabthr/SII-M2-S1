A three-stage PSO-based methodology for tuning an optimal PD-controller for robotic arm manipulators
Six degrees-of-freedom DoF robot manipulators are dynamically coupled and highly nonlinear multi-variable systems
Calculating the optimal joint angles from the operational space i. e
inverse kinematics and designing the optimal joint controller parameters are two important research topics
This paper proposes a 3 stage Particle Swarm Optimization PSO based methodology for solving the inverse kinematics and optimizing the controller parameters
In the first stage a PSO algorithm solves the inverse kinematics problem by minimizing a multi-objective cost function in the operational space i. e
the error in the end-effector s pose and therefore finds the optimal joint angles
In the second stage polynomial functions generate the desired trajectory between the initial and final poses in the joint space
Finally a second PSO algorithm tunes six proportional-derivative PD controllers one for each joint to track the desired trajectory by minimizing another multi-objective cost function in the joint space
Two case studies based on six DoF Puma 560 validate the performance of the proposed methodology
Simulation results show that the proposed 3 stage methodology provides fast and accurate results as the PSO algorithms are effective in solving the inverse kinematics problem and tuning the optimal PD parameters .
