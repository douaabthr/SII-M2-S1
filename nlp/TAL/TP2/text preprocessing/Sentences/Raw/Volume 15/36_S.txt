Particle swarm optimization for solving a scan-matching problem based on the normal distributions transform
In this paper an evolutionary scan-matching approach is proposed to solve an optimization issue in simultaneous localization and mapping SLAM
A rich literature has been invested in this direction however most of the proposed approaches lack fast convergence and simplicity regarding the optimization process which should directly affect the accuracy of the environment s map and the estimated pose
It is a line of research that is always active offering various solutions to this issue
Among many SLAM methods the normal distributions transform approach NDT has shown high performances where numerous works have been published up to date and many studies demonstrate its efficiencywrtother methods
Nevertheless few works have been interested to solve the optimization issue
The proposed solution is based on NDT scan-matching using particle swarm optimization PSO and it is dubbed NDT-PSO
The main contribution is to solve the pose estimation problem based on PSO and iterative NDT maps
The performances of the NDT-PSO approach have been proven in real experiments performed on a car-like mobile robot in both static and dynamic environments
NDT-PSO is tested for different swarm sizes and the results show that 70 particles are more than enough to find the best particle while avoiding local minima even in loop closing
The algorithm is also suitable for real time applications with an average runnnig time of 145 rm ms for 70 particles and 70 iterations of the optimization process
This value can be further reduced using fewer particles and iterations
The accuracy of the proposed approach is also evaluatedwrtother SLAM methods widely used among the robot operating system community and it has been shown that NDT-PSO outperforms these algorithms .
