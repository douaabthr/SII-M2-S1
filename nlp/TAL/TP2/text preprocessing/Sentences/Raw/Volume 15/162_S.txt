Research on automatic cleaning algorithm of multi-dimensional network redundant data based on big data
In order to realize the research on network redundant data cleaning based on big data this paper designs a set of redundant data cleaning framework according to the data processing flow before data analysis
According to the spatial correlation of redundant data a method of data cleaning is designed
In the data cleaning method appropriate cleaning algorithms are designed for abnormal data and missing data respectively in which mathematical probability design is applied to abnormal data to delete the data with obvious deviation from the normal data value
The spatial model and algorithm are designed by applying spatial correlation to the missing data to fill the missing data value after the redundant data is cleaned by other steps in the method
The accuracy of the model is compared with that of the common data prediction algorithm and the accuracy between the algorithm and the redundant data set is verified .
