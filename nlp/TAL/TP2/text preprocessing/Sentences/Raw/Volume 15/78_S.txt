Fuzzy integrated salp swarm algorithm-based RideNN for prostate cancer detection using histopathology images
One of the dreadful diseases in the medical industry is prostate cancer and it is growing at a higher rate among men
Hence it is a necessity to detect cancer in an early stage due to the alarming increase in the reports
Various techniques are introduced for effective prostate cancer detection using histopathology images
Accordingly an automatic method is proposed for segmenting and classifying prostate cancer
This paper presents the prostate cancer detection method using histopathology images by proposing the fuzzy-based salp swarm algorithm-based rider neural network SSA-RideNN classifier
At first the input image is fed to the pre-processing step and then the segmentation is performed using Color Space transformation and thresholding
Once the segmentation is performed the feature extraction is done by extracting multiple kernel scale invariant feature transform features along with the texture features that are extracted based on local optimal oriented pattern descriptor to improve the classification accuracy
Finally the prostate cancer detection is done based on the proposed fuzzy-based SSA-RideNN which is developed by integrating fuzzy approach with SSA-RideNN
The performance of the proposed fuzzy-based SSA-RideNN is analyzed using sensitivity specificity and accuracy
The proposed fuzzy-based SSA-RideNN produces the maximum accuracy of 0.9190 a maximum sensitivity of 0.9084 and maximum specificity of 0.9 indicating its superiority .
