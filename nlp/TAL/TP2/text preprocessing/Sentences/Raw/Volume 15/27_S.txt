A cloud model based symbiotic organism search algorithm for DG allocation in radial distribution network
Recently metaheuristic algorithms have become popular in solving DG placement problems due to its advantages of simple implementation and ability to find the near optimal solution for complex and large-scale optimization problems
Symbiotic organism search SOS is one of the latest metaheuristic algorithms introduced to solve DG placement problems
Unlike many other metaheuristic algorithms SOS is simple to implement and does not use any control parameters which lead to enhancing performance stability
However like other optimization algorithms SOS suffers with local optimal and stagnations which affects its accuracy and convergence especially in solving real world problems like DG placement problem
This work attempts to enhance performance of SOS by combining with cloud-based model
The proposed algorithm is named cloud based model symbiotic organism search CMSOS
In CMSOS Cloud-based theories have been used to generate random number operator in mutualism phase of the original SOS
To assess the performance of CMSOS in solving optimization problems 26 benchmark functions with different dimensions have been used
The performance of the proposed algorithm has been tested for real world DG placement problems
The performed analysis such as statistical convergence and complexity measures show superiority of the proposed algorithm compare to the studied algorithms .
