Frequency offset estimation based on a combination of FFT and CZT for DP-QDB coherent receiver
A new frequency-offset-estimation FOE method for dual-polarized quadrature duobinary modulation DP-QDB which is based on a combination of fast Fourier transform FFT and chirp z transform CZT is proposed
This method is investigated at 128 Gb/s in five-channel wavelength-division-multiplexing DP-QDB systems by simulations
The simulation results show that the proposed method can greatly promote FOE accuracy
When the proposed method with FFT and CZT points of 1024 is compared with the traditional unimproved method with FFT points of 2048 the former is 70% lower than the latter in FOE error in the case of basically the same computational complexity
Besides two FOE implementation schemes for DP-QDB are compared
It is found that the implementation scheme in which the FOE module is put after the post filter has better estimation performance .
