Algorithm for speech emotion recognition classification based on Mel-frequency Cepstral coefficients and broad learning system
Speech plays a major role in emotional transmitting information in humans and speech emotion recognition has become an important part of the human computer system especially in specific systems with high requirements for real-time and accuracy
To improve the accuracy and real-time of speech emotion recognition people have done a lot of work in speech emotion feature extraction and speech emotion recognition algorithms but the recognition rate also needs improvement
In this paper we propose a speech emotion recognition method based on Mel-frequency Cepstral coefficients MFCC and broad learning network
39 dimensional MFCC features were extracted after preprocess of the speech signal
After labelling and standardizing the data a data prediction model is built
Finally the data set is split into training and test data onto a certain ratio 0.8
We experimented with broad learning network architecture
And then the data processing in the broad learning network is improved
The proposed algorithm is a neural network structure that does not rely on deep structure which has a small amount of calculation excellent calculation speed and simple structure
The experimental results show that the proposed network architecture achieves higher accuracy and it turned out to be the most accurate in recognizing emotions in CASIA Chinese emotion corpus
The recognition rate can reach 100%
Therefore the proposed network architecture provides an effective method of speech emotion recognition .
