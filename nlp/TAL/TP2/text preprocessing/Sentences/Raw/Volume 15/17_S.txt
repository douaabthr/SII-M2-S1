Wrapper scan chain design algorithm for testing of embedded cores based on chaotic dragonfly algorithm
As embedded pre-designed and pre-validated cores in system-on-chip SoC designs have increased usage the wrapper scan chain design WSCD for the embedded cores is one of the fundamental ways to reduce the SoC test time
In this paper a chaotic dragonfly algorithm CDA for WSCD is proposed to minimize the test time of embedded cores by balancing the packaged scan chains WSCs . Since the WSCD problem is non-continuous we improve the dragonfly algorithm DA with integer coding to make it suitable for the WSCD problem
In order to improve population diversity and prevent falling into local optimum state we introduce chaotic strategy into DA
Furthermore a repaired operator that considers the specific knowledge is added to the DA
Since the CDA is a swarm intelligence method it is expected to effectively solve the NP-hard problem
The experimental results on ITC 02 SoC benchmark show that the proposed algorithm can improve the balanced results and shorten the test time compared with the existing algorithms .
