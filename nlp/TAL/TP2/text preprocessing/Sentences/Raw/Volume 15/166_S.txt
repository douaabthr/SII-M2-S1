A new differential evolution algorithm for cooperative fuzzy rule mining application to anomaly detection
Fuzzy classification rule mining can be considered as a challenging optimization problem with the purpose of extracting accurate and interpretable rules
This paper deals with a Michigan cooperative approach for mining fuzzy rules
The proposed algorithm named EDE-FRMiner uses an enhanced differential evolution that evolves population of individuals each one represents a single rule
The whole population collaborates to generate in one shot an accurate and reduced number of rules
EDE-FRMiner is an intelligent process of evolution that uses fast arithmetic operators and a new cooperative weights memory
This latter allows sharing information between individuals
In addition it uses a new threshold based fitness function using a redefined support and confidence measures
The adaptive threshold mechanism used in the fitness function aims to adapt the miner system to problems with dynamic training data
Experiments are carried out using the NSL-kdd 99 intrusion detection data set and other data sets from the UCI repository
A comparative study with other competitive evolutionary rule based systems is performed and the results show the effectiveness of proposed algorithm .
