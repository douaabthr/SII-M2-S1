T-TOHIP Trust-based topology-hiding multipath routing in mobile ad hoc network
In recent years security in mobile ad hoc network MANET is the active research topic in both industry and academia because of the rising availability of tiny adapted mobile devices and the multipath routing protocols have been received much attention in MANET
Accordingly this paper introduces the trust-based topology-hiding multipath routing algorithm for the MANET
The proposed model finds the security factor of each node in the MANET and the neighbor nodes are selected based on the defined security factor
The proposed routing method has four models for defining the security factor namely the trusted model energy model delay model and the mobility model
The proposed multipath routing determines the secured route between the sender and receiver based on the selected neighbor nodes
Finally data communication is performed through the selected multipath
The performance of the proposed multipath routing is analyzed with the existing methods such as topology-hiding multipath routing protocol Fractional lion optimization to topology-hiding multi-path routing and Adaptive Fractional lion optimization to topology-hiding multi-path routing for the performance metrics such as throughput delay energy and packet drop rate PDR
Simulation results show that the proposed multipath routing has the better values of 0.330566 0.376754 0.319369 and 0.380559 after 50 s of simulation for throughput delay energy and PDR than the existing models when there is an attack on the node .
