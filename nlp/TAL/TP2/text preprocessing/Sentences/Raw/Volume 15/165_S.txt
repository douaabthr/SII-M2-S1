Seeking a balance between population diversity and premature convergence for real-coded genetic algorithms with crossover operator
The major issue for optimization with genetic algorithms GAs is getting stuck on a local optimum or a low computation efficiency
In this research we propose a new real-coded based crossover operator by using the Exponentiated Pareto distribution EPX which aims to preserve the two extremes
We used EPX with three the most reputed mutation operators Makinen Periaux and Toivanen mutation MPTM non uniform mutation NUM and power mutation PM
The experimental results with eighteen well-known models depict that our proposed EPX operator performs better than the other competitive crossover operators
The comparison analysis is evaluated through mean standard deviation and the performance index
Significance of EPX vs competitive is examined by performing the two-tailed t-test
Hence the new crossover scheme appears to be significant as well as comparable to establish the crossing among parents for better offspring .
