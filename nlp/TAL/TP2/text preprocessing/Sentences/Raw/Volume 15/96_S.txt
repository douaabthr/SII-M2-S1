Tool combination model based on task sequence using an optimized orientation genetic algorithm
As an application field of service science cloud manufacturing CM has been widely studied in vertical and horizontal services
At present CM s vertical service research is limited to the technical research of specific processing and manufacturing and gives less consideration to the background of horizontal integration services
The research on horizontal service judges the effect of the combination only according to quality of service QoS attributes
In the actual processing process the combination s effect depends not only on QoS but also on the geographical aspects company and other attributes
Based on this we propose a tool combination model based on the task sequence TCMbTS
The TCMbTS establishes the association ontology model of tool resources and tasks and proposes a mapping method to provide vertical service for CM
Then proposed optimized orientation genetic algorithm OPOGA to solve the combination optimization and recommendation problem of TCMbTS and provide horizontal services for CM
Finally an experiment is performed to verify OPOGA with validity and efficiency .
