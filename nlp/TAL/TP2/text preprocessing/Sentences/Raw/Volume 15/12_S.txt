A novel disruption based symbiotic organisms search to solve economic dispatch
Economic dispatch ED is one of the vital prospects in the energy management system for determining the optimal power generation distribution among several committed power generating units
The objective of ED is to generate the electric power to meet the load demand by minimizing the total operating cost subjected to various equality and inequality constraints
This ED problem is generally solved using conventional techniques such as a gradient method by assuming the objective function as linear and convex
However in general the ED problem is constrained non-convex large scale multimodal and highly nonlinear optimization problem
In order to overcome this drawback various heuristic techniques have been introduced in the literature
Symbiotic organism search SOS is one of the emerging nature-inspired meta-heuristic algorithms
Due to simple in implementation and free from algorithm-specific control parameters the SOS algorithm has gained a reputation among the researchers
The SOS technique mimics the biological interaction between two distinct species to survive and proliferate in the ecosystem
To evade the suboptimal solution and to enhance the exploration and exploitation of the SOS algorithm the disruption operator is integrated with the basic SOS to form a novel disruption based SOS DSOS algorithm
The disruption strategy is originated from astrophysics and has the ability to shift between exploration and exploitation during the process of finding an optimum solution
To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method it is applied on various test systems such as 3 unit 5 unit 6 unit 13 unit 20 unit 38 unit and 110 unit systems to solve different ED problems namely without transmission losses TL with transmission losses by simultaneously considering valve point loading VPL effect along with TL by simultaneously considering the effect of ramp rate limits RRLs prohibited operating zones POZs and TLs and dynamic economic load dispatch by considering RRLs POZs VPL and TL
The comparison of DSOS based simulation results with other methods reveal the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method to provide minimum total generation cost in all the cases with better convergence rate and less computational time .
