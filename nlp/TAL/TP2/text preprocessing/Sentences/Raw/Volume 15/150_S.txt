Variable selection for generalized partially linear models with longitudinal data
Variables selection and parameter estimation are of great significance in all regression analysis
A variety of approaches have been proposed to tackle this problem
Among those the penalty-based shrinkage approach has been most popular for the ability to carry out the variable selection and parameter estimation simultaneously
However not much work is available on the variable selection for the generalized partially models GPLMs with longitudinal data
In this paper we proposed a variable selection procedure for GPLMs with longitudinal data
The inference is based on the SCAD-penalized quadratic inference functions which is obtained after the B-spline approximating to non-parametric function in the model
The proposed approach efficiently utilized the within-cluster correlation information which can improve estimating efficiency
The proposed approach also has the virtue of low computational cost
With the tuning parameter chosen by BIC the correct model is identified with probability tends to 1
The resulted estimator of the parametric component is asymptotic to a normal distribution and that of the non-parametric function achieves the optimal convergence rate
The performance of the proposed methods is evaluated through extensive simulation studies
A real data analysis shows that the proposed approach succeeds in excluding the insignificant variable .
