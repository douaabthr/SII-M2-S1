SOMDROID android malware detection by artificial neural network trained using unsupervised learning
Android has gained its popularity due to its open-source and number of freely available apps in its official play store
Appropriate functioning of Android apps depends upon the permission or set of permissions which an app demands at the time of installation and run-time
By taking the advantage of these permissions or set of permissions cybercriminals are developing malware-infected apps daily
In this study we proposed a framework named as SOMDROID that work on the principle of unsupervised machine learning algorithm
To develop an effective and efficient Android malware detection model we collect 5,00 000 distinct Android apps from promised repositories and extract 1844 unique features
Further to select significant features or feature sets we applied six different feature ranking approaches in this study
With the selected feature or feature sets we implement the Self-Organizing Map SOM algorithm of Kohonen and measure four distinct performance parameters i.e. Intra-cluster distance Inter-cluster distance Accuracy and F-measure
Empirical result reveals that our proposed framework is able to detect 98.7% malware that belongs to unknown families and in addition to that the detection rate is higher by 2% when compared to commercial anti-virus scanners and frameworks proposed in the literature .
