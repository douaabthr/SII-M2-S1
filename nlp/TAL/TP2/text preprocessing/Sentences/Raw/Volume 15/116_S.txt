MRMR-SSA a hybrid approach for optimal feature selection
A critical issue in data mining and machine learning is feature selection
The crucial part is how to specify the eminent problem-relevant features out of a collection of features contained in a dataset
Feature selection process goes with the pre processing steps in knowledge revelation KDD process
It aids in eliminating the unnecessary redundant and unrelated irrelevant features in order to improve the fulfillment of classifying algorithms
It chooses the most optimal count of features that is best suited to classification model which in turn advance the learning process
As such the correctness accuracy of classification increases
Thus in this paper we have proposed a two-staged hybrid arrangement of model that contains filter-based approach in the first stage to filter out the unnecessary and unrelated features and then providing these acquired features as input to the next stage that is the wrapper method by availing the recent swarm based algorithm namely salp swarm algorithm or SSA
The proposed model is named as MRMR-SSA
The binary version of SSA is utilized to evaluate the features that can either take the feature as 1 or discard it as 0
Specific classifiers like XGBoost AdaBoost Randomforests and LogisticRegressionare made in use in this paper
Accuracy is considered to measure the performance of each classifier
An analogy is made for the proposed hybrid feature selection approach with a few familiar algorithms specifically MRMR-PSO MRMR-GA MRMR-ALO and MRMR-ACO
The proposed hybrid approach leaves behind other given hybrid methods .
