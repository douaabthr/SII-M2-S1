Support vector regression and extended nearest neighbor for video object retrieval
Video retrieval is one of the emerging areas in video capturing that gained various technical advances increasing the availability of a huge mass of videos
For the text or the image query given retrieving the relevant videos and the objects from the videos is not always an easy task
A hybrid model was developed in the previous work using the Nearest Search Algorithm NSA and exponential weighted moving average EWMA for the video object retrieval
In NSA EWMA the object trajectories are retrieved based on the query specific distance
This work extends the previous work by developing a novel path equalization scheme for equalizing the path length of the query and the tracked object
Initially a hybrid model based on Support Vector Regression and NSA tracks the position of the object in the video
The proposed density measure scheme equalizes the path length of the query and the object
Then the identified path length related to the query is given to extended nearest neighbor classifier for retrieving the video
From the simulation results it is evident that the proposed video retrieval scheme achieved high values of 0.901 0.860 0.849 and 0.922 for precision recall F-measure and multiple object tracking precision respectively .
