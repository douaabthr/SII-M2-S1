Hyperspectral image classification using support vector machine a spectral spatial feature based approach
Recently spectral spatial information based algorithms are gaining more attention because of its robustness accuracy and efficiency
In this paper an SVM based classification method has been proposed which extracts features considering both spectral and spatial information
The proposed method exploits SVM to encode spectral spatial information of pixel and also used for classification task
A clean comparison of relative gain achieved with inclusion of spatial features with its spectral counterpart is also investigated
The experiment has been performed using three benchmark datasets Indian Pines Pavia University and Salinas
Experiments show that the proposed method outperforms the classification algorithms K nearest neighbors linear discriminant analysis Naive Bayes and decision tree .
