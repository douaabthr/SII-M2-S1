A novel edge boosting approach for image super-resolution
Image super-resolution is highly demanding area in both research as well as industry
In this paper a novel deep network to acquire the high-resolution image from the input low-resolution image has been proposed
The proposed a novel residual-edge module is used to build the network for Single Image Super Resolution
The residual-edge module comprises of traditional residual learning followed by the proposed edge boosting mechanism
The proposed edge boosting mechanism propagates difference between the residual feature maps across the network with dense connections
The proposed edge boosting mechanism enhances the edge content in the feature maps learned by the residual blocks
This study uses conditional generative adversarial networks framework to optimize the weight parameters
Experiments have been carried out on benchmark database to validate the proposed network for image super-resolution
Empirical results show that the proposed network performs better other existing methods for image super-resolution .
