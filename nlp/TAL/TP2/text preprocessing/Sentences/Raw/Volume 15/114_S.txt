Optimal feature selection and hybrid deep learning for direct marketing campaigns in banking applications
As stated by a mass marketing technique the objective of market-based companies is to maximize the product of targeted direct marketing campaigns other than reaching prospects and customers differently
The maximum return of the direct marketing campaigns is based on an appropriate prediction of the response rate and an elaborated description of the prospects
This paper plans to develop a new direct marketing campaign model in banking applications using a hybrid deep learning architecture
The proposed model consists of several steps like a Data acquisition b Optimal feature selection and c prediction
Initially the direct marketing campaign data corresponding to banking applications are collected from other Google sites like Portuguese banking institutions
With the collected information optimal feature selection is performed in order to reduce the dimension of the attribute or feature vector thus can reduce the complexity of the prediction algorithm
Here the optimal feature selection is performed by a new variant of a meta-heuristic algorithm termed as Self Adaptive-Sea Lion Optimization SA-SLnO Algorithm
Further the optimally collected features are subjected to deep hybrid learning with the integration of Deep Belief Network DBN and Recurrent Neural Network RNN
As an improvement to the deep learning model the hidden neurons of both DBN and RNN are optimized by the same SA-SLnO
The outcome of the hybrid classifier is the decision of the customer on banking deposits
Finally the performance of the proposed model is certified by comparing over the conventional methods through the evaluation of relevant performance measures .
