Optimal floor planning in VLSI using improved adaptive particle swarm optimization
Floor planning is necessary to design the VLSI circuit
The complete computational characteristics of the manufactured chip are evaluated by floor planning process
It is the multi-objective problem in which different objectives are fulfilled at a time
Here a new Interactive Self-Improvement based Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization ISI-APSO technique is proposed to enhance the exploration efficiency and accuracy than convolutional PSO
Within less computation time the proposed ISI-APSO technique attains best global search throughout the space
The simulation results show that the proposed ISI-APSO algorithm achieves better performance than other heuristic algorithms in exploring efficiency and speed of convergence
In order to place the whole modules and their internally connected wire lengths the Multi-objective optimization method is utilized
Therefore the necessary layout area is minimized
Moreover the implemented results demonstrate the importance of the proposed algorithm with respect to the robust performance .
