Classify four imagined objects with EEG signals
EEG signals contain information directly related to cognitive activity
This paper presents a method to classify the images a person imagines via the information provided by the EEG signals
The images relating to the objects tree house plane and dog have been reconstructed
We have used a convolutional neural networks to obtain the reconstruction of the images and a genetic algorithm to find the parameters of this network
The results obtained have been evaluated by means of a Chebychev metric to compare the images and it shows that the reconstruction is performed with a success of 57% over chance with an accuracy in the classification of 60% and a kappa value of 0.40 demonstrating that the classification of five mental states where four of them come from the visual imagery is possible .
