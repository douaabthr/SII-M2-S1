A quantum class topper optimization algorithm to solve combined emission economic dispatch problem
A combined emission and economic dispatch problem is referred as a complex multi-objective problem related to power system
In this article an hybridized version of class topper optimization known as quantum class topper optimization is proposed to solve this problem
In quantum class topper optimization quantum mechanism is used to enhance the searching ability of the proposed algorithm
The exploration exploitation and convergence behavior of quantum class topper optimization is validated using benchmark functions
Later four test cases on combined emission and economic dispatch are used to test the effectiveness of quantum class topper optimization
These four tests prove that the proposed optimization algorithm is effective to solve this real time optimization problem .
