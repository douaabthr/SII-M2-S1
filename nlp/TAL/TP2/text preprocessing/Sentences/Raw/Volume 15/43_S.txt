A hybrid optimization model for resource allocation in OFDM-based cognitive radio system
Cognitive radio CR system has been considered as the key technology for the mobile computing and wireless communication in future
However the main challenge of the CR system is the allocation of resources with minimized transmission power at an enhanced rate of transmission
This paper proposes the hybrid method which is the combination of Grey Wolf Optimization GWO and Group Search Optimization GSO to allocate the resources in the CR system in an optimal manner
It simulates the GWOGS-based CR system relying on the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing OFDM to allocate the recourses optimally
After attaining the respective simulation it compares the performance of the GWOGS to the conventional algorithms like Genetic Algorithm GA Particle Swarm Optimization PSO Artificial Bee Colony ABC Firefly FF GSO GWO and SOAP
Moreover it provides the valuable comparative analysis in terms of convergence ranking cost and impact of orthogonality
In addition it reveals the statistical analysis of the entire benchmark algorithm to attain the optimum result
Thus the experimental result affirms the challenging performance of the proposed method against the conventional algorithms .
