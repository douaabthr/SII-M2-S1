A novel method to solve visual tracking problem hybrid algorithm of grasshopper optimization algorithm and differential evolution
To provide effective resolutions for complex real-life problems and other optimization problems abundant various procedures have been presented in the last few decades
This paper proposes a simple but efficient hybrid evolutionary algorithm called GOA-DE for solving visual tracking problems
In the proposed hybrid algorithm Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm GOA operates in refining the vector
In contrast the Differential Evolution DE algorithm is used for transforming the decision vectors based on genetic operators
The improvement in maintaining the balance between exploration and exploitation abilities is made by incorporating genetic operators namely mutation and crossover in GOA
The success of GOA-DE is estimated by 23 classical benchmark functions CEC05 functions and CEC 2014 functions
The GOA-DE algorithm results prove that it is very viable associated with the metaheuristic up-to-date procedures
Similarly visual tracking problems are resolved by the GOA-DE algorithm as a real challenging case study
Visual tracking several objects robustly in a video stream with complex backgrounds and objects are beneficial in subsequent generation computer vision structures
But in exercise it is problematic to plan an effective video-based visual tracking scheme owing to the fast-moving objects probable occlusions and diverse light circumstances
Investigational outcomes indicate that the GOA-DE-based tracker can energetically track a random target in many thought-provoking cases .
