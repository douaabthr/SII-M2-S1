Prediction of rock mass rating using neural network with an improved rider optimization algorithm
Evaluation of TBM performance is critical for the choice of TBM specifications and tunnel design
In the past decades the hypothetical schemes depending on the rock fragmentation process and the experimental models up to field surveillance as well as machine performance are the two main methods
Traditional and conventional approaches for rock mass rate RMR prediction usually consider excessive parameters and the accuracies are far from actual values
A new RMR prediction model based on the optimized neural network NN is designed
To improve the prediction accuracy this paper proposed a new self-adaptive rider optimization algorithm SA-ROA which applied optimization logic to train the NN by updating the weight as wave velocity Vp transverse wave velocity Vs Vp/Vs statistics Stat orientation magnitude polarity wave type and metre
Finally the RMR prediction analysis of the adopted NN-SA-ROA model is compared to the conventional and traditional classifiers with varied learning percentages 50% 60% 70% and 80% for three data sets respectively
Subsequently the performance of the proposed work is verified using other approaches based on error analysis
The predicted mean absolute errors MAEs and the mean absolute percentage errors MAPEs of SA-ROA are smaller than conventional and traditional schemes
The results show that the proposed method can successfully predict the actual RMR .
