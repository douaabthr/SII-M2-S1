Convolutional neural networks in medical image understanding a survey
Imaging techniques are used to capture anomalies of the human body
The captured images must be understood for diagnosis prognosis and treatment planning of the anomalies
Medical image understanding is generally performed by skilled medical professionals
However the scarce availability of human experts and the fatigue and rough estimate procedures involved with them limit the effectiveness of image understanding performed by skilled medical professionals
Convolutional neural networks CNNs are effective tools for image understanding
They have outperformed human experts in many image understanding tasks
This article aims to provide a comprehensive survey of applications of CNNs in medical image understanding
The underlying objective is to motivate medical image understanding researchers to extensively apply CNNs in their research and diagnosis
A brief introduction to CNNs has been presented
A discussion on CNN and its various award-winning frameworks have been presented
The major medical image understanding tasks namely image classification segmentation localization and detection have been introduced
Applications of CNN in medical image understanding of the ailments of brain breast lung and other organs have been surveyed critically and comprehensively
A critical discussion on some of the challenges is also presented .
