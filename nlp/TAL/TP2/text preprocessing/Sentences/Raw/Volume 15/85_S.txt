Fusion model based on entropy by using optimized DCNN and iterative seed for multilane detection
The recent progress in the DSAs led to the progress of advanced lane detection systems for preventing accidents
The information about the lane is detected which is used for the vehicle control and provide warning to the drivers
This paper proposes the multi-lanes detection based on an entropy-based fusion approach
The main use of the proposed model for combining the results obtained by the EW-CSA based DCNN and iterative seed based on region for providing efficient multilane detection
Initially the lanes are detected using a deep learning technique that is trained using an optimization algorithm EW-CSA
Similarly the approach namely segmentation based on region is used for the detection of multi-lane
Depends on the results of the two approaches an fusion model based on entropy is proposed for making the best results based on a pre-defined threshold
The proposed method performance is evaluated based on the metrics such as specificity accuracy and sensitivity which outperforms with values 0.887 0.991 and 0.992 respectively .
