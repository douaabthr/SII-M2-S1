Fuzzy-based decisive approach for call admission control in the LTE networks
Long term evolution LTE is a user-friendly network in providing a user requested service and the growth of LTE is reported exponentially due to the attractive applications
The existence of the huge number of users and a massive presence of user demands in the network raise a question on the Quality-of-Service QoS
In order to assure the required QoS with the available resources in the network the paper proposes a call admission control scheme using a fuzzy-based decisive approach
The proposed method works based on the available resources in the network and allocates extra resource blocks when there is a lag in the demanded QoS
The flexible and user-friendly service is assured to three groups of users for which the users are categorized based on the requested service as soon the service is requested
The simulation environment is developed to perform the fuzzy-based call admission control in LTE such that the results prove that the proposed method outperformed the existing methods in terms of delay throughput cell power and call drops
The delay throughput cell power and call drops using the proposed method are 0.1103 s 1,294 932 bps 44.2071 dBm and 328 respectively
Also the proposed method has the minimum call blocking probability of 0.0527 and 0.2901 for handoff users and new users
It has the call dropping probability of 0.0528 and 0.3357 for handoff users and new users respectively .
