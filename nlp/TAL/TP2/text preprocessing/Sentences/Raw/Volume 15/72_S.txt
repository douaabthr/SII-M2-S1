Sea lion with enhanced exploration phase for optimization of polynomial fitness with SEM in lean technology
With the establishment of lean manufacturing myriad industries implemented the lean manufacturing principles and guidelines
To train the professionals based on certain policies to achieve continuous improvements in terms of productivity and minimizing wastages
However the complexities such as variability sustainability multi-dimensional views factory size to name just a few negatively influences the performance of deploying lean manufacturing in industries
It is therefore very important for companies to recognize and understand the critical success factors for successfully implementing lean manufacturing
Hence this paper plans to develop a model on concerning the analysis of lean manufacturing to find the most important factor regarding the technology among the industries
With this intention this paper is analyzed through three phases
In the first phase the prepared questionnaire is distributed to the professionals in various companies
In the questionnaire all the mandatory questions are included
Then the professional are recommended to fill the precise information as far as possible
In the second phase the responses from the concerned practitioners associated with the industries are considered for analysis
Herein the analysis is carried out based on structural equation modeling approaches with the contribution of higher order statistical analysis which is performed using the input factors such as the lean awareness lean technology organizational support organizational performance employee involvement and management commitment among the industries via attaining better maximum likelihood values of the questionnaires
In the third phase the Prediction of polynomial fitting of the response i. e
the objective function is achieved with the aid a novel optimization algorithm SLnO-EE model Sea Lion with Enhanced Exploration phase which is the extended version of SLnO Sea Lion Optimization
Finally the proposed SLnO-EE model is evaluated over traditional SLnO model in terms of certain performance evaluations to exhibit the improvement in prediction accuracy .
