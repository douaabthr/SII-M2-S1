Automatic handwritten character recognition of Devanagari language a hybrid training algorithm for neural network
In the field of image processing and Artificial Intelligence the character recognition and handwritten recognition have been emerging as one of the active and challenging research areas
In recent years there has been a notable development in the research associated with character recognition in handwritten Devanagari documents
To improve the recognition performance this paper tactics to develop new handwritten character recognition model using an improved machine learning approach
The proposed character recognition model includes four stages like pre-processing Segmentation Feature Extraction and Classification
Initially the scanned handwritten document for Devanagari language is subjected to pre-processing which includes stages like RGB to gray thresholding complement of image morphological operations linearization and noise removal using Median Filter
Then the characters of the pre-processed image are segmented using k-means clustering that is a popular method for cluster analysis
Further the features like Kirsch Directional Edge Freeman chain code and neighborhood distance weight using Delaunay Triangulation are extracted from the segmented characters
Subsequently the classification of characters is done using Neural Network NN where the new training algorithm is used in which the weights are optimized using a hybrid optimization by combining Lion Optimization Algorithm and Grey Wolf Optimization GWO
Here the update procedure of GWO is based on LA algorithm and hence the proposed algorithm is named as Lion Updated GWO LU-GWO
To the next of the implementation a valuable comparative analysis confirms the improved performance of the proposed LU-GWO-NN model over conventional methods in classifying the consonants numerals and vowels from different characters .
