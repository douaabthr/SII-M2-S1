Precision recall curve PRC classification trees
The classification of imbalanced data has presented a significant challenge for most well-known classification algorithms that were often designed for data with relatively balanced class distributions
Nevertheless skewed class distribution is a common feature in real world problems
It is especially prevalent in certain application domains with great need for machine learning and better predictive analysis such as disease diagnosis fraud detection bankruptcy prediction and suspect identification
In this paper we propose a novel tree-based algorithm based on the area under the precision recall curve for variable selection in the classification context
Our algorithm named as the Precision Recall curve classification tree or simply the PRC classification tree modifies two crucial stages in tree building
The first stage is to maximize the area under the precision recall curve in node variable selection
The second stage is to maximize the harmonic mean of recall and precision F-measure for threshold selection
We found the proposed PRC classification tree and its subsequent extension the PRC random forest work well especially for class-imbalanced data sets
We have demonstrated that our methods outperform their classic counterparts the usual CART and random forest for both synthetic and real data
Furthermore the ROC classification tree proposed by our group previously based on the area under the ROC curve has shown good performance in imbalanced data
Their combination the PRC ROC tree has also shows great promise in identifying the minority class .
