A novel authentication and authorization scheme in P2P networking using location-based privacy
In recent years peer-to-peer P2P network has reached popularity in file sharing as it is a distributed and decentralized network architecture
As there is no centralized authority there arise various attacks which lead to insecurity in the network
Thus the security issues of the P2P networks are to be considered with more care
This paper proposes an authentication and authorization approach named fuzzy enabled advanced encryption standard AES based multi-level authentication and authorization to offer security against various kinds of attacks that occur in the P2P networks
Here the authentication is carried out with the security factors namely location profile one-time password spatial information session password a hashing function and so on
Initially the user and the server are registered in the authentication process and then hashing functions and AES are used to perform multi-level authorization and authentication processes
Thus the proposed scheme improves the security of the P2P network
Using the proposed system the hit ratio obtained is 0.9 and the success rate is 0.7666 .
