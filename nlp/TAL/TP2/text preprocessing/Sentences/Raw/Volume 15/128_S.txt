A new approach for social navigation and interaction using a dynamic proxemia modeling
This paper treats the problem of social navigation and human robot interaction
In most previous works addressing this issue the proxemia concept has been considered static with regards to the activity s nature
Furthermore the F-Formation type is not considered
The different activities of people can not be considered similarly
For example the way to navigate socially without disturbing a group drinking coffee or discussing a poster is different just like the interaction location when serving coffee or explaining a poster
The main contribution of this paper is to propose a dynamic proxemia modeling approach DPMA for social navigation and interaction
It is based on proxemia and spatial modeling which allow the robot to navigate socially by considering the comfort of people and to interact in appropriate interaction conditions
It considers the F-Formation type and the nature of the activity additionally to the different social spaces and the navigation and interaction constraints
Then it uses a social map to encode them
The performance and the efficiency DPMA are evaluated both in three simulation environments using the ROS Stage simulator and on a real robot used as a service robot in a mediation event example
Promising results are given in this paper .
