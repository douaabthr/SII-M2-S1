Roadmap to distillery spent wash treatment and use of soft computing techniques
Distillery industries in several regions all over the world pose a serious risk as it generates unpleasant compounds
Under such circumstances it seeks an effective spent wash treatment to eliminate the contaminants
Accordingly this paper provides a relevant review regarding the distillery spent wash treatments associated with the proper treatments and coagulants
At first it reviews 67 recent research papers from which 24 papers belong to distillery spent wash treatment and remaining belongs to other treatments
Further it extends the valuable chronological review on distillery spent wash treatment
In addition it describes the several processes such as anaerobic treatment aerobic treatment nanofiltration reverse osmosis adsorption and electrochemical treatments adopted to treat distillery spent wash as reported in the literature
In the same way it analyses the usage of different types of coagulants such as natural electro and chemical coagulants used in distillery spent wash treatment
To the next of the coagulant analysis it checks out the performance review of entire contributions on distillery spent wash treatment
The conventional process for distillery spent wash treatment having limitations such as limited removal efficiency high operating cost and maintenance also it needs a high detention time that eventually increases the on the whole treatment process time
The aforesaid limitation can be overcome by adopting soft computing techniques
Soft computing has been widely studied and applied in the past three decades for engineering and scientific research computing
In environmental engineering engineers and researchers have effectively used various techniques of soft computing like fuzzy logic artificial neural networks adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems and support vector machines which can be useful for the researchers to achieve further research on distillery spent wash treatment .
