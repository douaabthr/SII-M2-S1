Research perceptions on ransomware attack a complete analysis on conventional authentication protocols in network
Nowadays Computer Networks and the internet is on the increase due to the precedence that provided by them
An enormous amount of information is accessed and allowed the users to share the information on an incredible scale while connecting the network to the Internet
Even though the internet nature crafts more benefits still it is posed by the limitations because of the attacks
One of the special types of malicious software attack is ransomware also called malware that affects the systems and restricts the user s access over the system
Further it files till the payment of ransom
This malware is made by locking the user s desktop and encrypting the user s files
This has emerged as a critical threat in network security since each day the raising of ransomware gets abundant
Hence the prediction of ransomware is considered as the major problem by the researchers and numerous researches are going on over this issue
This survey planned to review the network security models along with the authentication protocol
More importantly the ransomware attack is also highly concentrated in this survey
Further the literature analyses on diverse techniques under network security are made
Then the analysis also focused on the algorithms used and is categorized as protocols authentication algorithms optimization algorithms and other techniques
Moreover this survey demonstrates a detailed review of the cryptographic techniques attacks simulation tools and clouds that are exploited in the reviewed papers
Additionally the chronological review and the performance are reviewed under the network security models
Finally this paper exploits the research and described the challenges on the network security that can be used further in the future
