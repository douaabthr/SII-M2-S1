YOLOv2 acceleration using embedded GPU and FPGAs pros cons and a hybrid method
YOLOv2 is an object detection algorithm grounded on the Darknet neural network widely applied in the advanced driver assistance system
Nevertheless the YOLOv2 algorithm must be accelerated on a high-performance computing platform before being put into practical usage
Various computing platforms have their specific features
The merits or drawbacks of the accelerated platform are hard for the developers to recognize and pick up the right alternative based on real demands
This paper analyzes the pros and cons of embedded GPU and FPGA for improving the YOLOv2 algorithm concerning development speed power efficiency and computing performance
The analysis provides the developers with insights into choosing the hardware to optimize the YOLOv2 algorithm
According to the experimental data it is found that if FPGA is optimized profoundly the performance of power efficiency as well as speed will exceed embedded GPU
However the FPGA development procedure is tough and demands much more time for developers than the GPU development process
Finally we propose a balanced method to take advantage of GPU s development speed and FGPA s high performance .
