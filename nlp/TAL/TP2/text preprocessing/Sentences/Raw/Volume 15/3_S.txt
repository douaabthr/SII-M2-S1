A modified teaching learning metaheuristic algorithm with opposite-based learning for permutation flow-shop scheduling problem
Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization is one of the well-known metaheuristic algorithm in the research industry
Recently various population-based algorithms have been developed for solving optimization problems
In this paper a random scale factor approach is proposed to modify the simple TLBO algorithm
Modified Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization with Opposite-Based-Learning algorithm is applied to solve the Permutation Flow-Shop-Scheduling Problem with the purpose of minimizing the makespan
The OBL approach is used to enhance the quality of the initial population and convergence speed
PFSSP is used extensively for solving scheduling problem which belongs to the category of NP-hard optimization problems
First MTLBO is developed to effectively determine the PFSSP using the Largest Order Value rule-based random key so that individual job schedules are converted into discrete schedules
Second new initial populations are generated in MTLBO using the Nawaz Enscore Ham heuristic mechanism
Finally the local exploitation ability is enhanced in the MTLBO using effective swap insert and inverse structures
The performance of proposed algorithm is validated using ten benchmark functions and the Wilcoxon rank test
The computational results and comparisons indicate that the proposed algorithm outperformed over five well-known datasets such as Carlier Reeves Heller Taillards and VRF benchmark test functions compared to other metaheuristic algorithms
Thep-value indicated the significance and superiority of the proposed algorithm over other metaheuristic algorithms .
