Evolving goal-driven multi-agent communication what when and to whom
This paper presents an evolutionary approach that given a performance goal produces a communication strategy that can improve a multi-agent system s performance with respect to the desired goal
The evolved strategy determines what when and to whom agents communicate
The proposed approach further enables tuning the trade-off between the performance goal and communication cost to produce a strategy that achieves a good balance between the two objectives according the system s designer needs
Experiments are designed to evaluate the approach using the Wumpus World application domain with variations of three factors fitness parameters including objectives weights and action and communication costs fitness goal and simulation environment
Results show that the system s performance can be highly tuned by controlling communication and that the presented approach has significant utilization in improving the performance with respect to the goal .
