Towards a new Praxis in optinformatics targeting knowledge re-use in evolutionary computation simultaneous problem learning and optimization
As the field of evolutionary optimization continues to expand it is becoming increasingly common to incorporate various machine learning approaches such as clustering classification and regression models to improve algorithmic efficiency
However we note that although problem learning is popularly used in improving the ongoing optimization process little effort is ever made in extracting re-usable domain knowledge
In other words the acquired knowledge is seldom transferred and exploited for future design exercises
Focusing on evolutionary optimization in this paper we investigate the concept of simultaneous problem learning and optimization inspired by the following notions 1 that prior/dynamically acquired knowledge can enhance the effectiveness of evolutionary search and 2 that evolution can be geared towards gathering crucial knowledge about the underlying problem
Taking benchmark functions as well as an engineering process design problem into consideration we demonstrate the efficacy of a novel classifier-assisted constrained EA towards simultaneous evolutionary search and problem learning .
