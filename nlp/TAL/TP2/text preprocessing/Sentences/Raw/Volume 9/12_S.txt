Selecting and estimating interest rate models with evolutionary methods
Selecting and estimating parsimonious models is often desired but hard to achieve
This is particularly true when models can potentially contain a very large number of parameters but data are scarce as is the case for many macro-economic models in general and interest-rate models in particular
These models need to cater for a large number of potential relationships and dependencies but are fitted on low-frequency data to focus on the bigger picture and long-term effects
To identify the ideal model and estimating it is then particularly demanding from an optimization perspective
In this paper we suggest an evolutionary approach that considers model selection and estimation simultaneously
Numerical experiments with artificial data suggest that the approach is well suited for this type of problem
In an empirical application for short-term and long-term interest rates denominated in US dollar euro and the Japanese yen respectively parsimonious model structures are identified that highlight the dependencies as well as spill-overs across maturities and currencies .
