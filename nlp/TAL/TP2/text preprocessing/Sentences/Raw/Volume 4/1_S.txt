Special issue on modern search heuristics and applications
Since its inception in the early 1980s we have seen a lot of exciting developments in the field of metaheuristics
The complexity of many real-world problems which are often associated with large search spaces real-time performance demands and dynamic environments has made exact solution methods impractical to solve them within a reasonable amount of time
This gives rise to various types of non-exact metaheuristic approaches including the nature-inspired and non nature-inspired ones see 1 4 .
