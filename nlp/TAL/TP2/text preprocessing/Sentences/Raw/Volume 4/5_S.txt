Springer pp 333 368,2009 is a heuristic optimization algorithm based on copying how water forms rivers by eroding the ground and depositing sediments
We apply this method to solve theSteiner tree problem STP a well-known NP-hard problem having applications to areas like telecommunications routing or VLSI design among many others
We show that the gradient orientation of RFD makes it especially suitable for solving this problem and we report the results of several experiments where RFD as well as an implementation ofAnt Colony Optimization ACO Dorigo in ant colony optimization
MIT Press New York 2004 are applied to some benchmark graphs from the SteinLib Testdata Library Koch in Steinlib testdata library
Technical report Konrad-Zuse-Zentrum für Informationstechnik Berlin 2009
We also study the capability of RFD and ACO to deal with a scenario where the graph is modifiedaftera solution is found and next a solution for the new graph has to be found either by running the algorithm from scratch or by adapting the structures previously formed by the algorithms to construct their previous solution .
