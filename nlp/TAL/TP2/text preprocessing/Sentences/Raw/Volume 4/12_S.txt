Co-evolution of lexical and syntactic classifiers during a language game
This paper demonstrates for the first time that a learning classifier system can act as the core of a cognitive architecture to allow agents to co-evolve lexical and syntactic conventions for the efficient communication of conceptual strings during a language game
The use of the learning classifier system has several inherent advantages to previous ad-hoc approaches to modeling language games
It permits incremental addition of new populations of classifiers e. g
syntactic classifiers to modify communicative conventions as necessary without destroying or catastrophically interfering with lower level e. g
lexical conventions
The tendency for learning classifier systems to produce maximally general classifiers automatically produces systematic syntactic conventions
These results provide a proof in principle that replication of classifiers in the brain could serve an important role in cognition as proposed previously by the neuronal replicator hypothesis .
