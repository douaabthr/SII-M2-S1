Parameter control of metaheuristics with genetic fuzzy systems
This paper introduces a genetic fuzzy system for parameter control of metaheuristics
Two basic metaheuristics have been considered as examples genetic algorithm and tabu search
The controlled parameters of the tabu search are the short and long term memories
Parameters of the genetic algorithm under control are the mutation and reproduction rates
Fuzzy rule-based models offer a natural mechanism to describe global behavior as a combination of control rules
They also inherit a means to gradually shift between control rules which jointly defines a control strategy
They are a natural candidate to construct parameter control strategies because they provide a way to develop decision mechanisms based on the specific nature of search regions and transitions between their boundaries
An application example using the classic vehicle routing problem with time windows is included to evaluate the genetic fuzzy system performance
Experimental results show that GFS-controlled metaheuristics improve search behavior and solution quality when compared against standard constant parameters genetic and tabu search approaches
It also provides reasonably good suboptimal solutions faster than specially tailored exact methods reported in the literature .
