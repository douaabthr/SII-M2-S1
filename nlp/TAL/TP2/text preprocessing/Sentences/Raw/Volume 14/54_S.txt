Feedback-based fuzzy resource management in IoT using fog computing
The goal of Internet of Things IoT is to make things wearable devices smart cameras sensors and smart home appliances connect to internet
Large storage is required to store huge volume of data that is generated data processing need to be carried out between IoT devices and the massive number of applications
This process can be made effectively with the help of cloud computing technology
Resources can be effectively utilized with the help of cloud and IoT plays a significant role in managing the tasks that are to be offloaded to the cloud
The performance of the application is to be enhanced by providing Quality of Service QoS and the performance is evaluated in terms of QoS parameters like Power utilization Makespan and Execution Time
The tasks are allocated based on priority
Fog computing paradigm is used in the proposed model to decrease the makespan of time
The projected mechanism is tested and compared with different present systems and is shown that proposed methodology produced effective results .
