Software fault localization using BP neural network based on function and branch coverage
Software failure is inevitable with the increase in scale and complexity of the software
Existing fault localization techniques based on neural networks take statement coverage information and test case execution results into account to train the network
In this paper we propose an effective approach for fault localization based on back-propagation neural network which utilizes branch and function coverage information along with test case execution results to train the network
We investigated our approach using Siemens suite
Our experimental result shows that our proposed approach performs on average 23.50 44.27% better than existing fault localization techniques .
