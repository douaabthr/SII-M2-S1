Multi-objective three level parallel PSO algorithm for structural alignment of complex RNA sequences
This paper introduces a caching enabled parallel multi-objective tri-level particle swarm optimization algorithm MO-3 LPPSO with objective to address a challenging NP-hard problem from bioinformatics i. e
structural alignment of complex RNA sequences
MO-3 LPPSO implements master-slave topology based communication strategy on the parallely connected machines via message passing interface MPI
Level 1 of the proposed algorithm acquires the optimal alignment of the sequences distributed on slave processors in the order of their complexities
Further the aligned sequences along with their alignment scores are stored on the master processor
In the second level the secondary structures of all thegbestaligned sequences of level 1 is obtained
Each sequence set is distributed on a slave processors that constructs secondary structure of all sequences from the set
The alignment scores and secondary structure scores obtained from level 1 and level 2 now move towards level 3 forming a bi-objective optimization problem with the objectives to maximize sequence similarity score and minimize free energy score for most stable RNA secondary structure
The top-level non-dominated solutions are extracted further in level three and the external archive in Ctrie is updated
The improvement from MO-TLPSO to MO-3 LPPSO has been remarkable in the sense inclusion of Ctrie enables the algorithm to work with multi-client environment for handling RNA structural alignment queries implementation of parallelization facilitates structural alignment of highly complex massive datasets of RNA sequences
Further the difference between the time taken by MO-TLPSO and MO-3 LPPSO is found extremely significant as confirmed by non-parametric statistical test Mann-Whitney U test
Further the structural alignment of highly complex sequence sets is performed by MO-3 LPPSO which is tested for prediction accuracy and processing time
The algorithm is found producing highly accurate results at significantly lesser processing time .
