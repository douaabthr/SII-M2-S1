Automated soil prediction using bag-of-features and chaotic spider monkey optimization algorithm
A proper soil prediction is one of the most important parameters to decide the suitable crop which is generally performed manually by the farmers
Therefore the efficiency of the farmers may be increased by producing an automated tools for soil prediction
This paper presents an automated system for categorization of the soil datasets into respective categories using images of the soils which can further be used for the decision of crops
For the same a novel Bag-of-words and chaotic spider monkey optimization based method has been proposed which is used to classify the soil images into its respective categories
The novel chaotic spider monkey optimization algorithm shows desirable convergence and improved global search ability over standard benchmark functions
Hence it has been used to cluster the keypoints in Bag-of-words method for soil prediction
The experimental outcomes illustrate that the anticipated methods effectively classify the soil in comparison to other meta-heuristic based methods .
