Architecture for distributed query processing using the RDF data in cloud environment
From past decade the advancement in the field of RDF data management poses many challenges to researchers
Processing large volumes of RDF data is very difficult task in the cloud
The RDF data actually contains complex graphs along with large number of schemas
Distributing the RDF data with traditional approaches or partitioning them with conventional mechanism leads to faulty distribution as well as generated large number of join operations
To address the above issues this paper developed architecture for distributed query processing using the adaptive hash partitioning approach along with hash join operation
This paper also developed an algorithm for executing the query by minimizing the joins
This paper presented an evaluation of the proposed model with other standard model
The experimental results proved that the proposed method had faster response time compared to the other standard models .
