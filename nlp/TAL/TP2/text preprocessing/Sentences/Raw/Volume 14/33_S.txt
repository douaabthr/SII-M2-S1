Design and analysis of behaviour based DDoS detection algorithm for data centres in cloud
In the recent years security is the major concern in cloud computing
One of the major security threats to the cloud is distributed denial of service DDoS
This DDoS attacks results in data corruption losing of sensitive information and leads to denial of cloud service
To overcome the drawbacks of security we proposed the behaviour-based DDoS detection algorithm that is based on the behaviour of the user which generates the traffic
The proposed work is divided into two phases which can be executed in parallel
In general the hackers or illegitimate user floods the traffic and uses more bandwidth
In first phase the analysis of the dynamic traffic and effectively differentiating the genuine traffic and attacker s traffic is done in the proposed algorithm
The packet analyzer is responsible to identify the genuine packets from the flooding traffic
In second phase the CPU utilization is monitored and the process consuming more CPU power or the source is illegitimate the process is rejected
The simulation is carried by using the OPNET simulator
The simulation results are tested with three different scenarios
It is proved that the proposed model has efficient response time and it has better efficiency in DDoS prone zones .
