On the cryptanalysis of S-DES using nature inspired optimization algorithms
Cryptanalysis has emerged to be an important topic in the era of modern emerging technologies
The cryptanalysis of Simplified Data Encryption Standard S-DES is a NP-Hard combinatorial problem
This paper has two goals
Firstly we study the cryptanalysis of S-DES via nature-inspired meta-heuristic algorithms namely Cuckoo Search Firefly and Black-Hole Optimization Algorithms
Each of these algorithms is based on fascinating natural phenomena and exploits the inherent uniqueness of such phenomena to solve optimization problems
Secondly we present a comparative study on the efficiency of these three fairly new algorithms with that of previously established Memetic Algorithm and Genetic Algorithms in regard to S-DES cryptanalysis
Through experimentations and extensive tests it has been shown that the proposed algorithm based on Cuckoo Search proves to be most efficient with respect to accuracy and execution time .
