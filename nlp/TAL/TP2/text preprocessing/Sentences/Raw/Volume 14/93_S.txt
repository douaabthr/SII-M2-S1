A deep contractive autoencoder for solving multiclass classification problems
Contractive auto encoder CAE is on of the most robust variant of standard Auto Encoder AE
The major drawback associated with the conventional CAE is its higher reconstruction error during encoding and decoding process of input features to the network
This drawback in the operational procedure of CAE leads to its incapability of going into finer details present in the input features by missing the information worth consideration
Resultantly the features extracted by CAE lack the true representation of all the input features and the classifier fails in solving classification problems efficiently
In this work an improved variant of CAE is proposed based on layered architecture following feed forward mechanism named as deep CAE
In the proposed architecture the normal CAEs are arranged in layers and inside each layer the process of encoding and decoding take place
The features obtained from the previous CAE are given as inputs to the next CAE
Each CAE in all layers are responsible for reducing the reconstruction error thus resulting in obtaining the informative features
The feature set obtained from the last CAE is given as input to the softmax classifier for classification
The performance and efficiency of the proposed model has been tested on five MNIST variant-datasets
The results have been compared with standard SAE DAE RBM SCAE ScatNet and PCANet in term of training error testing error and execution time
The results revealed that the proposed model outperform the aforementioned models .
