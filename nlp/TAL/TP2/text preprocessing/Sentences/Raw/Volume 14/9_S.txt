MC/DC guided Test Sequence Prioritization using Firefly Algorithm
Optimization of the regression testing process has been playing an important role in developing quality software
Still it is difficult to achieve satisfactory results on the generation of non-redundant and optimized test sequences
There are many optimization techniques applied to regression testing
Firefly algorithm FA has gained its popularity as an optimization technique to provide better solutions in the areas of science and engineering
But the original FA needs to have a better or modified objective function
This work uses FA with an improvised objective function to generate optimal test paths guided by Modified Condition/Decision Coverage MC/DC criteria in the form of a guided matrix
This matrix is built with MC/DC influence values that we obtained from the predicate nodes of control flow graph CFG
This guided matrix also helps in measuring the fault-finding potential of a node
It also helps in routing fireflies to move between the nodes of a CFG
We have chosen MC/DC criteria as it is the second strongest code coverage criteria due to its linear time complexity
Then FA is used by defining an appropriate objective function to traverse the graph using fireflies
We obtain optimal test sequences after executing the FA
These test sequences are ranked by computing the mean brightness of nodes along a path and then prioritized based on their ranks
Our simulation and comparison are validated by experimenting on several moderate sized Java programs .
