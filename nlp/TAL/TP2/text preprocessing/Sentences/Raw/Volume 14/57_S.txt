Intrusion detection system for cloud forensics using bayesian fuzzy clustering and optimization based SVNN
Intrusion detection has emerged as one of the major challenges involved in the cloud forensics
This work introduces an intrusion detection framework for the cloud environment with clustering and two-level classifiers
In the first step of the process a Bayesian fuzzy clustering is used for clustering the nodes in the cloud
And in the next step two-level gravitational group search-based support vector neural network GG-SVNN classifier identifies intrusion in clusters
GG-SVNN is a novel optimization scheme proposed in this work by combining the group search optimizer and gravitational search algorithm
The intrusion information provided by level 1 classifier is arranged to form compact data and provided to the level 2 classifier
The level 2 classifier finally identifies total nodes affected by the intruders
The simulation of the proposed intrusion detection is done with the help of KDD cup dataset
From the simulation results it is evident that the proposed GG-SVNN classifier has achieved overall best performance by achieving high accuracy value of 92.41% and low false alarm rate of 4.75% respectively .
