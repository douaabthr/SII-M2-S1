Threshold estimation from software metrics by using evolutionary techniques and its proposed algorithms models
The software metrics play the important role in the software industry
As the software industry growing in size and complexity enhanced support is mandatory for computing and managing the software quality
Quality measurement is one of the key features of the manager in the software industry where threshold plays the crucial role
Software measurement is necessary by means for evaluating different quality attributes and characteristics such as size complexity maintainability and usability
Instead of that effective and efficient software system is straightforward dependent on the meaning of suitable thresholds
The objective of this paper is to estimate the threshold values from software metrics by using novel evolutionary intelligence techniques
The threshold and aging software design optimization algorithms and models to prevent software aging by using machine learning evolutionary algorithms
Apart from the above-mentioned techniques this paper also proposed a novel threshold estimation aging and survivability aware sensitive reusability optimization model of an object-oriented software system
To expand firmness aging and survivability aware sensitive optimization threshold scheme aging prediction and software rejuvenation model and algorithms proposed .
