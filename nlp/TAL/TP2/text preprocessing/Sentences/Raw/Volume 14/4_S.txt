Fuzzy clustering algorithm based on modified whale optimization algorithm for automobile insurance fraud detection
Fuzzy c-means FCM clustering method is used for performing the task of clustering
This method is the most widely used among various clustering techniques
However it gets easily stuck in the local optima
whale optimization algorithm WOA is a stochastic global optimization algorithm which is used to find out global optima of a provided dataset
The WOA is further modified to achieve better global optimum
In this paper a fuzzy clustering method has been proposed by using the strengths of both modified whale optimization algorithm MWOA and FCM
The effectiveness of the proposed clustering technique is evaluated by considering some of the well-known existing metrics
The proposed hybrid clustering method based on MWOA is employed as an under sampling method to optimize the cluster centroids in the proposed automobile insurance fraud detection system AIFDS
In the AIFDS first the majority sample data set is trimmed by removing the outliers using proposed fuzzy clustering method and then the modified dataset is undergone with some advanced classifiers such as CATBoost XGBoost Random Forest LightGBM and Decision Tree
The classifiers are evaluated by measuring the performance parameters such as sensitivity specificity and accuracy
The proposed AIFDS consisting of fuzzy clustering based on MWOA and CATBoost performs better than other compared methods .
