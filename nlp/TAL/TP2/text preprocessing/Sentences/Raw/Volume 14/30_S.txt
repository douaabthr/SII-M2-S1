Categorization of Intercloud users and auto-scaling of resources
Optimal allocation of resources in Intercloud computing is NP-complete program
Constraints are many and configuration of each cloud varies from each other
The mapping of the tasks to available virtual machines is challenging
In real life scenarios customer requirements may change
The complexity of the problem increases as requirement changes in terms of capacity speed and time
To tide overfrequent changes in customer requirement and optimum utilization of available resources a heuristic algorithm is proposed which will fit to the specification
The proposed algorithm is primarily divided into three phases namely categorization of users genetic algorithm-based resource allocation and earliest deadline first scheduling
The objective is to map the tasks to be executed to available VMs of the multi-cloud federation in order to have minimum makespan time and maximum customer satisfaction
After pr simulation on synthetic data compared the simulation results with the existing scheduling algorithm
Results of the simulation confirm that the proposed categorization of the user in cloud domain can be beneficial in many folds and can address the existing challenges as per concerned metrics .
