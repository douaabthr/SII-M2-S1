Massive MIMO perspective improved sea lion for optimal antenna selection
The massive MIMO is an advanced technology in the wideband wireless communication system s future which provokes extensive attention in both academia and telecommunication industry
Pilot contamination is considered as a fundamental issue in the system of massive MIMO
The designing of wireless systems has the main concern over the system throughput
Though the environmental protection and energy-saving have concerned as inevitable trends and global demands
Hence on considering all these consequences this paper intends to introduce a new improved sea lion optimization algorithm to select the optimal transmit antennas selection by accounting the multi-objective issue that maximizes both the relative energy efficiency and capacity
In fact the proposed algorithm is the enhanced version of traditional sea lion optimization algorithm which optimally tunes the count of transmit antennas and determines which antenna to be selected
Finally the performance of proposed work is compared and proved over other conventional models regarding capacity analysis relative efficiency analysis and optimal antenna selection analysis as well .
