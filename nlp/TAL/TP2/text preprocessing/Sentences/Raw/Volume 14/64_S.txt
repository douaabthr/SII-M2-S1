FPA clust evaluation of the flower pollination algorithm for data clustering
In this work a standalone approach based on the flower pollination algorithm FPA is proposed for solving data clustering problems
The FPA is a nature-inspired algorithm simulating the behavior of flower pollination
The proposed approach is used to extract key information in terms of optimal cluster centers that are derived from training samples of the selected databases
These extracted cluster centers are then validated on test samples
Three datasets from the UCI machine learning data repository and an additional multi-spectral real-time satellite image are chosen to illustrate the effectiveness and diversity of the proposed technique
The FPA performance is compared with the k-means a popular clustering algorithm and metaheuristic algorithms namely the Genetic Algorithm Particle Swarm Optimization Cuckoo Search Spider Monkey Optimization Grey Wolf Optimization Differential Evolution Harmony Search and Bat Algorithm
The results are evaluated based on classification error percentage CEP time complexity and statistical significance
FPA has the lowest CEP for all four datasets and an average CEP of 28% which is 5.5% lower than next best algorithm in that sense
The FPA is the second quickest algorithm to converge after HS algorithm
FPA also shows a higher level of statistical significance
Therefore the obtained results show that the FPA efficiently clusters the data and performs better than the state-of-the-art methods .
