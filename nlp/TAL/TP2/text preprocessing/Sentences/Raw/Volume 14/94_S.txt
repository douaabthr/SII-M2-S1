A new Pareto multi-objective sine cosine algorithm for performance enhancement of radial distribution network by optimal allocation of distributed generators
The integration of distributed generators DGs is considered to be one of the best cost-effective techniques to improve the efficiency of power distribution systems in the recent deregulation caused by continuous load demand and transmission system contingency
In this perspective a new multi-objective sine cosine algorithm is proposed for optimal DG allocation in radial distribution systems with minimization of total active power loss maximization of voltage stability index minimization of annual energy loss costs as well as pollutant gas emissions without violating the system and DG operating constraints
The proposed algorithm is enhanced by incorporating exponential variation of the conversion parameter and the self-adapting levy mutation to increase its performance during different iteration phases
The contradictory relationships among the objectives motivate the authors to generate an optimal Pareto set in order to help the network operators in taking fast appropriate decisions
The proposed approach is successfully applied to 33 bus and 69 bus distribution systems under four practical load conditions and is evaluated in different two-objective and three-objective optimization cases
The effectiveness of the algorithm is confirmed by comparing the results against other well-known multi-objective algorithms namely strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm 2 non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II and multi-objective particle swarm optimization
The quality of Pareto fronts from different multi-objective algorithms is compared in terms of certain performance indicators such as generational distance spacing metric and spread metric varDelta and its statistical significance is verified by performing Wilcoxon signed rank test .
