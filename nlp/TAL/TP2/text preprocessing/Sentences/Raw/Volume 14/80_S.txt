A review of genetic-based evolutionary algorithms in SVM parameters optimization
Parameters optimization is a research hotspot of SVM and has gained increasing interest from various research fields
Compared with other optimization algorithms genetic-based evolutionary algorithms that have achieved optimization according to the laws of separation and free combination in genetics are gradually attracted much attention
Also due to the characteristics of self-organization and self-adaptation these algorithms often enable SVM to obtain appropriate parameters so that the model can be applied to more applications
Additionally many improvements have been proposed in the past two decades in order to allow the optimized SVM model to obtain better performance
This work focuses on reviewing the current state of genetic-based evolutionary algorithms used to optimize parameters of SVM and its variants
First we introduce the principles of SVM and provide a survey on optimization methods of its parameters
Then we propose a taxonomy of improving genetic-based evolutionary algorithms according to code mechanism parameters control population structure evolutionary strategy operation mechanism operators and many other hybrid approaches
Furthermore this paper analyzes and compares the advantages and disadvantages of the above algorithms explicitly and provides their applicable scenarios as well
Finally we highlight the existing problems of genetic-based evolutionary algorithms used for parameters optimization of SVM and prospect development trends of this field in the future .
