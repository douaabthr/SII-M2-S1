Hybridizing ant lion with whale optimization algorithm for compressed sensing MR image reconstruction vial1minimization an ALWOA strategy
In the field of image compression the compressed sensing image reconstruction has made great achievements due to proper use of the image sparsity without the Nyquist sampling law constraint
For image information distribution great deals of researches indicate that there exists obvious structural and statistical prior s regularity and by the traditional compression algorithm it is difficult to achieve
In this paper we propose a compressed sensing image reconstruction algorithm based on hybrid ALWOA strategy which combines the ant lion optimization algorithm and the whale optimization algorithm
The hybrid algorithm produces a global search with faster convergence
By continuously learning the proposed hybrid method can find optimal solutions
The objective function for the image reconstruction process is taken as thel1minimization problem
The reconstructed image is obtained by solving thel1minimization problem
Extensive simulations have been conducted and the results show that the proposed method has achieved better performance when compared with traditional reconstruction algorithms .
