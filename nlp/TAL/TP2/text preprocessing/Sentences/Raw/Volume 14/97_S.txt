Opposition based competitive grey wolf optimizer for EMG feature selection
This paper proposes a competitive grey wolf optimizer CGWO to solve the feature selection problem in electromyography EMG pattern recognition
We model the recently established feature selection method competitive binary grey wolf optimizer CBGWO into a continuous version CGWO which enables it to perform the search on continuous search space
Moreover another new variant of CGWO namely opposition based competitive grey wolf optimizer OBCGWO is proposed to enhance the performance of CGWO in feature selection
The proposed methods show superior results in several benchmark function tests
As for EMG feature selection the proposed algorithms are evaluated using the EMG data acquired from the publicly access EMG database
Initially several useful features are extracted from the EMG signals to construct the feature set
The proposed CGWO and OBCGWO are then applied to select the relevant features from the original feature set
Four state-of-the-art algorithms include particle swarm optimization flower pollination algorithm butterfly optimization algorithm and CBGWO are used to examine the effectiveness of proposed methods in feature selection
The experimental results show that OBCGWO can provide optimal classification performance which is suitable for rehabilitation and clinical applications .
