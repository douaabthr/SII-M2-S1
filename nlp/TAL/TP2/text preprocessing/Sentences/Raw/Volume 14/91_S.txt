Distributed-elite local search based on a genetic algorithm for bi-objective job-shop scheduling under time-of-use tariffs
The rapid growth of electricity demand has led governments around the world to implement energy-conscious policies such as time-of-use tariffs
The manufacturing sector can embrace these policies by implementing an innovative scheduling system to reduce its energy consumption
Therefore this study addresses bi-objective job-shop scheduling with total weighted tardiness and electricity cost minimization under time-of-use tariffs
The problem can be decomposed into two sub-problems operation sequencing and start time determination
To solve this problem we propose a distributed-elite local search based on a genetic algorithm that uses local improvement strategies based on the distribution of elites
Specifically chromosome encoding uses two lines of gene representation corresponding to the operation sequence and start time
We propose a decoding method to obtain a schedule that incorporates operation sequencing and start time
A perturbation scheme to reduce electricity costs was developed
Finally a local search framework based on the distribution of elites is used to guide the selection of individuals and the determination of perturbation
Comprehensive numerical experiments using benchmark data from the literature demonstrate that the proposed method is more effective than NSGA-II MOEA/D and SPEA2
The results presented in this work may be useful for the manufacturing sector to adopt the time-of-use tariffs policy .
