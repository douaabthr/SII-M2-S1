Study on the influence of different menu sizes on the operation performance of touch screen
The key size of the touchscreen menu will significantly affect the user s operation experience and task completion performance
This paper explores the influence of different shortcut menu sizes on users operation performance in the touch-screen application situations with two tilting angles 6.6 circ hbox and 18 circ
The results show that the tilt angles of the two display screens have no significant influence on the response time of operators and the change trend of menu size
When the shortcut menu size is less than 2.5 times 2.5 hbox cm the operator s response time increases significantly with the reduction of shortcut menu size
When the shortcut menu size is more than 2.5 times 2.5 hbox cm the increase of size has no significant impact on the operator s response time
The shortcut menu recommends sizes between 2.0 times 2.0 hbox cm and 2.5 times 2.5 hbox cm with 2.25 times 2.25 hbox cm being a key size value
