Study on the influence of different color temperature and illumination environment on cognitive processing depth
Indoor lighting environment has an impact on people s physiology psychology cognition and other aspects thus affecting people s work tasks and work efficiency
This paper studies the effects of different color temperature and illumination conditions on cognitive processing depth
The experimental results show that different screen brightness has significant influence on information processing ability under three light environments dark white and yellow
The performance of tasks with different processing depth is different under different light environmental conditions
High brightness display and color matching style of night vision interface is recommended in dark environment
High brightness display is recommended in yellow light environment In white light medium brightness display and white interface matching style are recommended .
