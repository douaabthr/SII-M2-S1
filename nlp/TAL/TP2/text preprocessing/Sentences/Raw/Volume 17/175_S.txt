Positioning of new mobile tower using Circle Packing Problem
The Circle Packing Problem determines a circle of the largest area that can fit into the vacant space when varvec n arbitrary-sized non-overlapping given circles are placed inside a given container
One of its numerous applications is to determine the optimal positioning of mobile towers in a city
This constrained nonlinear optimization problem is solved using four variants of the Real Coded Genetic Algorithm
These four variants are created by the combination of two well-known real-coded crossover operators Arithmetic Crossover and Hybrid Crossover and two well-known real-coded mutation operators Uniform Mutation and Discrete Uniform Mutation
The performance of these algorithms is evaluated using the mean standard deviation best worst of the objective function values and Friedman s mean ranking test is applied when 30 runs of each variants are carried out
On the basis of the computational analysis the performance of the variant of RCGA having Arithmetic Crossover-Uniform Mutation AX-UM outperforms all other RCGAs considered in this study in terms of faster convergence and better accuracy of the solution
In a practical demonstration this methodology is implemented to a case study in Roorkee City in Uttarakhand of Northen India
Currently there are 14 existing mobile towers in Roorkee city
However there are certain regions in which internet connectivity is unsatisfactory
Therefore based on the recommendation of this study AX-UM is recommended to install three new mobile towers .
