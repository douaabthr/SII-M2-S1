Topological localization approach for efficient energy management of WSN
The energy management problem is an inevitable issue with the wireless sensor network WSN
There is always a need for an energy-conscious model for WSN that will prolong the network lifetime during system execution
Commonly the WSN is distributed in nature as it is used for several applications like localization surveillance and object tracking
In such a scenario energy management is even more critical
In this regard we propose an energy-efficient topological localization technique called CLOCK Localization Approach CLA that ensures a long lifetime of WSN by eliminating recurrent reclustering and iterative cluster head CH selection
CLA follows a CLOCK pattern-based sensor deployment strategy where the selected CHs play a dual role of CH and Vice-CH
It helps to reduce energy consumption and overhead issue
The simulation result shows that the outperformance of the CLA algorithm in comparison to low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy-centralized LEACH-C and base station controlled dynamic clustering protocol BCDCP .
