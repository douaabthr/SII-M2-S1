An intelligent quasi-oppositional HBO technique to solve non-smooth non-convex economic dispatch problem
In this paper a modified heap-based optimization HBO known as the quasi-oppositional heap-based optimization QOHBO method is endeavored to tackle the challenging problem of non-convex economic load dispatch problem ELDP in large-scale power systems
The QOHBO method leverages a heap data structure to emulate the concept of corporate ranking hierarchy
The mathematical model of HBO is based on the three strategies first the interaction between subordinates and their direct superior second interactions between contemporaries third the employees self-contribution is adopted to perform both the exploration and exploitation in the search space
To enhance the solution quality and computational efficiency in solving ELDP we integrate the concept of quasi-oppositional learning into HBO
The proposed QOHBO technique effectively addresses various constraints including transmission line losses valve-point loading effects generator generation limits prohibited operating zones power demand compliance and ramp rate limits
The feasibility of the QOHBO to solve ELDP is evaluated by conducting ten distinct case studies across nine diverse test systems featuring generating units ranging from three to 140
Comparative analysis with existing techniques from the literature highlights the superior performance of our proposed method in solving large-scale ELD problems
Subsequently non-parametric alternative tests specifically the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and the Friedman test has been conducted to verify the efficacy of the proposed QOHBO
Moreover extensive statistical analysis reveals that the QOHBO technique has the ability to consistently provide quality solutions and its robustness when compared to other state-of-the-art approaches .
