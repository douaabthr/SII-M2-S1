Study on the evolution of hot topics in the urban development
Urbanization is crucially important for people to improve the quality of life
Thus it is of importance to study the evolution of hot topics to explore the functions of cities for meeting the increasing demands of people
In this paper we explored the semantic analysis of hot topics and trends in urban studies from the literature which provides a research direction for future studies
Based on articles collected from the Science Citation Index Expanded and Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science databases from 2000 to 2016 we found that the number of urban studies increased in stability during that time
Followed by England and China USA was the largest contributor for studies in this field
Based on the keywords and abstracts of these articles we extracted the topics of the study using a clustering method and topic model and calculated the hot values of the topics
Finally we obtained 15 hot topics in the field of urban studies among which city school regional economic and estate were the hottest topics that indicated the focus of the research study
An anomaly detection method was used to analyze the change trend of topics hot values and we found that the hot value of these topics overall were on the rise especially urban education and urban planning increased significantly which indicated that they attracted an increasing amount of scholars attention but the hot value of health and Gis decreased significantly recently which suggested that research interest in these two topics is decreasing .
