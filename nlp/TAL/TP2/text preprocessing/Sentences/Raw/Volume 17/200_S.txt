Discrete Marine Predators Algorithm for Symmetric Travelling Salesman Problem
This paper addresses the well-known NP-hard problem the Symmetric Travelling Salesman Problem STSP which has numerous applications in logistics and graph theory
To solve this complex problem a discrete version of the Marine Predators Algorithm D-MPA is introduced
Although MPA has been extensively studied for various optimization problems and real-world applications its use in routing problems particularly TSP remains relatively unexplored
To adapt MPA for STSP the positions of individuals are initially updated using the classical MPA algorithm
The continuous values generated by the classical MPA are then converted to discrete values followed by the application of a permutation operator to maintain diversity in the population
In addition a local search algorithm 2 opt is applied to further improve the results for STSP instances
The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on STSP benchmark instances of sizes ranging from 14 to 439
The performance of D-MPA is compared against several existing algorithms including the Genetic Algorithm GA Bat Algorithm BA Discrete Firefly Algorithm DFA Evolutionary Simulated Annealing ESA Island-Based Distributed Genetic Algorithm IDGA Discrete Imperialist Competitive Algorithm DICA and Discrete Grey Wolf Optimization DGWO
To ensure an unbiased and rigorous comparison descriptive statistics such as mean and standard deviation are used and a Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test is conducted for statistical validation
The results demonstrate that D-MPA not only competes but also consistently outperforms these algorithms making it a valuable resource for the research community .
