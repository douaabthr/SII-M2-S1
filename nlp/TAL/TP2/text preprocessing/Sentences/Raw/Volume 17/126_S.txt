Performance assessment of the main metaheuristics for sustainable supply chains
The sustainable supply chains optimization is a high-dimensional multi-objective optimization problem
The involved costs can be categorized as economic environmental and social
Metaheuristics can be used for tackling this kind of problem efficiently
This short note deals with a comparative analysis of the main metaheuristics according to recent surveys for a sustainable supply chain model
The considered techniques are genetic algorithm particle swarm optimization simulated annealing and non-dominated sorted genetic algorithm
Moreover two hybrid models are also included i. e
genetic algorithm combined with simulated annealing and genetic algorithm combined with particle swarm optimization
The latter provides the best result with a constraint satisfaction rate equal to 0.9968 .
