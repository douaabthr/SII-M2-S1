Energy aware cluster-based routing in WSN using hybrid pelican-blue monkey optimization algorithm
As the nodes in wireless sensor networks WSNs are powered by batteries energy efficiency is a major concern
Since communication consumes the most energy efficient routing becomes an effective solution
A typical routing strategy is to use hierarchical clustering algorithms
In hierarchical routing schemes a clustered arrangement of sensor nodes SNs is used to facilitate data merging and aggregation
The Cluster heads are in charge of obtaining data from the cluster s SNs and gathering and delivering the data they receive at BS
These data are combined and pooled at the Cluster head CH level resulting in considerable energy savings
However there are certain reliability issues in cluster head selection CHS and optimal routing
To model a CHS and optimal routing in WSN this work carries out the CHS using improved kernel Fuzzy C means clustering for selecting the CH by considering energy and distance
Then optimal routing is done by deploying a novel optimization scheme named Customized Pelican with Blue Monkey Optimization CP-BMO which offers the optimal routes by considering trust and risk constraints
Also the CP-BMO model holds better energy consumption which is 35.65% 29.42% 38.79% 25.31% 39.85% 39.16% 9.55% 29.39% 39.32% and 39.32% superior to ABO RHSO PELICAN BMO F-FLY AEFA ML-AEFA ETERS GA and QOBOA respectively
At last the simulation outcomes confirm the developed approach s effectiveness on PDR network lifetime etc .
