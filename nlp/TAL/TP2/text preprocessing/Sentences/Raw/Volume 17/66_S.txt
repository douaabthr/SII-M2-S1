A novel two-phase hybrid selection mechanism feeder to improve performance of many-objective optimization algorithms
Solving many-objective optimization problems has become one of the most popular research areas in recent years due to its ever-increasing applications in industries and other fields
In this paper a novel two-phase hybrid feeder TPHF is proposed to provide elite solutions for selection mechanism of many-objective optimization algorithms MaOAs to improve their performance
The proposed TPHF framework generates solutions using a novel particle swarm optimization PSO operator along with a genetic algorithm operator during a two-phase calculated search based on the average velocity of the PSO particles
TPHF focuses on the worst solutions of the population to find a better place for them
Therefore it frequently resets the PSO particles to the worst solutions
The new PSO operator uses the novel idea of dynamic inertia and learning factors and a novel velocity update equation
The classic global bests set of the classic PSO operator is replaced by a PSO feeder which uses the novel idea of using groups of the best/worst solutions to feed the new PSO operator based on the phase of the search
The proposed TPHF is applied to some of the most famous and state-of-the-art MaOAs with their corresponding default parameters
The result of the comparison between these MaOAs with their corresponding TPHF versions on MaF test suite shows a significant improvement in the performance of the TPHF versions in 62.2% of the cases . Graphical abstract
