The improved grasshopper optimization algorithm with Cauchy mutation strategy and random weight operator for solving optimization problems
An improved grasshopper optimization algorithm GOA is proposed in this paper termed CMRWGOA which combines both Random Weight shorted RWGOA and Cauchy mutation termed CMGOA mechanism into the GOA
The GOA received inspiration from the foraging and swarming habits of grasshoppers
The performance of the CMRWGOA was validated by 23 benchmark functions in comparison with four well-known meta-heuristic algorithms AHA DA GOA and MVO CMGOA RWGOA and the GOA
The non-parametric Wilcoxon Friedman and Nemenyi statistical tests are conducted on the CMRWGOA
Furthermore the CMRWGOA has been evaluated in three real-life challenging optimization problems as a complementary study
Various strictly extensive experimental results reveal that the CMRWGOA exhibit better performance .
