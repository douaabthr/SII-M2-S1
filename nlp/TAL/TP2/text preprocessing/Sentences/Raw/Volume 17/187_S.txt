A novel giant pacific octopus optimizer for real-world engineering problem
Giant Pacific Octopus Optimizer GPOO a new swarm computational-intelligence metaheuristic approach is a natural algorithm based on the behavior of octopuses as they struggle to live in the environment
The GPOO model which are two primary techniques searching and attacking prey are offered for algorithm optimization
The transitions between the exploration and exploitation stages are handled in a way that strikes an appropriate balance
A numerous of tests are carried out to verify the novel optimization process s capacity to identify the best solutions to different optimization issues
The GPOO model is evaluated using 10 complex benchmark functions for CEC2019 and 23 classical benchmark functions
Additionally the results are compared to other metaheuristic algorithms
Globally algorithms are also employed to address practical engineering technical issues
The outcomes show that GPOO demonstrates other comparable methods in terms of convergence speed and successfully locates all or most local/global optima .
