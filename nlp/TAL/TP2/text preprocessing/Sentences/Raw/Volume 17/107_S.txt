Multi-objective optimum design of propellers using the blade element theory and evolutionary algorithms
A multi-objective optimum design of propellers is presented
Traditionally the definition of propellers is done by choosing models that already exist on the market
However with the advancement of technologies such as 3D printing and computer numerical control the possibility for the designer to seek an optimized propeller for his design is increasingly feasible
In this scenario this paper aims to propose a methodology that allows the designer to find alternative propeller designs
The methodology comprises the creation refinement and extension of an airfoil database available from the literature
The aerodynamic analysis uses the blade element theory and the optimization with evolutionary algorithms
Seven multi-objective constrained optimization problems were formulated with two three and four conflicting objective functions concerning the propeller aerodynamic and geometric information such as the thrust coefficient the bending coefficient the efficiency and the volume of the propeller
Among them for instance two proposed formulations are i maximizing the thrust and minimizing the bending coefficients simultaneously ii maximizing the thrust coefficient minimizing the bending coefficient minimizing the volume of the propeller and minimizing the efficiency simultaneously
The experiments analyzed the optimization of small propellers for two different engines combustion and electric brushless
Five evolutionary algorithms were used to solve these problems and solutions were extracted from the Pareto fronts using multi-criteria decision-making according to the decision-maker preferences
Finally the complete data of the extracted solutions are provided such as dimensions angles shapes and performance characteristics .
