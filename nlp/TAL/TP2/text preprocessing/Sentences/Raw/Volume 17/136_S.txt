Bilevel optimization based on foraging by different ant species for real-time transportation planning
Initiating a transportation process during heavy traffic conditions or adverse weather conditions has a retracting impact on the cost even if the transit path chosen is optimal
This paper proposes an algorithmic framework for a dynamic transportation process using a bilevel multi-objective optimization approach
Dynamic detection of road traffic measures comes at an upper level and optimal path estimation comes at the lower level of the bilevel model
Aggregation of multiple objectives traffic distance and quality of the path is done to formulate the objective function at a lower level
The intelligent foraging behaviour of different ant species inspires a bilevel optimization model for the specific problem
The upper-level task of detecting the dynamic traffic measure is based on a foraging strategy of harvester ants which use antennal contacts to exchange information with inmates regarding food availability
The lower-level objective of determining the optimal route is based on the pheromone trail-based communication strategy used by other species of ants
Simulation results obtained manifest the potential nature of the proposed method in the real-time transportation process .
