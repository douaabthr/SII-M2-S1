Design optimization of cam follower mechanisms using Rao algorithms and their variants
This paper presents the design optimization of cam follower mechanisms CFM with eccentric roller type follower using recently developed advanced optimization algorithms namely Rao SAMP-Rao and QO-Rao algorithms
Four types of follower motion law i.e. cycloidal modified harmonic 3 4 5 degree polynomial and 4 5 6 7 degree polynomial motion are considered
The CFM is optimized to minimize three objectives such as the input torque needed to rotate the cam the radius of the pitch circle of the cam and the maximum contact stress
The problem has five continuous design variables namely the roller radius Rg the radius of cam base circle Rb the distance between the follower bearing and the center of the cam q the eccentricity of the follower e and the length of follower bearing b
Eight design constraints related to the geometry of the cam mechanism the pressure angle the efficiency of the mechanism the curvature radius of the pitch curve and the maximum contact stress are considered
The computational results obtained using Rao algorithms and their variants are compared with other advanced optimization algorithms such as the salp swarm algorithm SSA ant lion optimizer ALO moth flame optimization MFO multi verse optimizer MVO evaporation rate water cycle algorithm ER-WCA grey wolf optimizer GWO and mine blast algorithm MBA
The comparison of optimization results reveals that the optimum value of a fitness function obtained using Rao algorithms and their variants is superior to GWO ALO MFO SSA ER-WCA MBA and MVO for all four cases considered
The optimum fitness function value of the CFM with case III is reduced by 3.14% 4.13% and 7.61% compared to the CFM s fitness function value with the case I case II and case IV respectively
Hence the 3 4 5 degree polynomial motion of the follower is effective for better performance of the CFM
Also the average time required for Rao algorithms and their variants is comparatively significantly less than the other algorithms considered
The effectiveness of Rao algorithms and their variants will help the community to improve the optimum solutions to their problems in their respective research field
Also Rao algorithms will decrease the researchers efforts required to tune the algorithm-specific control parameters as these algorithms do not have algorithm-specific control parameters
Furthermore the Friedman rank test proves the significance of the statistical results acquired using Rao algorithms and their variants .
