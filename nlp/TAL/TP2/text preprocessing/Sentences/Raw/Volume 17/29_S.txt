Node capability dependency importance evaluation of heterogeneous target operational network
It is very important to identify the important nodes in heterogeneous target operational network HTON for target selection
Traditional methods such as centrality based methods only consider either network structures or node features to evaluate the importance of nodes
However these methods ignore the rich semantic information between nodes formed by complex physical and logical relations
To solve this problem we propose a novel node capability dependency importance evaluation method considering meta-path and capability dependency called NCDI
Meta-path is an effective method of semantic capture different meta-paths express different semantic informations
Some nodes could support or control other nodes inter-node dependency can also be used as an indicator of importance evaluation
Compared to the degree centrality and other typical evaluation methods the results show that our method can sort the node importance more effectively in HTON .
