Reduce task execution time in heterogeneous distributed systems using improved COA algorithm
Task scheduling in heterogeneous distributed systems is an NP-complete problem which using exact algorithms it is not possible to achieve the optimal solution at the right time to solve it
In such cases meta-heuristic algorithms can be effective
On the other hand in the matter of scheduling creating a balance between maximizing parallelism and minimizing communication cost is one of the main goals
In this paper an improved COA algorithm has been used to schedule tasks in heterogeneous distributed systems and to increase parallelism and reduce communication cost
The improved COA algorithm considers a larger number of eggs for the sample that has the highest fit after the cuckoo laying stage and the samples are identified
Three standard graphs FFT Gaussian and molecular were used to evaluate the proposed model
Experimental results indicate that SLR speedup and performance have improved with mapping in these three standard graphs
The results totally show 5.91% improvement comparing the MOSCOA 4.4% comparing EGA-TS and also 3.86% comparing E-COA so they show that improving the above criteria leads to reducing the total execution time and improving the performance of the COA algorithm .
