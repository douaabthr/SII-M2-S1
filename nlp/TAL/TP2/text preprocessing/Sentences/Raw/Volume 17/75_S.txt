Many-objective optimization of wireless sensor network deployment
Recently the efficient deployment of wireless sensor networks WSNs has become a leading field of research in WSN design optimization
Practical scenarios related to WSN deployment are often considered as optimization models with multiple conflicting objectives that are simultaneously enhanced
In the related literature it had been shown that moving from mono-objective to multi-objective resolution of WSN deployment is beneficial
However since the deployment of real-world WSNs encompasses more than three objectives a multi-objective optimization may harm other deployment criteria that are conflicting with the already considered ones
Thus our aim is to go further explore the modeling and the resolution of WSN deployment in a many-objective i.e. optimization with more than three objectives fashion and especially exhibit its added value
In this context we first propose a many-objective deployment model involving seven conflicting objectives and then we solve it using an adaptation of the Decomposition-based Evolutionary Algorithm theta DEA
The developed adaptation is named WSN theta DEA and is validated through a detailed experimental study .
