SELF a stacked-based ensemble learning framework for breast cancer classification
Nowadays breast cancer is the most prevalent and jeopardous disease in women after lung cancer
During the past few decades a substantial amount of cancer cases have been reported throughout the world
Breast cancer has been a widely acknowledged category of cancer disease in women due to the lack of awareness
According to the world cancer survey report 2020 about 2.3 million cases and 685,000 deaths have been reported worldwide
As the patient-doctor ratio PDR is very high consequently there is an utmost need for a machine-based intelligent breast cancer diagnosis system that can detect cancer at its early stage and cure it more efficiently
The plan is to assemble scientists in both the restorative and the machine learning fields to progress toward this clinical application
This paper presents SELF a stacked-based ensemble learning framework to classify breast cancer at an early stage from the histopathological images of tumor cells with computer-aided diagnosis tools
In this work we use the BreakHis dataset with 7909 histopathological images and Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database WBCD with 569 instances for the performance evaluation of our proposed framework
We have trained several distinct classifiers on both datasets and selected the best five classifiers on the basis of their accuracy measure to create our ensemble model
We use the stacking ensemble technique and consider the Extra tree Random Forest AdaBoost Gradient Boosting and KNN9 classifiers as the base learners and the logistic regression model as a final estimator
We have evaluated the performance of SELF on the BreakHis dataset and WBCD datasets and achieved testing accuracy of approximately 95% and 99% respectively
The result of the other performance parameters on the BreakHis and the WBCD datasets also showed that our proposed framework outperforms with F1-Score ROC and MCC scores .
