A practical method for the expert academic personas classification based on text classifier
The expert academic personas classification are indispensable for expert intelligent automatic recommendation
It can also be applied to academic evaluation character knowledge base construction and so on
The paper introduces a text classifier trained for the personas of expert academic classification based on support vector machine
The problem of expert academic personas is converted into text classification
First we automatically construct text training datasets based on seed expert database from Wikipedia
Then a unified model for Chinese-English expert classification is trained after text preprocessing and vectorization
Finally we verified the effectiveness of our method on the real dataset acquired from the Internet
Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the baseline methods and achieves a F1-measure of 83.5% for expert academic classification .
