Hermit crab shell exchange algorithm a new metaheuristic
The solution to numerous real-world problems is challenging using the in-hand deterministic approaches in the modern age
The researchers are continuously looking for new methods to deal with such tasks
The timE bound dependency on the solutions motivates the researchers to develop approximate approaches
If the answer is not with us nature may provide a direction for approximate solutions for various problems
A few applications have been significantly solved by algorithms inspired by the different species natural behavior
These naturE inspired algorithms are developed based on the survival strategies of the species
This study attempts to simulate the shelter searching strategy of the tropical cancer hermit crabs mathematically
The presented algorithm is called hermit crab shell exchange HCSE
The competitiveness of the HCSE algorithm is established on three different sets of optimization functions including various unconstrained constrained and engineering design optimization problems .
