A hybrid ant colony optimization algorithm to solve a transport problem with stochastic customer demands and electric vehicles of limited load capacity
The goal of this paper is to adapt a Hybrid Ant Colony Optimisation algorithm to solve a new mathematic model for the Capacited Electric Vehicle Routing Problem CEVRP with random customer demands being to be served from a depot by electric vehicles of known limited load capacity
The computational results are given for CEVRP benchmarks in the deterministic case and which shows that this adaptation is competitive with another method of the literature and that new best so far solutions have been obtained
The same benchmarks are used to show the viability of the proposed approach for the CEVRP with stochastic customer demands generated by a known probability distribution .
