Swarm optimization approaches for the minmax regret Fermat Weber problem with budgeted-constrained uncertain point weights
Given a set of existing points with their associated positive weights on the plane the classical Fermat Weber problem aims to find a new point that minimizes the overall weighted distances to the existing points
We investigate in this paper the Fermat Weber problem with budgeted-uncertain interval point weights
The minmax regret criterion is applied to identify the meaningful solution
We first study some structural properties of the problem
Then we develop an efficient algorithm to solve the corresponding problem where the swarm-oriented algorithms are applied as subroutines
Computational results show the benchmarking results for these proposed methods
An examination is presented on identifying the minmax regret Fermat Weber point concerning established a new airport in Vietnam alongside its application in product transfer scenarios .
