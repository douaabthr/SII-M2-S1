Construction of key parameter change model of human-computer interaction for intelligent decision-making under the condition of long time voyage
Under the long time voyage of the ship finding out the task time regularity of human operator in the command and control system can help the intelligent system to carry out the task intelligent assignment and planning in advance
In order to more accurately simulate the change rule of human-machine interaction of operators during the long time voyage this study develope a pointing interaction time model based on Fitts Law
This model provides accurate data about human cognitive modules for intelligent OODA loop
This study constructed the change function model of parameters a and b of Fitts Law in 95 days through experiments
By comparing the real data with the data obtained through the model simulation the average error of the simulation time is 5.87%
The function model can predict the operation time required for the operator to make a mouse click under the condition of long time voyage .
