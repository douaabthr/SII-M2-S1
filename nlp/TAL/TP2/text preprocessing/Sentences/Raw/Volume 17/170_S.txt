A heuristic node placement strategy for extending network lifetime and ensuring target coverage in mobile wireless sensor networks
Prolonging network lifetime has long been one of the most critical challenges in designing wireless sensor networks in general and mobile wireless sensor networks in particular
Regarding network lifetime one of the factors affecting it the most is energy efficiency
In a mobile wireless sensor network compared to stationary ones energy management has an even greater impact on the network lifetime since the movement of the sensors drains an enormous amount of energy
Moreover in target-based wireless sensor networks it is mandatory to ensure target coverage along with lifetime optimization
In this paper we investigate a mobile sensor network model where stationary targets must be continuously monitored by mobile sensors
In order to maximize network lifetime and guarantee the coverage of all targets in the monitoring region we take sensor nodes movement into account
We propose the Lifetime Effective Movement Algorithm a novel heuristic approach consisting of determining the optimal regions for sensor deployment and scheduling sensor nodes movement to address this issue
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms two existing approaches in terms of network lifetime with an improvement varying from 125% to 269%
Moreover the proposed method produces an approximation ratio in the range of 82.14 88.41% compared to the exact solution .
