Design and manufacture of an X-ray generator by support vector machines
One approach to the design experimentation parameter setting and assembly of an X-ray generator get performed to reduce radiation emission microgray mu Gy without neglecting the power of the beam emission KVp
A combination gets made in the manufacture of the transformer coil between turns of the secondary winding S_ k with the number of turns of the filament F_ i
As a result we obtained a transformer with an emissivity between the desired parameters and the optimum beam power
We classify feasible and infeasible cases in the assembly of X-ray devices using support vector machines
In addition the tools used for statistical inference were non-parametric tests such as the modified Friedman test and post-hoc Quade and Conover tests
Finally we obtained a good image with an excellent resolution without exposing people to high radiation emissions .
