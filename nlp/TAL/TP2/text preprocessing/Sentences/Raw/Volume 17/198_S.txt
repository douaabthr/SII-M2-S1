Rb-based link prediction based on the resource broadcast of nodes for complex networks
During the process of link prediction traditional resource allocation methods only consider the influence of common neighbor nodes as transmission paths while ignoring the impact of the effective resource amount of the topology structure surrounding these common neighbor nodes on link prediction performance
To address this limitation this paper proposes a complex network link prediction method based on resource broadcast
Firstly the paper provides a detailed analysis of the topology structure between the source node and the target node presenting four different transmission paths
Secondly in order to characterize the initial resources the paper defines the effective resource amount after transmission through these four paths as the resource broadcast amount between nodes
Lastly the similarity between nodes is characterized bidirectionally by considering the resource broadcast amount between nodes
Experiments conducted on 9 real network datasets demonstrate that when compared with 8 other similarity-based indicators this method achieves better prediction results according to benchmark evaluation indicators .
