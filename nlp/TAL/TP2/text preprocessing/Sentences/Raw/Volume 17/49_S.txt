Highly adaptive regression trees
The development of machine learning methods that are both accurate and interpretable is of paramount importance in healthcare and many other fields
The Highly Adaptive Lasso HAL has been shown to have predictive performance on par with state-of-the art algorithms
HAL involves performing regularized regression of the outcome on a tensor product of indicator basis functions
In this paper we show that this basis can be represented as a non-recursive partitioning of the feature space and propose a method for mapping this partitioning implied by HAL to a recursive partitioning
Such a mapping then allows for the representation of HAL as a decision tree thereby providing interpretability of predictions made by the algorithm
We refer to this post-hoc method for interpretability as Highly Adaptive Regression Trees HART
We provide a set of algorithms to construct this mapping and conveniently visualize the resulting tree
Using real data we show that HAL s predictive performance is on par with state-of-the-art methods and we demonstrate the construction and interpretation of HARTs .
