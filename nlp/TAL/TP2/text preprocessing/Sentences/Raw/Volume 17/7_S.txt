An option contract on emergency material reserve considering quality catastrophic change
This paper investigates an option contract for emergency material reserve because of quality catastrophic change
The quality catastrophic change happens randomly and the realized number can not be observed until it happened
Thus it is necessary to reserve some emergency material beforehand
However the demander is not qualified to make the storage
Meanwhile the supplier has no motivation to make storage for the demander
Thus an option contract is proposed to encourage the supplier to make backup for the demander and share the shortage cost if the backup less than the realized option order quantity
Three models are discussed the centralized model without option the decentralized model without option and the decentralized model with option
The results demonstrate that the order quantity for the first time under the centralized scenario is greater than that under the decentralized model without option
And the order of the purchase quantity for the first time under the three scenarios depend on the parameters decided by the both players
Meanwhile through analysing the effective range of option fee is proved to be limited to an interval .
