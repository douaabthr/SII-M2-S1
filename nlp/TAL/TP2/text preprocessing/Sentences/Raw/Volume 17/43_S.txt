Fuzzy differential equations conceptual interpretations
This paper aims to shed light on some of the conceptual interpretations that might be extracted from either the information conveyed by fuzzy differential equations FDEs or a fusion of such information with other data sources
Although no explicit effort has been conducted on the topic there are two significant imperatives for such interpretations
First conceptual interpretations are necessary when FDEs are employed in modelling prediction control theory and suchlike subjects
Simply put FDEs fail to be applicable if their corresponding interpretations have not been recognized conceptually
Second when FDEs are supposed to be analyzed
In other words in the lack of such interpretations of FDEs any analysis on this type of differential equations is conceptually devoid of meaning
The interpretations are associated with the concept of possibility distribution and differential equations which might be called imprecise differential equations IDEs that are in effect the mother of differential equations
The concept of IDE makes a convenient point of departure for the development of the interpretations in question in terms of the concepts such as machine-oriented meaning precisiation modal solutions precisiations compatibility and some new facets of sureness
Specifically interpretations associated with the compatibility of precisiations and the notion of human-machine-based sureness demonstrate the role played by information resident in an FDE fused with perception-based meaning precisiation that stems from the knowledge of an expert
Some illustrations and examples are presented to clarify the basic concepts and the applications of interpretations .
