Integrated VIKOR-TOPSIS strategy based on picture fuzzy knowledge and accuracy measures with application in waste-water treatment
In contrast to a fuzzy and intuitionistic fuzzy AInF set a picture fuzzy PIF set may be taken as an effective tool to tackle decision-making problems
Fuzzy and intuitionistic fuzzy set theory can be extended to PIF-set theory
In light of the insufficiency of existing information and knowledge measures this work proposes a knowledge measure for PIF-sets
The suggested knowledge measure efficacy and consistency are proven using numerical examples by comparing it to existing information andproper knowledge measures in the PIF-context
Aside from that the proposed knowledge measure is used to develop an accuracy measure for PIF-sets
In pattern identification problems the use of proposed accuracy measure is presented
Their effectiveness is demonstrated by using numerical examples
A modified version of the Vlse Kriterijumska Optimizacija Kompromisno Resenje VIKOR approach based on the proposed accuracy measure is presented with the goal to address a multi-criteria decision-making MCDM difficulty in a picture fuzzy context
Finally a case study on how to choose the most suitable method to treat wastewater is provided .
