Research on uncertain bi-objective UAV mission allocation problem
Based on the uncertainty theory this paper studies the uncertain bi-objective UAV mission allocation problem in uncertain environment
Firstly by regarding uncertainty factors in the mission allocation planning as uncertain variables and considering two missions of combat mission gains and flight fuel consumption a uncertain bi-objective UAV mission allocation UBUMA model is established
Secondly in order to overcome the disconnection between the objective functions caused by the traditional method to deal with uncertain factors this paper proposes a so-called uncertain method to solve UBMUA problem by defining the relationship of order between uncertain variables
According the real decision-making process the UBUMA is transformed into a single-objective programming problem by using C_E principle relation
Finally the ant algorithm is employed to solve the single-objective programming problem and then the C_E efficient mission routes are obtained
The simulation results show that this method can effectively deal with UBUMA problem and the mission allocation efficient routes is reasonable .
