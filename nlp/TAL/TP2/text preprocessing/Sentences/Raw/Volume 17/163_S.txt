Optimization for cost-effective design of water distribution networks a comprehensive learning approach
The Comprehensive Learning Gravitational Search Algorithm CLGSA has demonstrated its effectiveness in solving continuous optimization problems
In this research we extended the CLGSA to tackle NP-hard combinatorial problems and introduced the Discrete Comprehensive Learning Gravitational Search Algorithm D-CLGSA
The D-CLGSA framework incorporated a refined position and velocity update scheme tailored for discrete problems
To evaluate the algorithm s efficiency we conducted two sets of experiments
Firstly we assessed its performance on a diverse range of 24 benchmarks encompassing unimodal multimodal composite and special discrete functions
Secondly we applied the D-CLGSA to a practical optimization problem involving water distribution network planning and management
The D-CLGSA model was coupled with the hydraulic simulation solver EPANET to identify the optimal design for the water distribution network aiming for cost-effectiveness
We evaluated the model s performance on six distribution networks namely Two-loop network Hanoi network New-York City network GoYang network BakRyun network and Balerma network
The results of our study were promising surpassing previous studies in the field
Consequently the D-CLGSA model holds great potential as an optimizer for economically and reliably planning and managing water networks .
