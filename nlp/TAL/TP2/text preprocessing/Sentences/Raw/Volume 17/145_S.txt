Improved Harris Hawks Optimizer algorithm to solve the multi-depot open vehicle routing problem
The Multi-Depot Open Vehicle Routing Problem MDOVRP is only one example of several optimization problems that are classified as NP-hard
Therefore heuristic and metaheuristic approaches are helpful in obtaining a near-optimal solution
A hybrid HHO algorithm called HHO-PSO is proposed in this work to address the MDOVRP
The goal is to minimize costs for the routes of a fleet of vehicles that start moving from depots and fulfill customers demands
To improve the exploration of the Harris Hawks Optimization HHO algorithm the exploration method of Particle Swarm Optimization PSO which is more robust is used in this paper
Experimental results proved that the proposed hybrid algorithm works better than the original PSO and HHO in discrete space in terms of balance exploitation and exploration to solve the MDOVRP
Moreover the suggested algorithm is compared to five cutting-edge approaches on 24 MDOVRP instances with a broad number of customers
The computational findings reveal that the suggested approach outperformed the other comparable metaheuristic techniques in solving the MDOVRP .
