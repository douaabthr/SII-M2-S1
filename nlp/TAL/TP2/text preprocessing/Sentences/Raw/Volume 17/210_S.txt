ANNEGA an artificial neural network embedded genetic algorithm approach for energy efficient street lighting
A major impact on energy savings by efficient use of streetlights becomes significant to develop a smart city
There is a need to optimize the values of necessary street lighting parameters for energy planning
So an artificial neural network embedded genetic algorithm approach is proposed to obtain energy efficient street lighting
The neural network serves the purpose of the autonomous dimming of streetlights whenever required while the genetic algorithm is utilized to minimize the error anticipating in the training procedure of the artificial neural network model
In the proposed work each individual population of the genetic algorithm is comprised of four genes such as the number of hidden layers as well as the number of neurons on the first layer in the artificial neural network the activation function and the optimizer used for the training of the artificial neural network model
The outcome of the genetic algorithm generates the suitable values of the hyper-parameters in combinations which in turn determines the minimum training error for the artificial neural network model
The effectiveness of tuning hyper-parameters for selecting the best neural network architecture is comprehensively assessed
The computation time of the proposed work for different variations in terms of optimizers and activation functions is shown
Finally the proposed embedded framework has shown an improvement of 41.94% more energy efficiency and 94.8% less training error instead of existing works .
