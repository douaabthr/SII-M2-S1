A recurrent ANFIS tuned by modified differential evolution for efficient prediction of software reliability
Software failure prediction is a crucial task in software quality assurance
Although time series forecasting techniques and conventional software reliability models are used for the prediction of software reliability very often these models fail to provide accurate predictions
Therefore an accurate model for software reliability prediction is imperative
The objective of this paper is to introduce a hybrid model that merges a recurrent adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system RANFIS and modified differential evolution MDE for software reliability prediction
The model employs inner spatial feedback loops and delayed output feedback to improve the conventional neuro-fuzzy system s prediction abilities while dealing with time series software failure data
The hybrid model is trained by MDE where a new scheme of crossover and mutation has been proposed
We conduct an extensive simulation on a few publicly available benchmark datasets for computing the predicting ability of our hybrid model
Simulation results along with statistical analysis illustrate that our hybrid model predicts more precisely the time between successive failures in software and outperforms other traditional models .
