Combination of genetic algorithms and K-means for a hybrid topic modeling tourism use case
In recent years the proliferation of tourist experience sharing on social media platforms has led to the establishment of tourism forums as a prevalent medium for expressing opinions and discussing travel experiences globally
This emerging trend has motivated researchers to explore forum reviews considered as big data to extract valuable insights
Accurately identifying the topics within each review presents a significant challenge due to the heterogeneity and complexity of the data as well as the diverse range of subjects within the tourism domain and regional variations worldwide
The ability to accurately define review topics and create clusters of related topics holds considerable potential for informing decision-making processes for both tourists and tourism operators
This study presents a novel clustering architecture that combines genetic algorithms and K-means along with a hybrid topic discovery approach integrating latent Dirichlet allocation and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers
The proposed method aims to predict and analyze the most prominent topics within the context of touristic shopping destinations in Morocco .
