Cluster based active learning for classification of evolving streams
Classification of imbalanced unlabelled data streams with concept drift in evolving streams has posed many challenges recently
Learner performance from the minority class is poor at high imbalance degrees
This causes drift detection to fail
Therefore the existing model cannot be updated resulting in poor classifier performance
Detecting drifts is typically done through supervised learning
They are impractical despite their effectiveness in detecting drifts
In real-world applications only a portion of the data stream can be labelled as oracle assistance is pricey and laborious
To alleviate these problems a novel technique which is a cluster based active learning for class imbalance and concept drift CBAL is presented in the paper
Adaptive sampling strategies are used for solving high imbalance degrees
A two-layer drift detection strategy is used for detecting drifts where the first layer is unsupervised and the second layer is supervised
To reduce the labelling cost this framework uses a clustering technique for querying the labels
Extensive experiments over synthetic and real-world data streams exhibit better classification performance
CBAL detects the drifts with fewer false alarms and with lesser oracle intervention
For high imbalanced case i.e. 10% the performance of CBAL is 53% and higher whereas the performance of the other algorithms is zero or nil
The number of drifts detected by CBAL is much more accurate and it also reduces the labelling cost by 90% .
