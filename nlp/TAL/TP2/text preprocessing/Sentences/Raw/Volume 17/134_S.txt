FANS a framework for feature selection in sentiment classification using a modified Firefly algorithm
Sentiment classification is a prevalent task in text mining in which a text classifies into positive negative or neutral classes
Sentiment classification is an essential issue of decision-making for people companies etc
Feature selection is the most influential stage in sentiment classification
Due to the NP-hard nature of the problem and a huge of existing texts the traditional feature selection techniques such as statistical techniques generate sub-optimal solutions
Swarm intelligence algorithms are extensively devoted to optimization problems
These algorithms produce features by increasing the classification performance and decreasing the computational complexity and feature set size
In this study the authors proposed a framework using the modified multi-objective Firefly algorithm namely FANS Firefly Algorithm Naïve Bayes Sentiment
The two targets are decreasing the naïve Bayes error classifier and the k-nearest neighbor
A neural network is used as the final classifier
The three datasets on Movie review and Twitter domains are applied to evaluate the FANS
The FANS outperform its counterparts regarding precision accuracy and recall
The FANS yields 96.88% precision 97.65% accuracy and 96.54% recall .
