Unveiling the Many-Objective Dragonfly Algorithm s MaODA efficacy in complex optimization
In the field of multi-objective optimization algorithms MOAs a primary challenge is identifying an optimal solution that effectively converges to the true Pareto Front while maintaining a high level of diversity especially in the initial phases of evolution
To tackle this challenge this study introduces a novel algorithm named Many-Objective Dragonfly Algorithm MaODA
This method incorporates reference point niche preserve and information feedback mechanism for maintaining better balance between convergence and diversity
Through this study the MaODA effectiveness is established by using the WFG1-WFG9 test suite for 4 6 and 8 objectives and five real-world RWMaOP1 RWMaOP5 design problems
The findings demonstrate that MaODA outperforms its peer many-objective algorithms like MaOTLBO MaOJAYA MaOPSO and NSGA-III in most test scenarios in terms of GD IGD SP SD HV and RT metrices
It is shown that MaODA achieves better convergence as well as enhanced diversity and spread compared to peers .
