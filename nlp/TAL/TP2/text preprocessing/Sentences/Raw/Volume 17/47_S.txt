A chaotic adaptive butterfly optimization algorithm
Butterfly optimization algorithm is a population intelligent optimization algorithm which is easy to fall into local optimal and has low searching accuracy
In this paper a chaotic adaptive butterfly optimization algorithm CABOA is proposed
Firstly the Kent mapping is used to initialize the location of individual butterfly and increase the diversity of initial population
Secondly adaptive switch probability is introduced in search phases to balance local search and global search phase
Then the adaptive weight coefficient is introduced to adjust the search direction and the moving step of the individual butterfly to improve the convergence speed and accuracy of the algorithm
Finally Cauchy variation is carried out to guide the advance direction of the population and avoid falling into local optimum
In this paper the algorithm is used to obtain the optimal value of 12 benchmark test functions and is applied to the design of welded beams
Experimental results show that the performance of the improved algorithm has significant advantages over other comparison algorithms in the function optimization experiment the average optimal value is improved by 99% compared with the original algorithm and about 90% compared with other improved algorithms
Meanwhile the algorithm proposed in this paper obtains the optimal value of all functions and has high efficiency
Compared with other existing optimization algorithms CABOA has better convergence performance and certain competitiveness and has certain advantages in the application field .
