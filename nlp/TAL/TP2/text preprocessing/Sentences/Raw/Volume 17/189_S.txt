Extended water wave optimization EWWO technique a proposed approach for task scheduling in IoMT and healthcare applications
The Internet of Medical Things IoMT is a version of the Internet of Things
It is getting the attention of researchers because it can be used in a wide range of smart healthcare systems
One of the main advancements employed recently is the IoMT-cloud which allows users to access cloud services remotely over the internet
These cloud services require an efficient task scheduling approach that satisfies the Quality of Service parameters with a low energy consumption
This paper presents an overview of the integration of IoMT and cloud computing technologies
Besides this work proposes an efficient Extended Water Wave Optimization EWWO task scheduling in the IoMT Cloud for healthcare applications
EWWO algorithm performs based on its operations propagation refraction and breaking
The proposed EWWO scheduling technique minimizes the energy consumption makespan time execution time and increases the resource utilization
Cloudsim simulator is used to simulate the IoMT-Cloud environment to verify the effectiveness of EWWO technique
The performance has been evaluated based on various parameters such as energy consumption makespan time and execution time .
