Optimal feature subset selection for MRI brain tumor classification using improved ant-lion optimization
An accurate diagnosis of the type of brain tumor is crucial for experts to choose the best course of therapy and increase the patient s lifetime
The manual categorization of brain tumors in Magnetic resonance imaging MRI with similar structures or appearances can be complex and relies on expertise
Also brain MRI contains a significant number of redundant or irrelevant features and classification algorithms struggle to detect patterns without feature selection
By selecting prominent features the machine-learning model can produce a high level of predicted accuracy in medical diagnostic problems
In this paper an improved ant lion optimization approach IALO is developed to select the optimal features for wrapper-mode classification
Initially pre-processing is carried out to remove bias and noise
Tumor segmentation is performed using active contours driven by Laplacian of Gaussian energy and optimal region scalable fitting energy
From the segmented brain images hand-crafted features are extracted using the Histogram of Oriented Gradient Gray level co-occurrence matrix Gray level run length matrix and deep features are extracted using the ResNet50
The proposed IALO is employed for the selection of the best features from handcrafted and deep features
The final step was to classify brain tumors using Support Vector Machines Naive Bayes and Recurrent Neural Networks
The proposed IALO-based RNN exhibited enhanced accuracy of 99.59% for BRATS and 99.18% for J. Cheng brain images respectively
From the experimental results it is observed that our proposed model outperforms the existing metaheuristic optimization algorithms and effectively removes the least significant features while improving classification accuracy .
