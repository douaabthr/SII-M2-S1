Batch metaheuristic a migration-free framework for metaheuristic algorithms
Metaheuristics have emerged as one of the prominent problem-solving methodologies to handle optimization problems as they can provide good quality solutions within acceptable time limits
Numerous studies have been conducted in the field of metaheuristics proposing novel algorithms modifications in the existing ones etc to improve the performance of the metaheuristic framework
The multi-population or island approach is one such modification where solutions are divided into smaller subpopulations and migrate from one subpopulation to another to share information
Though useful this approach is often ignored due to additional parameters the burden of tuning them increased time complexity additional task of deciding migration policy migration ratio etc
In the present work we have proposed a novel framework to enhance the performance of existing population-based metaheuristic algorithms and named it Batch Metaheuristic
The present framework is easy to implement and understand has no migration of solutions among batches and is general in nature i. e can easily be incorporated with any population-based algorithm such as a Genetic Algorithm Particle Swarm Optimization Gravitational Search Algorithm and others
It divides the set of solutions in each iteration into several batches that are individually exposed to the algorithm chosen with different parameter values
We included the batch approach in two well-established population-based metaheuristics Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization
The approach is tested over fifteen benchmark functions five shifted benchmark functions and three classical engineering problems
The results obtained confirm the better performance of the batch approach over its non-batch counterparts
This approach incurs numerous associated benefits when put to use .
