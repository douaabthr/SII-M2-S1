Adaptive wideband sensing scheme based on Bayesian experimental design
In this paper we investigate the problem of wideband sensing for cognitive radio
Due to resource constraint a cognitive node targets at finding a given number of spectrum holes which is studied under a novel wideband sensing architecture
Specifically the cognitive node can dynamically focus its sensing measurements on different portions of contiguous channels
An adaptive wideband sensing scheme is proposed under the standard Bayesian experimental design framework via three steps 1 define a Bayesian cost that incorporates the numbers of desired spectrum holes 2 design hypothesis testing rule to detect access opportunities and 3 identify a scheme to adapt the measurements during the sensing process
In order to facilitate implementation we further propose an approximated Bayesian experiment design scheme to reduce the computational complexity
The performance gain of our wideband sensing scheme is demonstrated via numerical simulation .
