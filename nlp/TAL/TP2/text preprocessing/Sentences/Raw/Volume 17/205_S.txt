Hybrid meta-heuristic solving no-wait flow shop scheduling minimizing maximum tardiness
The non-waiting constraint is a crucial factor in industries with continuous production flows
Recognizing the significance of this constraint in the manufacturing process we propose several approaches to minimize the maximum tardiness in the no-wait manufacturing flow shop scheduling problem
This research presents two main approaches an exact method that utilizes mixed integer linear programming and an approximate method based on constructive heuristics and hybrid meta-heuristics
To tackle the problem we introduce multiple heuristics and hybrid improved meta-heuristics based Nawaz Enscore Ham greedy randomized adaptive search procedure and genetic algorithm
Furthermore we propose three hybrid meta-heuristics based on the simulated annealing approach
To validate the effectiveness and robustness of our methods we conducted experiments on multiple instances of the flow shop problem proposed by Taillard
The results demonstrate that the hybrid algorithm which combines a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure with the insertion procedure and simulated annealing exhibits strong performance
In fact this algorithm achieved a success rate of 72 across 200 test instances
It outperformed the other two meta-heuristics with a minimum average relative percentage deviation of only 0.0039 .
