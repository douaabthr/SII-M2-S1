An economic/emission dispatch based on a new multi-objective artificial bee colony optimization algorithm and NSGA-II
The conventional energy resources have limited reserves and their utilization is adversely affecting the environment
Hence it is necessary to generate electricity with the least cost and emission
The studies in the past reveal that the combined economic emission dispatch CEED problem has been solved by evolutionary and swarm intelligence-based optimization algorithms
However the methodology to identify the best compromising solution for the CEED problem has not been studied much in the literature
In this paper a multi-objective optimization algorithm which reduces fuel cost of power generation as well as emission simultaneously is presented
The algorithm is a combination of an artificial bee colony algorithm ABC and a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm NSGA-II with a new constraint handling feature
To validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm it is applied to three benchmark systems commonly used to study the effectiveness of optimization algorithms
Moreover the best compromising solution obtained by the proposed algorithm is identified by using sixteen multi-attribute decision-making MADM methods
The non-dominated solutions reported in the past literature for different test systems are also analysed using MADM methods
It has been shown that the proposed algorithm gives better results without violating the constraints and with the minimum number of iterations .
