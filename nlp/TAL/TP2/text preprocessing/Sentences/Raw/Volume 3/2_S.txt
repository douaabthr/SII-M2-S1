Collective neuro-evolution for evolving specialized sensor resolutions in a multi-rover task
This article presents results from an evaluation of the collective neuro-evolution CONE controller design method
CONE solves collective behavior tasks and increases task performance via facilitating emergent behavioral specialization
Emergent specialization is guided by genotype and behavioral specialization difference metrics that regulate genotype recombination
CONE is comparatively tested and evaluated with similar neuro-evolution methods in an extension of the multi-rover task where behavioral specialization is known to benefit task performance
The task is for multiple simulated autonomous vehicles rovers to maximize the detection of points of interest red rocks in a virtual environment
Results indicate that CONE is appropriate for deriving sets of specialized rover behaviors that complement each other such that a higher task performance comparative to related controller design methods is attained in the multi-rover task .
