GPU implementation of a road sign detector based on particle swarm optimization
Road Sign Detection is a major goal of the Advanced Driving Assistance Systems
Most published work on this problem share the same approach by which signs are first detected and then classified in video sequences even if different techniques are used
While detection is usually performed using classical computer vision techniques based on color and/or shape matching most often classification is performed by neural networks
In this work we present a novel modular and scalable approach to road sign detection based on Particle Swarm Optimization which takes into account both shape and color to detect signs
In our approach in particular the optimization of a single fitness function allows both to detect a sign belonging to a certain category and at the same time to estimate its position with respect to the camera reference frame
To speed up processing the algorithm implementation exploits the parallel computing capabilities offered by modern graphics cards and in particular by the Compute Unified Device Architecture by nVIDIA
The effectiveness of the approach has been assessed on both synthetic and real video sequences which have been successfully processed at or close to full frame rate .
