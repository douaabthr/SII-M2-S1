Recombination operators and selection strategies for evolutionary Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms
Markov Chain Monte Carlo MCMC methods are often used to sample from intractable target distributions
Some MCMC variants aim to improve the performance by running a population of MCMC chains
In this paper we investigate the use of techniques from Evolutionary Computation EC to design population-based MCMC algorithms that exchange useful information between the individual chains
We investigate how one can ensure that the resulting class of algorithms calledEvolutionary MCMC EMCMC samples from the target distribution as expected from any MCMC algorithm
We analytically and experimentally show using examples from discrete search spaces that the proposed EMCMCs can outperform standard MCMCs by exploiting common partial structures between the more likely individual states
The MCMC chains in the population interact through recombination and selection
We analyze the required properties of recombination operators and acceptance or selection rules in EMCMCs
An important issue is how to preserve the detailed balance property which is a sufficient condition for an irreducible and aperiodic EMCMC to converge to a given target distribution
Transferring EC techniques to population-based MCMCs should be done with care
For instance we prove that EMCMC algorithms with an elitist acceptance rule do not sample the target distribution correctly .
