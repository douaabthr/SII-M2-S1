A neighborhood search based cat swarm optimization algorithm for clustering problems
Clustering is an unsupervised technique that groups the similar data objects into a single subset using a distance function
It is also used to find the optimal set of clusters in a given dataset and each cluster consists of homogenous data objects
In present work an algorithm based on cat swarm optimization CSO is adopted for finding the optimal set of cluster centers for allocating the data objects
Further some improvements are also incorporated in CSO algorithm for improving clustering performance
These modifications are described as an improved solution search equation to improve convergence rate and an accelerated velocity equation for balancing exploration and exploitation processes of CSO algorithm
Moreover a neighborhood-based search strategy is introduced to handle local optima problem
The performance of proposed algorithm is tested on eight real-life datasets and compared with well-known clustering algorithms
The simulation results showed that proposed algorithm provides quality results in comparison to existing clustering algorithms .
