Application of improved time series Apriori algorithm by frequent itemsets in association rule data mining based on temporal constraint
The basic idea of Apriori algorithm is first introduced in this paper which is to find all frequent sets in a transaction
The frequent requirements of these frequent sets are greater than or equal to the minimum support of the set
On this basis the working principle of the traditional Apriori algorithm is analyzed and the existing problems are pointed out
To solve these problems an improved Apriori algorithm is proposed for time series of frequent itemsets
Finally on the basis of analyzing the methods and processes of mining association rules for time series this improved time series Apriori algorithm for frequent itemsets is applied to mining association rules based on time constraints
The experimental results show that the improved Apriori algorithm is better than the traditional one in storage space .
