Implementation of adaptive scheme in evolutionary technique for anomaly-based intrusion detection
Intrusion detection has become important to network security because of the increasing connectivity between computers and internet
Various Intrusion Detection Systems have been investigated to protect web or networks using several evolutionary methods and classification techniques
In this study we propose a new technique by combining Ensemble of Feature Selection EFS and Adaptive Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm AGOA methods called EFSAGOA which can help to identify the types of attack
In the proposed approach initially EFS method is applied to rank the attribute for selecting the high ranked subset of attributes
Then AGOA is employed to determine important attributes from the reduced datasets that can contribute to predict the networks traffic behavior
Furthermore adaptive behavior of GOA uses to decide whether a record represents an anomaly or not differing from some approaches acquainted in the literature
AGOA uses the Support Vector Machine SVM as a fitness function to choose the extremely efficient features and to maximize the classification performance
In addition it is also applied to optimize the penalty factor C kernel parameter sigma and tube size epsilon of SVM classifier
The performance of EFSAGOA has been evaluated on modern intrusion data as ISCX 2012
The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs better and obtain high detection rate accuracy and low false alarm rate compared to other state-of-art techniques in ISCX 2012 data .
