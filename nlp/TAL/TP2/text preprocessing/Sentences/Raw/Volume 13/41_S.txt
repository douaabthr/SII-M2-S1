Metaheuristic anopheles search algorithm
Today various optimization problems have been solved using different optimization techniques such as linear programming nonlinear programming and dynamic programming
These methods mainly try to find optimal solution in the proximity of starting point
Due to increase in complexity of optimization problems and number of optimal points efficiency of these methods in finding global optima has decreased
The mentioned challenges encouraged researchers to introduce novel methods inspired by natural phenomena
In this study Anopheles metaheuristic search algorithm which is inspired by transmission of Malaria disease by Anopheles mosquito is proposed
Our proposed method might be utilized in engineering optimization problems with continuous design variables
The algorithm explores search space using random search in order to eliminate unnecessary information
The efficiency of Anopheles optimization algorithm is evaluated using famous optimization problems
Also the performance of the proposed method is compared with other optimization methods .
