A polynomial time algorithm for big data in a special case of minimum constraint removal problem
The minimum constraint removal MCR is one of the most important problems in motion planning and computational geometry
In this problem there is no feasible path for a robot to move from the starting point towards the goal
Therefore in order to find a collision-free path the minimum constraints should be removed
TheMCRproblem is NP-hard when constraints have arbitrary shapes or are in shape of convex polygons
Since it is not possible to solve the problem by deterministic algorithms in an acceptable time for the problem with big data scientists have tried to solve it by approximation methods
In this paper we present a deterministic not approximation algorithm that solve the problem in a polynomial time
The simplification we used here is about the type of data neither about the accuracy of the solution nor about the size of data set
In this paper a special case of this problem is presented in which all the constraints are axis-aligned-unit squares and the obstacles have only local effects
Local effect means there are no two cells which have the same label sets
We propose an algorithm for this variant of the problem which can be used for big data
The proposed algorithm has O n 3 time complexity in the worst case .
