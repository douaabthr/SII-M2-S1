An evaluation of ear biometric system based on enhanced Jaya algorithm and SURF descriptors
Recently the ear biometric has received much attention for human recognition due to its unique shape and rich local features
However extracting discriminative features from ear images is a crucial task in presence of illumination changes low contrast noise and pose variations
With the aim of neutralizing the effect of these factors this paper proposes an automatic enhancement technique using meta-heuristic optimization to enhance the ear images
Here we modified a recent and simple yet meta-heuristic optimization technique known as Jaya algorithm by introducing a mutation operator to enhance the ear images in few iterations and the proposed approach is named as enhanced Jaya algorithm
Then we employed a pose-invariant local feature extractor SURF to extract local features
Finally thek-NNclassifier has used to evaluate the rate of correct identification
Extensive experiments are conducted on four standard datasets and the performance evaluation is carried out by qualitative and quantitative measures
Experimental results clearly indicate the proposed enhancement approach is competitive as compared to two classical methods HE CLAHE and two meta-heuristic algorithms PSO and DE-based image enhancement techniques .
