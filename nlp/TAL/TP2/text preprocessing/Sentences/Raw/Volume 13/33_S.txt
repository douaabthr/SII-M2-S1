Solving the twitter sentiment analysis problem based on a machine learning-based approach
Twitter Sentiment Analysis TSA as part of a text classification task has been widely attended by researchers in recent years
This paper presents a machine learning approach to solving the TSA problem in three phases
In the second phase a suitable value for representing each feature in the Vector Space Model is determined through the weighted combination of the values obtained from four methods i.e. Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency semantic similarity sentiment scoring using SentiWordNet and sentiment scoring based on the class of tweets
In this manner finding the percentage of contributions or weights of each method is defined as an optimization problem and solved using a genetic algorithm
Also the weighted values obtained from four methods are combined based on the Einstein sum as an important T-conorm method
Finally the performance of the proposed method is tested based on the accuracy of support vector machine and multinomial naïve Bayes classification algorithms on four famous Twitter datasets namely the Stanford testing dataset STS-Gold dataset Obama-McCain Debate dataset and Strict Obama-McCain Debate dataset
The obtained results show the high superiority of the proposed method in comparison with the other methods .
