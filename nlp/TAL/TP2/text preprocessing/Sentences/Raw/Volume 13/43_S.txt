Difficult first strategy GP an inexpensive sampling technique to improve the performance of genetic programming
Genetic programming GP is a top performer in solving classification and clustering problems in general and symbolic regression problems in particular
GP has produced impressive results and has outperformed human generated results for 76 different problems taken from 22 different fields
There remain a number of significant open issues despite its impressive results
Among them are high computational cost premature convergence and high error rate
These issues must be addressed for GP to realise its full potential
In this paper a simple and cost effective technique called Difficult First Strategy-GP DFS-GP is proposed to address the aforementioned problems
The proposed technique involves pre-processing and sampling steps
In the pre-processing step difficultto evolve data points by GP from the given data set are marked and in the sampling step they are introduced in the evolutionary run by using two newly defined sampling techniques called difficult points first and difficulty proportionate selection
These techniques are biased towards selecting difficult data points during the initial stage of a run and of easy points in the latter stage of a run
This ensures that GP does not ignore difficult-to-evolve data points during a run
Experiments have shown that GP coupled with DFS avoids premature convergence and attained higher fitness than standard GP using same fitness evaluations
Performance of the proposed technique was evaluated on three commonly known metrics which are convergence speed fitness and variance in the best results
Our results have shown that the proposed setups had achieved 10 15% better fitness values than Standard GP
Furthermore the proposed setups had consistently generated better quality solutions on all the problems and utilized 30 50% less computations to match the best performance of Standard GP .
