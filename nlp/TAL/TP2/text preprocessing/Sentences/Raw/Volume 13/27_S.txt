Performance evaluation of Botnet DDoS attack detection using machine learning
Botnet is regarded as one of the most sophisticated vulnerability threats nowadays
A large portion of network traffic is dominated by Botnets
Botnets are conglomeration of trade PCs Bots which are remotely controlled by their originator BotMaster under a Command and-Control C C foundation
They are the keys to several Internet assaults like spams Distributed Denial of Service Attacks DDoS rebate distortions malwares and phishing
To over the problem of DDoS attack various machine learning methods typically Support Vector Machine SVM Artificial Neural Network ANN Naïve Bayes NB Decision Tree DT and Unsupervised Learning USML K-means X-means etc . were proposed
With the increasing popularity of Machine Learning in the field of Computer Security it will be a remarkable accomplishment to carry out performance assessment of the machine learning methods given a common platform
This could assist developers in choosing a suitable method for their case studies and assist them in further research
This paper performed an experimental analysis of the machine learning methods for Botnet DDoS attack detection
The evaluation is done on the UNBS-NB 15 and KDD99 which are well-known publicity datasets for Botnet DDoS attack detection
Machine learning methods typically Support Vector Machine SVM Artificial Neural Network ANN Naïve Bayes NB Decision Tree DT and Unsupervised Learning USML are investigated for Accuracy False Alarm Rate FAR Sensitivity Specificity False positive rate FPR AUC and Matthews correlation coefficient MCC of datasets
Performance of KDD99 dataset has been experimentally shown to be better as compared to the UNBS-NB 15 dataset
This validation is significant in computer security and other related fields .
