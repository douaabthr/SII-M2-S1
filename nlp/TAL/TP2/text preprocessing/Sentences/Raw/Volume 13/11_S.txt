Performance evaluation of support vector machine and convolutional neural network algorithms in real-time vehicle type and color classification
In order for traffic management and information systems to provide proper traffic flow it is necessary to obtain information about traffic with the help of various sensors
In this context in recent years the use of video cameras in traffic observation and control has become very widespread and actively used
Numerous studies such as license plate recognition vehicle number finding traffic intensity determination vehicle speed calculation band violation and vehicle classification can be done with the help of video processing based video monitoring systems
Traffic surveillance videos are very actively used for this purpose
In this paper we have developed a system that classifies vehicles according to their type
Firstly we create a vehicle dataset from an uncalibrated camera
Then we test Tiny-YOLO real-time object detection and classification system and support vector machine SVM classifier model on our dataset and well-known public BIT-Vehicle dataset in terms of recall precision and intersection over union performance metrics
Experimental results show that two methods can be used to classify real-time streaming traffic video data .
