Mutation probability-based lion algorithm for design and optimization of microstrip patch antenna
The advantages and performance of microstrip patch antennas MPA namely reduced weight reduced profile and reduced cost formulate them the ideal choice for communication networks
However the difficulties in structure size and design remain a major concern
Hence this paper aims to propose a new model that derives a nonlinear objective model for helping in the design of solution space of antenna parameters
To attain this it is planned to incorporate the optimization concept thereby a new mutation probability based lion algorithm MP-LA which is proposed for the tuning MPA constraints
The main objective model of the antenna design is to maximize the gain by optimizing the patch length width thickness of substrate and value of dielectric substrate
After executing the simulation model this paper compares the performance of proposed MP-LA-based antenna design with numerous conventional approaches namely antenna design without optimization artificial bee colony-based AD genetic-based AD firefly-based AD part icle swarm optimization-based AD and grey wolf optimization-based AD proposed GWO-based AD and lion optimization algorithm-based AD
Moreover the analysis is done with respect to radiation pattern E-plane and H-plane of proposed and conventional antenna designs
Other performance analysis on characteristics impedance directivity efficiency and gain of proposed and conventional models is done .
