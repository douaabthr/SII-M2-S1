Adapted a novel similarity and its application in fuzzy risk analysis
Generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers GTFNs and their similarity measures have been widely applied in fuzzy risk analysis
However some existing similarity measures of GTFNs cannot identify the similarity of some special GTFNs properly
In this study we introduce the exponential distance of center of gravity COG and an amending value to adapted a novel similarity measure between GTFNs
Then seven properties of this new method are investigated and proved
In addition in order to verify the superiority of the new method fifteen special testing sets are given to compare the performance of seven existing similarity measures with the new method
Moreover the presented new similarity measure is used to solve a case study about the failure risk analysis of six major subsystems of the reciprocating pump system RPS in which different parameters are expressed by generalized trapezoidal fuzzy linguistic term .
