Improving many objective optimisation algorithms using objective dimensionality reduction
Many-objective optimisation problems MaOPs have recently received a considerable attention from researchers
Due to the large number of objectives MaOPs bring serious difficulties to existing multi-objective evolutionary algorithms MOEAs
The major difficulties includes the poor scalability the high computational cost and the difficulty in visualisation
A number of many-objective evolutionary algorithms MaOEAs has been proposed to tackle MaOPs but existing MaOEAs have still faced with the difficulties when the number of objectives increases
Real-world MaOPs often have redundant objectives that are not only inessential to describe the Pareto-optimal front but also deteriorate MaOEAs
A common approach to the problem is to use objective dimensionality reduction algorithms to eliminate redundant objectives
By removing redundant objectives objective reduction algorithms can improve the search efficiency reduce computational cost and support for decision making
The performance of an objective dimensionality reduction strongly depends on nondominated solutions generated by MOEAs/MaOEAs
The impact of objective reduction algorithms on MOEAs and vice versa have been widely investigated
However the impact of objective reduction algorithms on MaOEAs and vice versa have been rarely investigated
This paper studies the interdependence of objective reduction algorithms on MaOEAs
Experimental results show that combining an objective reduction algorithm with an MOEA can only successfully remove redundant objectives when the total number of objectives is small
In contrast combining the objective reduction algorithm with an MaOEA can successfully remove redundant objectives even when the total number of objectives is large
Experimental results also show that objective reduction algorithms can significantly improve the performance of MaOEAs .
