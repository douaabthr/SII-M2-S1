An enhanced Moth-flame optimization algorithm for permutation-based problems
Moth-flame optimizer MFO is one of the recently proposed metaheuristic optimization techniques which has been successfully used in wide range of applications
However there are two issues with the MFO algorithm
First as a stochastic technique MFO may prematurely converge at some local minima during the search process
Second the original MFO was developed for continuous search space problems and is not directly applicable to e.g. permutation-based problems PBP
In this paper a novel perturbation strategy is introduced to the MFO algorithm to avoid probable local minima regions
This strategy works as follows if the best solution obtained so far doesn t improve for a given number of consecutive iterations the current population of solutions is perturbed using some crossover mechanism as an attempt to explore new promising neighbourhoods in the search space
In addition smallest position values mapping technique is employed in order for the proposed termed CrossMFO COMFO algorithm to be applicable to PBP problems
It is noticed that despite these modifications the proposed COMFO has the same time complexity order as the original MFO
Extensive simulation experiments are conducted to compare the proposed COMFO to the MFO other enhanced versions of MFO and some metaheuristic optimizers in solving the well-known Travelling Salesman Problem TSP
Empirical results show that the solutions obtained using MFO are improved by a factor of 24 47% on average for large TSP instances having more than 100 cities using COMFO and can even reach 38 58% using different settings
In addition compared to other algorithms in the literature the proposed algorithm provides on average better solutions
Hence it can be considered a promising and efficient technique for this type of problems .
