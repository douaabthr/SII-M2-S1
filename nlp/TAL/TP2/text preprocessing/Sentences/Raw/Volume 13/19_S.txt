Hybrid genetic algorithm and a fuzzy logic classifier for heart disease diagnosis
For the past two decades most of the people from developing countries are suffering from heart disease
Diagnosing these diseases at earlier stages helps patients reduce the risk of death and also in reducing the cost of treatment
The objective of adaptive genetic algorithm with fuzzy logic AGAFL model is to predict heart disease which will help medical practitioners in diagnosing heart disease at early stages
The model consists of the rough sets based heart disease feature selection module and the fuzzy rule based classification module
The generated rules from fuzzy classifiers are optimized by applying the adaptive genetic algorithm
First important features which effect heart disease are selected by rough set theory
The second step predicts the heart disease using the hybrid AGAFL classifier
The experimentation is performed on the publicly available UCI heart disease datasets
Thorough experimental analysis shows that our approach has outperformed current existing methods .
