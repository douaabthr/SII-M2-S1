Evolutionary linkage creation between information sources in P2P networks
The present paper proposes a peer-to-peer P2P information retrieval and sharing system that evolutionarily creates linkages of information sources that are useful for both information publishers and information users where information is managed in a decentralized manner
The proposed system relies on interactions among information publishers who actually generate information and have the greatest knowledge of the information information users who use the information and a network that creates useful linkages of information sources information publishers
In order to enhance the value of their own information sources information publishers propose new linkages of information sources that indicate information sources with which they would like to have their own information sources co-occur
The information users evaluate the linkages proposed by the information publishers
The network evolutionarily reconstructs the topological structures of the P2P network based on the fitness obtained from the users
Simulation results suggest that it is possible to find more information sources that users desire using the topological structures reconstructed by the proposed system as compared to the use of non-reconstructed topological structures .
