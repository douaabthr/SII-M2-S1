Shapiro Evolution a view from the twenty-first century
Most readers of and contributers to this journal are likely to interpret evolutionary intelligence as the use of population based search techniques with random mutations and selection to generate intelligent behavior
In contrast the bottom line of Shapiro s book is biological evolution itselfISan intelligent cognitive sentient thoughtful are the words he uses process
In the words of the first paragraph life requires cognition at all levels and in the concluding paragraphs 21st view of evolution implies a shift from thinking about gradual selection of localized random changes to sudden genome structuring by sensory network-influenced cell systems
It replaces the invisible hands of geological time and natural selection with cognitive networks and cellular functions of self modification
The emphasizes is systemic rather than atomistic and information based rather than stochastic .
