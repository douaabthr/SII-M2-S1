Meta-heuristic approach to proportional fairness
Proportional fairness is a concept from resource sharing tasks amongnusers where each user receives at least 1 nof her or his total value of the infinitely divisible resource
Here we provide an approach to proportional fairness that allows its extension to discrete domains as well as for the direct application of evolutionary computation to approximate proportional fair states
We employ the concept of relational optimization where the optimization task becomes the finding of extreme elements of a binary relation and define a proportional fairness relation correspondingly
By using a rank-ordered version of proportional fairness the so-called ordered proportional fairness we can improve the active finding of maximal proportional fair elements by evolutionary meta-heuristic algorithms
This is demonstrated by using modified versions of the strength pareto evolutionary algorithm version 2 SPEA2 and multi-objective particle swarm optimization
In comparison between proportional and ordered proportional fairness and by using relational SPEA2 the evolved maximum sets of ordered proportional fairness achieve 10 more dominance cases against a set of random vectors than proportional fairness .
