Advanced CEEMD hybrid model for VIX forecasting optimized decision trees and ARIMA integration
This study focuses on the time series analysis and forecasting of the Volatility Index VIX data in the United States
We employed the Complete Empirical Mode Decomposition CEEMD method to decompose the original VIX data into seven Intrinsic Mode Functions IMFs
Subsequently each IMF determined its stationarity using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller ADF test
For stationary IMFs an AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average ARIMA model was built while non-stationary IMFs were fitted using machine learning regression algorithms
The sum of the predicted values of all IMFs was considered as the forecast VIX value
About the parameter selection in machine learning algorithms we employed the Optuna library to optimize the model s parameters
We selected the parameters that resulted in the lowest Mean Squared Error MSE on a validation set to be the optimal model parameters
Applying this methodology we found that our hybrid model has greater predictive capabilities compared to simple machine learning models when the market fluctuates greatly
Specifically the AdaBoost model outperformed a basic decision tree model and a random forest model in terms of MSE and MAE mean absolute error accuracy .
