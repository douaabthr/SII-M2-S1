An efficient model using deep convolutional neural networks for modeling underwater images
Underwater photography suffers from the dispersion of light in water
Blurring and color distortion of an image are difficult aspects of underwater image analysis
Various methods have been investigated for providing solutions for underwater image restoration
Nevertheless these approaches still exhibit a regression
Herein we describe a deep convolutional neural network DCNetUI for medium transmission estimation
DCNetUI adopts Deep Convolutional Neural Networks DCNN whose layers are specially designed to embody the established assumptions/priors in image restoration
Specifically layers of Maxout units are used to extract almost all haze-relevant features
Parallel convolution with multi scale features are used to remove haze
Max-polling layer is able to preserve resolution of the feature maps
We also propose a novel nonlinear activation function Bilateral Rectified Linear Unit BReLU which alleviate the noisy problem
To refine the transmission map gradient filter is used to smooth the image
Finally the performances of the proposed and existing methods were verified by comparing the experimental results with those of known methods under quality metric settings
Experiments on benchmark images show that DCNetUI achieves superior performance over existing methods yet keeps efficient and easy to use . The recommended method enhances the color of an image by removing the influence of the aquatic elements
It increased the SSIM by 29% with a value of 0.967 and PSNR of 47% with a maximum value of 54.537 .
