Smadasyn-boosted cross-project transfer learning for effective security fault prediction
Purpose Security-related software fault prediction is essential yet challenging due to limited labeled vulnerability data and the inconsistency of fault patterns across software projects
This study aims to improve the generalizability of fault prediction models using a cross-project learning approach
Method We propose a cross-project transfer learning framework for security fault prediction enhanced by feature distribution alignment techniques including Kolmogorov Smirnov KS test Anderson Darling test and Pearson correlation
To effectively address the issue of class imbalance prevalent in vulnerability datasets we introduce SMADASYN a hybrid oversampling method that integrates the strengths of SMOTE Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique and ADASYN Adaptive Synthetic Sampling
The proposed approach is empirically validated across six Apache software projects using a range of classifiers Decision Tree Naive Bayes Logistic Regression and Random Forest along with ensemble methods such as Bagging Boosting and Stacking
Results Experimental results demonstrate that Random Forest consistently achieves the highest performance particularly in terms of F1-score and recall
Statistical validation using the Friedman test and Nemenyi post-hoc analysis confirms the significance and robustness of the results across datasets
Conclusion The proposed method effectively enhances security fault prediction in cross-project scenarios
By combining feature alignment and advanced sampling techniques the framework delivers accurate and generalizable predictions offering practical value for software security assurance .
