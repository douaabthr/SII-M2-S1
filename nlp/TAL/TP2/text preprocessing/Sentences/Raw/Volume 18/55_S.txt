Global optimization through PROMETHEE-driven tri-point selection based genetic algorithms
To address the limitations of conventional selection techniques like roulette wheel selection and stochastic universal sampling SUS this study introduces the tri-point selection TPS operator an innovative enhancement for genetic algorithms GAs
Using CEC 2017 benchmark functions across different dimensions
The proposed selection scheme TPS achieves optimum mean values 35% outperforming RW 15% TS 24% and SUS 25%
While the average standard deviation of TPS 39% is higher compared to RW 26% SUS 20% and TS 15% TPS demonstrates superior consistency by achieving the least standard deviations in 33 out of 84 cases
This balance between exploration and stability enables TPS to deliver a higher percentage of ideal results showing its robustness across diverse optimization scenarios
PROMETHEE analysis further confirms TPS s effectiveness in maintaining an optimal balance between exploration and exploitation leading to improved convergence performance
This advancement not only refines GA selection processes but also opens new avenues for TPS s application in solving complex optimization challenges .
