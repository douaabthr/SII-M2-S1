DEL a strategy for resolving redundancy in entity pairs within dual entity linker for relational triple extraction
Currently the mainstream methods for relational triple extraction mainly employ joint models and have achieved significant results
However these methods still face challenges in dealing with the complexity of unstructured text
In joint models based on labeled relational triple extraction the BiRTE model suffers from the issue of redundant entity pairs leading to the generation of incorrect triples
To address this issue This paper introduces a Ground Entity Extractor which is designed to aid the Dual Entity Linker DEL in addition adversarial training methods are introduced during the DEL training process
Experimental results demonstrate that the DEL model extracts entity pairs from two directions when compared to the previous BIRTE model it generates more accurate entity pairs
On the WebNLG dataset The accuracy increased by 2.9% and F1 improved by 1.1%
On the NYT10 dataset accuracy increased by 1.0% recall increased by 0.5% and F1 score improved by 0.7%
This brings significant enhancements to the triple entity extraction task and in comparison with 8 baseline models across all datasets the DEL model achieves better results .
