Document clustering with evolved multi-word search queries
Text clustering holds significant value across various domains due to its ability to identify patterns and group related information
Current approaches which rely heavily on a computed similarity measure between documents are often limited in accuracy and interpretability
We present a novel approach to the problem based on a set of evolved search queries
Clusters are formed as the set of documents matched by a single search query in the set of queries
The queries are optimized to maximize the number of documents returned and to minimize the overlap between clusters documents returned by more than one query
Where queries contain more than one word they are interpreted disjunctively
We have found it useful to assign one word to be the root and constrain the query construction such that the set of documents returned by any additional query words intersect with the set returned by the root word
Not all documents in a collection are returned by any of the search queries in a set so once the search query evolution is completed a second stage is performed whereby a KNN algorithm is applied to assign all unassigned documents to their nearest cluster
We describe the method and present results using 8 text datasets comparing effectiveness with well-known existing algorithms
We note that as well as achieving the highest accuracy on these datasets the search query format provides the qualitative benefits of being interpretable and modifiable whilst providing a causal explanation of cluster construction .
