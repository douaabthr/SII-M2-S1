Beyond publication numbers a novel approach to academic ranking using evolutionary programming
Evaluating the impact of researchers within a scientific community remains a complex and debated issue
Traditional metrics such as publication and citation counts often fail to capture the multifaceted nature of scholarly influence
While several indices such as the h-index and its variants have been proposed they too face limitations in reflecting qualitative and longitudinal aspects of academic contributions
This study introduces a novel researcher ranking framework that integrates four distinct parameters Normalized Citation Score NCS Complete Career Contribution CCC Temporal Citation Input TCI and Collaborative Prestige CP
These parameters are combined using two ranking mechanisms the Statistical Ranking System SRS based on mathematical models and the Comprehensive Ranking System CRS which employs Genetic Programming GP to evolve domain-specific ranking formulas
The methodology was evaluated across five datasets Computer Science Mathematics Neuroscience Civil Engineering and a combined dataset each balanced with equal numbers of awardees and non-awardees
In SRS models such as the Lehmer Mean and Logarithmic Mean performed effectively in highlighting awardees
In CRS the evolved models achieved fitness values of up to 0.96 in Computer Science and 0.88 in Mathematics with slightly lower scores in other domains
The reduced performance on the combined dataset highlights the importance of domain-sensitive modeling
The results suggest that the proposed framework offers a flexible and comprehensive approach to researcher evaluation that can adapt to domain-specific impact patterns providing an alternative to conventional ranking metrics .
