MCDFN supply chain demand forecasting via an explainable multi-channel data fusion network model
Accurate demand forecasting is vital for optimizing supply chain management and enhancing organizational resilience
Traditional forecasting methods relying on simple arithmetic often fail to capture complex patterns caused by seasonal variability and special events
Although deep learning techniques have advanced the lack of interpretable models hampers understanding and explaining predictions
We introduce the Multi-Channel Data Fusion Network MCDFN a novel hybrid deep learning architecture integrating multiple data modalities for superior demand forecasting
MCDFN utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks CNNs Long Short-Term Memory networks LSTMs and Gated Recurrent Units GRUs to extract spatial and temporal features from time series data
Comparative benchmarking against seven other deep-learning models validates MCDFN s efficacy showing it outperforms its counterparts across key metrics with a mean squared error MSE of 23.5738 root mean squared error RMSE of 4.8553 mean absolute error MAE of 3.9991 and mean absolute percentage error MAPE of 20.1575%
Theil s U statistic of 0.1181 U 1 of MCDFN indicates its superiority over the naive forecasting approach and a 10 fold cross-validated statistical pairedt-test with ap-value of 5% indicated no significant difference between MCDFN s predictions and actual values
To address the black box nature of MCDFN we employ explainable AI techniques such as ShapTime and Permutation Feature Importance offering insights into model decision-making processes
This research advances demand forecasting methodologies and provides practical guidelines for integrating MCDFN into existing supply chain systems .
