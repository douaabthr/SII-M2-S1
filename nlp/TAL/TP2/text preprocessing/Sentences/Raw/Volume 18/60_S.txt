Solving the capacitated facility location problem with service distance and outsourcing using a customized artificial bee colony algorithm
This article considers a variant of the capacitated facility location problem where each customer has a non-negative demand and each facility has a non-negative capacity limit and a service distance beyond which it cannot serve customers
A fixed number of facilities are opened from potential locations
The open facilities can only provide service to the customers incurring service costs
Due to the capacity limits and service distance of facilities all the customers may not be serviced by the open facilities and these customers can be outsourced incurring outsourcing costs
Each customer has its own non-negative outsourcing cost
The goal is to minimize the sum of service and outsourcing costs
This problem is termed the Capacitated Facility Location Problem with Service Distance and Outsourcing CFLPSDO
A 0-1 integer linear programming formulation for CFLPSDO is presented in this article
For experimentation 45 instances are generated from real-world maximal covering location problem instances
These are solved using the exact solver CPLEX to create benchmark solutions
Then a customized Artificial Bee Colony ABC algorithm-based metaheuristic with two operators for enhanced search space exploration and exploitation is employed and found to produce optimal solutions efficiently .
