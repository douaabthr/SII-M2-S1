Robot path planning method in rough terrain based on multi-objective crossover-mutation particle swarm optimization
Automatic path planning in complex three-dimensional environments is a key problem for robots when performing tasks effectively
However existing path planning methods especially the traditional particle swarm optimization PSO face key challenges when dealing with such problems such as easily falling into local optimal solutions lack of diversity and insufficient precision
These problems limit the performance and reliability of path-planning algorithms in complex environments
To overcome these limitations this paper proposes a new hybrid path planning algorithm by introducing a state factor-based inertia weight updating scheme and merging the crossover-mutation operator into the multi-objective particle swarm optimization MOPSO which is called MOSFCMPSO
Firstly by setting adaptive tuning parameters in MOPSO the probability of particles falling into the local optimal solution is reduced
Secondly crossover and mutation operators are added to increase the diversity of the population to avoid the early precocious phenomenon
Finally to evaluate the performance of the proposed MOSFCMPSO comparisons are conducted with several other algorithms standard MOPSO linearly decreasing inertia weight MOPSO LMOPSO MOPSO based on state factor-based inertia weight updating scheme MOSFPSO multi-objective grey wolf optimizer MOGWO non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II NSGA-II and K-means clustering based MOPSO K-MOPSO across three terrains of varying complexity
The simulation results demonstrate that MOSFCMPSO outperforms all other algorithms regarding search accuracy population diversity and optimization results
Specifically when compared to the most competitive state-of-the-art algorithm the proposed method achieves a reduction in path length of 3.64 2.26 and 5.76 and a decrease in terrain roughness of 7.98 4.19 and 4.44 in simple moderately complex and highly complex terrains respectively .
