An intellectual model of pest detection and classification using enhanced optimization-assisted single shot detector and graph attention network
Identifying pests in the plants is considered to be an efficient accurate and sustainable way to improve the food quality and economic values in the agricultural industry
It equips farmers with cutting-edge instruments to safeguard their harvests lessen their effect on the environment and satisfy the growing need for sustenance on a worldwide scale
Deep learning can completely transform the identification of pests as it develops protecting agriculture s production and resistance against ever-changing insect threats
It can be difficult to combine multiple methods for pest identification including artificial intelligence satellite imaging and detectors
It is difficult to make sure that such innovations are available to farms and function well together
It s common for farmers as well as other agricultural personnel to require certification to properly utilize pest detection equipment and understand the findings
For these innovations to be widely adopted the gap in understanding must be closed
Addressing these challenges requires an effective novel deep learning-based pest detection method
In this paper a deep learning-based pest detection and classification model is developed to identify diseases caused by pests at an early stage
Initially the images are collected from online datasets
Collected images underwent detection using the Adaptive Single Shot Detector ASSD
To enhance the accuracy and efficiency of ASSD the model parameters are fine-tuned by utilizing the Enhanced Running City Game Optimizer
This optimization process aims to improve the precision of pest detection
The classification of pests is done using the proposed Multi-scale and Dilated Graph Attention Network
This innovative network architecture is designed to categorize the pests effectively
The outcome of the proposed model is justified by comparing it with other classifiers and algorithms .
