An enhanced sparse subset selection model based on adaptive projection distance
Subset selection focuses on identifying representative samples from a large dataset to produce a data subset that can represent the main features of the original data and also reduce the data size in an effective way
Sparse representation theory puts emphasis on enhancing the data sparsity while subset selection aims to reduce the data size
Sparse subset selection is an important branch of subset selection that incorporates sparse representation theory into the exploration of subset selection
Sparse modeling representative selection model has demonstrated outstanding performance in data classification and video summarization
Nonetheless it suffers from the issue of poor typicality of the selected representatives
Although some recent works have addressed this problem to some extent by introducing the concept of clustering coding terms most of the clustering coding terms constructed by these existing methods are implicit and the model structure is complicated inefficient and difficult to be understood
To overcome these difficulties we propose an adaptive projection distance-based sparse subset selection model
This model constructs a clustering coding item by adaptively calculating the projection distance between data
It can not only eliminate redundant and noisy features in the original data but also ensure that the selected representatives are more typical
To solve the proposed model an efficient algorithm is developed by virtue of the alternating direction method of multipliers
Extensive experiments with comparative analysis demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms several state-of-the-art models in various tasks including subset selection cluster analysis classification and face image representative selection .
