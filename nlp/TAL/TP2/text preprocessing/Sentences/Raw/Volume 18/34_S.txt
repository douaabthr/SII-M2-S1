Synergistic optimization of predictive models for water quality analysis in treatment plants using machine learning and evolutionary algorithms
Enhancing the assessment of water quality is essential for sustainable water management given its critical impact on environmental health and human well-being
Accurate assessment presents several difficulties due to the complexity and variability of water ecosystems
Among the various machine learning techniques employed Support Vector Regression and Adaptive Boosting have emerged as two of the most widely used and effective methods
In recent years many evolutionary algorithms have been developed to find approximate solutions to optimization problems
In this study we investigate how efficient new algorithms consisting of hybrids of machine learning methods and evolutionary algorithms can be for some problems
We extensively investigate Support Vector Regression with various kernels including linear radial basis function polynomial and sigmoid
In addition we introduce Modified Support Vector Regression and Modified Adaboost where standalone ML models are combined with the swarm-based algorithms such as Particle Swarm Optimization Limited-memory Broyden Fletcher Goldfarb Shanno and Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python
We apply the proposed hybrid algorithms to the problem of measuring water quality
Accurate modeling and assessment of river water quality are essential endeavors with multifaceted challenges
We focus on the Tigris River modeling in Baghdad Governorate particularly at three water treatment plants Eastern Tigris AL-Karkh and AL-Wathba
The dataset comprises multiple water quality parameters with a total dissolved solids target
Incorporating swarm-based algorithms into the adopted models has synergistically enhanced their predictive capabilities resulting in a significant augmentation of the overall predictive prowess of the ML models
The proposed hybrid algorithms successfully enhanced SVR model performance with the L-BFGS-B algorithm yielding mean squared error reductions of 46.23% and 28.09% on the East Tigris and Karkh plants respectively
In comparison the MSVR-PSO approach reduced the Wathba plant by up to 85.96%
These findings have a significant impact on advancing water treatment plants
A thorough understanding of these variations is required when deciding on the optimal machine learning model for individual applications and generalization for Tigris River water quality scale evaluation and beyond .
