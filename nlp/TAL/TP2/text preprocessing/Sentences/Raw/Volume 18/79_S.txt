A comprehensive review of optimization market strategies and AI applications in energy storage systems
The increasing integration of energy storage is transforming the operations of today s electricity markets
This review analyses the problems linked to the variability of renewable energy sources and the integration of distributed energy resources into existing power systems
It underlines the market model gap which is able to deal with the operational problems that such variability creates
Additionally this review shows that optimizing the utilization and management of energy storage systems leads to improved grid reliability system economy and economic resilience
A comprehensive study is performed for both conventional and deregulated markets capturing the details of the relevant policy context and other modeling elements including optimization methods stochastic modeling game theory and artificial intelligence
Relevant Australian and Japanese real-world case studies have been analysed to demonstrate the practical application of these systems and their market activities and storage optimization strategies
This review also identifies important technological drivers analyses new technologies and assesses the environmental and social impacts of large-scale energy storage systems
All of these works are accompanied by conclusions meant to outline the gaps that future works should target .
