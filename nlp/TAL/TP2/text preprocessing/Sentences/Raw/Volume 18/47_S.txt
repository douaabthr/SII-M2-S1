Neural network-driven scenario prediction for adaptive routing in MANETs using expanding ring search and random early detection
Routing in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks MANETs is complex due to their decentralized topology and dynamic environments
Conventional routing protocols frequently have trouble maintaining reliable end-to-end communication leading to issues such as high packet loss unstable routes and increased delays
The research presented a novel deep-learning model with hybrid optimization to maintain route stability through stable node prediction and optimal route discovery in a MANET environment
Here Dynamic Sparse Recurrent-Convolutional Neural Network DSR-CNN an advanced variant of the R-CNN family is employed to detect the stable node in a sparse and dynamic environment
The weight parameters of the DSR-CNN are optimized by the Enhanced Fick s Law Optimization Algorithm for the improved node prediction maintaining reliability and connectivity
Moreover the most stable routes are constructed through the Giant Trevally Optimizer optimizing route exploration and recovery
The model is designed and simulated in a Python environment with the required network settings
The utilization of the proposed research in the MANET communication shows 98% prediction accuracy 2.48 ms delay 25Mbps throughput and 99% of packet delivery ratio which are more efficient than the prevailing technique s results showing the highest route stability
These findings highlight the potential of DSR-CNN to significantly improve the reliability and performance of MANETs setting a new benchmark for future routing protocols .
