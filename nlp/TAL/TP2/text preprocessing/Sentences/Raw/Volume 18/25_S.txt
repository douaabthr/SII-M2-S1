Reliability-based multi-objective optimization of trusses with greylag goose algorithm
This paper introduces a multi-objective variant of the Greylag Goose Optimizer MOGGO to tackle complex structural optimization problems
Inspired by the cooperative behavior of geese in flight MOGGO employs dynamic grouping to enhance problem-solving efficiency
Six truss structures undergo simultaneous topology shape and size optimization using MOGGO aiming to maximize reliability while minimizing structural mass
By incorporating non-dominance sorting and archiving techniques MOGGO extends the single-objective Greylag Goose Optimizer to effectively address trade-offs between competing objectives
Evaluation metrics and statistical tests demonstrate MOGGO s superior performance in handling large structural optimization problems preserving more Pareto-optimal sets and achieving greater convergence and variance in objective and decision spaces
MOGGO s ability to manage conflicting objectives is further validated through diversity analysis with swarm plots illustrating its superior convergence behavior across iterations
Overall MOGGO proves to be an efficient and effective approach for addressing challenging reliability-based multi-objective structural optimization problems .
