appli cuckoo search base algorithm and hybrid base neural classifi for breast cancer detect use ultrasound imag
ultrasound examin is one of the most conveni and appropri process use for the diagnosi of tumor that make use of ultrasound imag
ultrasound imag is a noninvas modal util commonli for the detect of breast cancer which is a common and danger cancer found in women
thi paper propos an approach for the detect of breast cancer use ultrasound imag use mkf-cuckoo search mkf-c algorithm and hybrid base neural h-bn classifi
in pre-process the input imag to be diagnos are pre-process by roi extract use a novel algorithm four way search
the pre-process imag is allow to perform segment use mkf-c algorithm
the key featur such as mean varianc standard deviat and so on are extract in featur extract and are fed to the propos h-bn classifi
base on the train data h-bn classifi classifi the data into benign or malign tumor class for the detect of breast cancer
to evalu the perform of the propos mkfcs-hbn approach three metric such as accuraci sensit and specif are util
the experiment result show that mkfcs-hbn could attain the maximum perform with an accuraci of 0.8889 the sensit of 1 and specif of 0.85 and thu prove it effect .
