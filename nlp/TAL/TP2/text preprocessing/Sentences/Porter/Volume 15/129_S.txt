minimum landmark for robot local in orthogon environ
robot local is one of the most fundament problem in motion plane with mani import applic in track vehicl and router system
one way for local the robot is trilater which is use in the environ without gp antenna by use a number of signal that can be measur their distanc to robot at ani time
it ha alreadi been shown that lfloor frac 8n 9 rfloor landmark are suffici for trilater a simpl n-side
later as a better result it ha been prove that lfloor frac 2n 3 rfloor landmark are suffici for thi purpos
in thi paper we discuss the problem for orthogon polygon and show that frac n 2 landmark suffic for trilater an orthogonaln-gon
thi theoret achiev is import for most evolutionari algorithm and neuro-comput techniqu which need more speedup and high effici .
