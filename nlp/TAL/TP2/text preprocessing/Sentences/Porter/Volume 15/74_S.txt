papr reduct and spectrum sens in mimo system with optim model
cognit radio is trend domain which provid strong solut for address spectrum scarciti issu
mani cognit radio standard suffer from high peak to averag power ratio papr which may distort transmit signal
thi paper propos a techniqu for spectrum sens base on optim enabl papr use hybrid gaussian mixtur model gmm
the eigen statist energi and papr reduct block is adapt by hybrid mixtur model for predict the avail of spectrum
in order to model network with papr the newli design optim algorithm name elephant-sunflow optim eso is adapt
the propos eso techniqu is combin of eleph herd optim and sunflow optim
the gmm is enabl use eigen statist energi along with papr
the gmm is adjust with an optim algorithm name whale elephant-herd optim
the papr is reduc by optim adjust the paramet use propos eso
the channel avail is evalu by provid energi eigen statist and papr as input
the effect of propos eso is illustr with maxim probabl of detect of 1.00 minim papr of 7.534 and minim bit error rate of 0.000 respect .
