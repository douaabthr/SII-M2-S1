vine copula-bas eda for dynam multiobject optim
dynam multiobject problem cover a set of real-world problem that have mani conflict object
these problem are challeng and well known by the dynam natur of their object function constraint function and problem paramet which often chang over time
in fact deal with these problem ha not been investig in detail use the estim of distribut algorithm eda
thu we propos in thi paper an eda-bas on vine copula algorithm to deal with dynam multiobject problem dmop
vine copula are graphic model that repres multivari depend use bivari copula
the propos copula-bas estim of distribut algorithm label dynam vine-copula estim of distribut algorithm dynvc-eda is use to implement two search strategi
the first strategi is an algorithm that use the model as a memori to save the statu of the best solut obtain dure the current gener
the second strategi is a prediction-bas algorithm that use the histori of the best solut to predict a new popul when a chang occur
the propos algorithm are test use a set of benchmark provid with cec2015 and the gee-tan-abbass
statist find show that the dynvc-eda is competit to the state-of-the-art method in deal with dynam multiobject optim .
