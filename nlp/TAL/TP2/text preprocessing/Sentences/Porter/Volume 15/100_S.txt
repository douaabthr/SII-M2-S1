automat select of hidden neuron and weight in neural network for data classif use hybrid particl swarm optim multi-vers optim base on lévi flight
within neural network it is consid a difficult task to find optim valu for the number of hidden neuron and connect weight simultan
thi is becaus alter the hidden neuron significantli affect a neural network s structur and increas the difficulti of the train process which need special consider
particl swarm optim pso is one of the most import metaheurist algorithm due to it converg speed and it simplic of implement
multi-vers optim mvo base on lévi flight is a recent and fast algorithm and can avoid prematur converg and can achiev a better balanc between explor and exploit
thi paper present a new train method base on hybrid particl swarm optim with multi-vers optim base on lévi flight plmvo to optim the number of hidden neuron and connect weight simultan in feedforward neural network ffnn
the hybrid algorithm is util to search better in solut space which prove it effici in reduc the problem of trap in local minima
to evalu the propos algorithm we use three experiment seri
in the first one the propos plmvo algorithm is compar with the mvo and pso algorithm to solv a set of 15 benchmark function to find the global solut
meanwhil in the second experi the perform of the propos approach wa compar with five evolutionari techniqu and the standard momentum backpropag and adapt learn rate
the comparison wa benchmark and evalu use nine bio-med dataset
the result of the compar studi show that plmvo outperform other train method in most dataset and can be an altern to other train method
in the third experi the propos plmvo-mlp is use to predict malici execut linux file
the implement model achiev veri promis result with veri high accuraci of 1.0 and an averag f-measur of 1.0 .
