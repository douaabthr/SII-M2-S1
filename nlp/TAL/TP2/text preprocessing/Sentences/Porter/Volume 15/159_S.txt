yolov2 acceler use embed gpu and fpga pro con and a hybrid method
yolov2 is an object detect algorithm ground on the darknet neural network wide appli in the advanc driver assist system
nevertheless the yolov2 algorithm must be acceler on a high-perform comput platform befor be put into practic usag
variou comput platform have their specif featur
the merit or drawback of the acceler platform are hard for the develop to recogn and pick up the right altern base on real demand
thi paper analyz the pro and con of embed gpu and fpga for improv the yolov2 algorithm concern develop speed power effici and comput perform
the analysi provid the develop with insight into choos the hardwar to optim the yolov2 algorithm
accord to the experiment data it is found that if fpga is optim profoundli the perform of power effici as well as speed will exceed embed gpu
howev the fpga develop procedur is tough and demand much more time for develop than the gpu develop process
final we propos a balanc method to take advantag of gpu s develop speed and fgpa s high perform .
