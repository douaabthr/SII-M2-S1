grey wolf assist sift for improv copi move imag forgeri detect
copy-mov forgeri is a gener widespread type of digit imag forgeri where a segment of an imag is attach into a new portion of the similar imag to hide or replic the part which are call forger imag
the forger imag appear origin as the object region in spite of be forg ha attain the fundament qualiti of the similar imag itself
the capabl of the copy-mov forgeri detect cmfd techniqu is lack due to some post-process function like jpeg compress scale or rotat etc
therefor thi paper intend to develop a cmfd use scale-invari featur transform sift best-fin-first algorithm bbf and random sampl consensu ransac direct by grey wolf optim gwo algorithm
initi the keypoint are select use sift principl and bbf algorithm identifi the match keypoint use keypoint threshold
further sift featur descriptor is determin and the final extract pair keypoint are given to ransac algorithm to remov all the mismatch keypoint
in thi cmfd model the paramet such as paramet keypoint threshold maximum distanc of inlier in ransac and distanc threshold in sift featur are optim use gwo
the foremost purpos of thi research work is maxim the number of pair keypoint
henc the propos model is term as gwo-bas paramet optim for cmfd gwpo-cmd
the propos model is compar over sever other meta-heuristic-bas keypoint threshold select and prove it effici through divers analysi .
