optim sensor placement scheme for target coverag with minim interfer use bbo
a wireless sensor network wsn consist of a group of energy-constrain tini devic call sensor which have sens process and commun capabl
these sensor are deploy in a region of interest for monitor target or detect event and forward the process data to the sink node or gateway
in ani wireless network scenario the target are to be cover by at least one sensor in the network in order to detect certain event
maxim coverag along with improv energi effici of the network is a fundament issu in wsn
therefor a biogeographi base optim bbo meta-heurist techniqu is employ to place sensor in the region of interest
the propos scheme solv a multi-object problem use classic weight sum approach
a fit function is deriv from combin of conflict object minimum interfer maximum target coverag and select of minimum number of sensor node along with connect of the network as a constraint
the scheme select minimum number of sensor to deploy in the field of interest which maxim the target coverag by minim the interfer of sensor
the propos scheme is test on random and grid deploy scenario
final the scheme is compar with genet algorithm and random scheme
the averag interfer energi loss on bbo-bas scheme is found to be 16% less than that of the ga-bas scheme and 60% less than that of a random-bas scheme .
