fab classif of acut leukemia use an ensembl of neural network
acut leukemia is the most frequent occur malign present in human blood and a kind of liquid cancer
thi hematolog disord can imping on bone marrow and lymphat system
accordingli a computer-aid classif system is propos for french american british classif of acut leukemia use an ensembl of neural network which is valid on 180 microscop blood imag taken from onlin benchmark dataset
as per the requir of pathologist in real-lif examin scenario variou object are formul as i correct nucleu segment in blood cell imag ii correct classif of fab class of acut leukemia l1 l2 l3 m2 m3 and m5
to accomplish these research object the propos method consist of segment section featur extract section featur prune section and classif section
the classif of the propos method consist of two subsect as subsection1 is compris of singl six class pca base neural network as pca-nn0 l1/l2/l3/m2/m3/m5 and subsect 2 contain an ensembl of 15 binari pca base neural network classifi as pca-nn1 l1/l2 pca-nn2 l1/l3 pca-nn3 l1/m2 pca-nn4 l1/m3 pca-nn5 l1/m5 pca-nn6 l2/l3 pca-nn7 l2/m2 pca-nn8 l2/m3 pca-nn9 l2/m5 pca-nn10 l3/m2 pca-nn11 l3/m3 pca-nn12 l3/m5 pca-nn13 m2/m3 pca-nn14 m2/m5 pca-nn15 m3/m5
the achiev accuraci for experi 1 is 86.4% use pca-nn0
the output of two most plausibl class predict by pca-nn0 is pass to other binari pca base neural network i. e
pca-nn1 to pca-nn15
after pass all the test imag to subsect 2 the achiev accuraci is 94.2% from the exhaust experi 2
the outcom of the work verifi the capabl of computer-aid classif system to substitut the convent diagnost system .
