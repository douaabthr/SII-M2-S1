compar analysi of machin learn algorithm for lip print base person identif
human identif is center on the theori that everi individu is uniqu and ha distinct characterist
variou metric like fingerprint dna and retina can be use for thi purpos
nonetheless there is still a need for reliabl altern in order to establish the ident of an individu on occas where the abov techniqu are unavail
cheiloscopi is a techniqu of identifi an individu base on lip print
it find applic in medic field predominantli in the forens odontolog
the pattern form on the human lip and it s shape is found to be uniqu for everi individu
pattern found on the human lip are perpetu unless subject to major trauma or alter
analog to the exist bio metric lip print can serv the purpos of confirm an individu s ident
the main object of thi work is to design a robust computer-aid system that would identifi an individu sole base on the lip-print and work across divers dataset
local binari pattern are use to extract the textur base featur from the segment upper and lower lip
shape relat featur are also extract as a part of the featur extract process
final the extract featur are classifi use variou classifi like support vector machin svm k-nearest neighbour knn ensembl classifi and neural network
perform of each and everi classifi is analyz
the classif result show that the featur extract from the upper and the lower lip region can be satisfactorili use to identifi a person uniqu .
