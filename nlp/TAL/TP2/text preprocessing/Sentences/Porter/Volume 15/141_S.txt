neural multi-task collabor filter
in recommend system the rate matrix is often veri spars
collabor filter recommend algorithm cannot be appli to spars matric or use in cold start problem
although the user trust relationship provid some use addit inform for recommend system the exist research ha not incorpor the rate matrix and trust relationship well
the trust relationship itself also ha the problem of data sparsiti
with a focu on the problem of sparsiti and low accuraci in collabor filter algorithm thi paper propos a gener framework call neural multi-task collabor filter nmcf which can simultan predict the rate and trust relationship
that is the rate of the same user in e-commerc platform and the trust relationship in social network promot and complement each other and help to improv the predict accuraci of both
the studi result for three dataset of real-world show that our algorithm perform better in recommend and the accuraci of the propos algorithm is significantli improv compar with that of the comparison model .
