effect of the distanc function on the distance-bas instanc select for the feed-forward neural network
the distance-bas instanc select algorithm for the feed-forward neural network is a numeros reduct techniqu
it select onli the instanc at the decis boundari between consecut class of data to lessen the number of instanc in the origin train set use the euclidean distanc function
thi paper studi improv of the reduct perform and the classif perform of the nine distanc function in the distance-bas instanc select algorithm
the evalu wa conduct on the real-world data set from the uci machin learn repositori and elena project
the data reduct perform result confirm that the chebyshev cosin and minkowski distanc function are recommend for the integ data type
the minkowski distanc function is recommend for the categor data type
the jaccard distanc function is recommend for the real data type
the select of the initi distanc function base on the data type can make the distance-bas instanc select algorithm produc the best classif perform .
