multi-view fusion for recommend with attent deep neural network
recommend system have been wide develop and introduc in numer applic
howev due to the lack of suffici user feedback data the recommend perform of such system is often affect by data sparsiti
to address thi problem a multi-view fusion recommend algorithm with an attent deep neural network is propos
a two-stag joint learn solut is design in the propos model which combin user attribut item attribut and user-item interact inform into a unifi framework
the convolut neural network and attent mechan are appli to improv effect of extract featur from user and item attribut
the extend deep neural network model base on matrix factor and multiple-lay percept is use to enhanc the featur extract of user and item interact inform
experiment result on the movielens-1 m and book-cross real dataset show that the propos algorithm can achiev the best recommend accuraci compar with other classic recommend algorithm even with extrem spars data .
