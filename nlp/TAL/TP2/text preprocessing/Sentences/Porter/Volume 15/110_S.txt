predict the pandem sentiment evalu and predict analysi from large-scal tweet on covid-19 by deep convolut neural network
engag deep neural network for textual sentiment analysi is an extens practic domain of research
textual sentiment classif har the full comput potenti of deep learn model
typic these research work are carri either with a popular open-sourc data corpu or self-extract short phrase text from twitter reddit or web-scrap text data from other resourc
rare do we see a larg amount of data on a current ongo event is be collect and cultur further
also an even more complex task would be to model the data from a current ongo event not onli for scale the sentiment accuraci but also for make a predict analysi for the same
in thi paper we propos a novel approach for achiev sentiment evalu accuraci by use a deep neural network on live-stream tweet on coronaviru and futur case growth predict
we develop a larg tweet corpu exclus base on the coronaviru tweet
we split the data into train and test set alongsid we perform polar classif and trend analysi
the refin outcom from the trend analysi help to train the data to provid an increment learn curvatur for our neural network and we obtain an accuraci of 90.67%
final we provid a statistical-bas futur predict for coronaviru case growth
not onli our model outperform sever previou state-of-art experi in overal sentiment accuraci comparison for similar task but it also maintain a throughout perform stabil among all the test case when test with sever popular open-sourc text corpora .
