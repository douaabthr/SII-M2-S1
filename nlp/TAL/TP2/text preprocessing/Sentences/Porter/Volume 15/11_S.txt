analysi on intellig machin learn enabl with meta-heurist algorithm for solar irradi predict
the solar forecast is an effect method to enhanc the oper of an electr system for merg a larg amount of solar power gener system and intend to expand a new empir method to model the predict uncertainti of the solar irradi
the propos model compris three phase such as a data acquisit b featur extract and c predict
initi benchmark data avail from local meteorolog organ are collect that includ the numer weather forecast data like temperatur dew point humid visibl wind speed and other descript inform
onc the data is collect featur extract is done by first-ord and second-ord statist model
first order statist like mean median standard deviat the maximum valu of entir data and minimum valu of entir data and second-ord statist like kurtosi skew correl and entropi are extract as the featur
these featur are further appli to three machin learn algorithm name multilay perceptron mlp convolut neural network cnn and recurr neural network rnn
as main novelti of thi paper the number of hidden neuron of all these network is optim by a hybrid algorithm merg both the deer hunt optim algorithm dhoa and grey wolf optim gwo which is name as grey updat dhoa gu-dhoa
the improv of these network with the assist of a hybrid meta-heurist algorithm will be highli effect for solar irradi predict overcom the exist machin learn algorithm .
