somdroid android malwar detect by artifici neural network train use unsupervis learn
android ha gain it popular due to it open-sourc and number of freeli avail app in it offici play store
appropri function of android app depend upon the permiss or set of permiss which an app demand at the time of instal and run-tim
by take the advantag of these permiss or set of permiss cybercrimin are develop malware-infect app daili
in thi studi we propos a framework name as somdroid that work on the principl of unsupervis machin learn algorithm
to develop an effect and effici android malwar detect model we collect 5,00 000 distinct android app from promis repositori and extract 1844 uniqu featur
further to select signific featur or featur set we appli six differ featur rank approach in thi studi
with the select featur or featur set we implement the self-organ map som algorithm of kohonen and measur four distinct perform paramet i.e. intra-clust distanc inter-clust distanc accuraci and f-measur
empir result reveal that our propos framework is abl to detect 98.7% malwar that belong to unknown famili and in addit to that the detect rate is higher by 2% when compar to commerci anti-viru scanner and framework propos in the literatur .
