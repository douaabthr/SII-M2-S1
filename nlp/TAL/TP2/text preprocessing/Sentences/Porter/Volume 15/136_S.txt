frequenc offset estim base on a combin of fft and czt for dp-qdb coher receiv
a new frequency-offset-estim foe method for dual-polar quadratur duobinari modul dp-qdb which is base on a combin of fast fourier transform fft and chirp z transform czt is propos
thi method is investig at 128 gb/ in five-channel wavelength-division-multiplex dp-qdb system by simul
the simul result show that the propos method can greatli promot foe accuraci
when the propos method with fft and czt point of 1024 is compar with the tradit unimprov method with fft point of 2048 the former is 70% lower than the latter in foe error in the case of basic the same comput complex
besid two foe implement scheme for dp-qdb are compar
it is found that the implement scheme in which the foe modul is put after the post filter ha better estim perform .
