optim base rout model for the dynam path plan of emerg vehicl
with the increas number of traffic vehicl and urban the frequenc of traffic accid are grow exponenti
the research for rout emerg vehicl ha gain signific attent in vehicular ad hoc network vanet topolog
the path plan for an emerg vehicl can avoid congest and minim the travel time to prevent accid
thu thi work propos a dynam path plan scheme for rout emerg vehicl
at first the vanet is simul and the dynam path plan is perform after the arriv of emerg vehicl
the propos dynam path plan includ two step name travel-tim forecast and bi-model rout
the travel time is predict use the support vector regress model and the bimod is employ to rout the emerg vehicl optim
the bimod consist of two step such as k-path discoveri and optim path select process
initi the possibl k shortest path is detect from which the optim path is select by the propos exponenti bird swarm optim algorithm exp-bsa
the propos exp-bsa algorithm is design by integr the exponenti weight move averag concept in bird swarm algorithm bsa
thu the propos exp-bsa determin the optim path base on the devis fit function and the select path are suggest to emerg vehicl for faster rout
the perform of the propos dynam path plan for an emerg vehicl base on exp-bsa is evalu use three simul setup base on the metric such as distanc averag traffic densiti averag speed and travel time
also the perform of the propos method is compar with the exist method such as sfla-kc k-path and bsa
from the result it is expos that the propos exp-bsa method achiev the overal best perform than the exist method with a minim distanc of 48.404 m an averag traffic densiti of 0.015 min an averag speed of 1.392 m/ travel time of 19.608 s.
