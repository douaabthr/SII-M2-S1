dynam kidney pair exchang use modifi multivers optim
kidney exchang is among the effect method that may perman suppli an import platform for incompat donor-candid pair to exchang organ to achiev mutual benefit and guarante treatment to peopl with kidney failur
howev build a dynam model for kidney pair exchang ha becom an increasingli urgent issu for augment the number of avail kidney in the field of organ transplant
there ha not been made a lot of research on the kidney exchang problem in a dynam situat
mathemat maxim the possibl kidney exchang for a given pool can be consid as an optim problem and ha attract the attent of the commun of research in the past few year
thu optim approach like natural-inspir algorithm can help kidney pair exchang in defin which transplant should be made among all incompat pair accord to some object
in thi paper a new natur stochastic-bas algorithm call a multivers optim is introduc to develop advanc dynam approach for kidney pair exchang
the object of the propos approach is to maxim the number of feasibl cycl and chain among the pool pair over time
the effect of the propos method is confirm by provid the best perform compar to the result of genet and antlion algorithm which are the onli stochastic-bas optim algorithm appli to the kidney exchang
furthermor we appli more stochastic-bas optim algorithm for kidney pair exchang to confirm the overal perform superior of our propos method
the perform of the propos method in a dynam situat demonstr the competit of the propos method .
