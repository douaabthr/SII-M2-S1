variabl select for gener partial linear model with longitudin data
variabl select and paramet estim are of great signific in all regress analysi
a varieti of approach have been propos to tackl thi problem
among those the penalty-bas shrinkag approach ha been most popular for the abil to carri out the variabl select and paramet estim simultan
howev not much work is avail on the variabl select for the gener partial model gplm with longitudin data
in thi paper we propos a variabl select procedur for gplm with longitudin data
the infer is base on the scad-pen quadrat infer function which is obtain after the b-spline approxim to non-parametr function in the model
the propos approach effici util the within-clust correl inform which can improv estim effici
the propos approach also ha the virtu of low comput cost
with the tune paramet chosen by bic the correct model is identifi with probabl tend to 1
the result estim of the parametr compon is asymptot to a normal distribut and that of the non-parametr function achiev the optim converg rate
the perform of the propos method is evalu through extens simul studi
a real data analysi show that the propos approach succe in exclud the insignific variabl .
