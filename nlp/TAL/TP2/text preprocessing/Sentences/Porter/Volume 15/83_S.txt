bayesian fusion strategi for move target detect in multichannel sar framework
target detect is one of the import subfield in the research of synthet apertur radar sar
it face mani challeng due to the stationari object lead to the presenc of a scatter signal
mani research have been done on target detect and most of them prefer filter base techniqu
in thi work the move target detect in sar use decis fusion method is propos
the newli develop scheme is name bayesian fusion for move target detect bf-mtd as the scheme util the bayesian model for identifi the target locat
initi the receiv signal from the sar are fed through the short-tim fourier transform stft and the match filter for identifi the target locat
then the result are fuse togeth by the bayesian fusion strategi for find the actual target
for the fusion the naiv bay classifi is use for determin the optim paramet for the target detect
the simul of the propos bf-mtd model is evalu by vari target iter puls repetit level and antenna turn veloc of the sar
simul result reveal that the propos bf-mtd ha achiev signific perform for a detect time miss target rate and mean squar error respect .
