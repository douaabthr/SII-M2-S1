optim schedul algorithm for soft real-tim system use particl swarm optim techniqu
schedul of task in real-tim system is base on static or dynam prioriti like earliest deadlin first edf and rate monoton respect
the static schedul doe not give assur of schedul all task dure the underload scenario wherea dynam schedul perform poorli dure an overload scenario
thi paper ha propos a swarm intelligence-bas schedul algorithm that can overcom both the situat
thi paper ha use particl swarm optim pso base swarm techniqu to design the new schedul approach
it consid each task as a particl and appli modifi pso techniqu to identifi the most critic task to execut
the effici of the newli propos method ha been compar with exist edf and aco base schedul algorithm consid two signific paramet the success ratio and the effect cpu util
all three algorithm have been test on the simul with a soft real-tim period task set on 500 timelin
it ha been observ that dure the underload scenario the propos algorithm perform equal to edf and aco base algorithm
dure overload and highli overload situat the propos algorithm perform batter compar to edf and aco base algorithm .
