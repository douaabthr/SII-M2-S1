research on automat clean algorithm of multi-dimension network redund data base on big data
in order to realiz the research on network redund data clean base on big data thi paper design a set of redund data clean framework accord to the data process flow befor data analysi
accord to the spatial correl of redund data a method of data clean is design
in the data clean method appropri clean algorithm are design for abnorm data and miss data respect in which mathemat probabl design is appli to abnorm data to delet the data with obviou deviat from the normal data valu
the spatial model and algorithm are design by appli spatial correl to the miss data to fill the miss data valu after the redund data is clean by other step in the method
the accuraci of the model is compar with that of the common data predict algorithm and the accuraci between the algorithm and the redund data set is verifi .
