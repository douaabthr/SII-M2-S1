paramet extract of solar cell use intellig grey wolf optim
the focu of power produc ha shift from convent energi sourc to sustain energi sourc becaus of the deplet of fossil fuel and carbon emiss caus global warm and climat chang
solar cell are the most promin option to deal with these problem
the precis estim of solar cell paramet is veri much requir befor their instal to achiev high effici
in recent year applic of sever optim algorithm for paramet estim of the solar cell have been address
recent intellig grey wolf optim igwo which is an advanc version of grey wolf optim gwo incorpor a sinusoid truncat function as a bridg mechan and opposit base learn ha been introduc
the wide applic of thi variant ha been examin over differ convent benchmark function and on some real problem
thi fact motiv author to employ thi variant on paramet extract process
the main motiv behind the implement of igwo on solar cell paramet estim process is the effici of thi version to deal with complex optim problem
to estim the pv cell paramet valu measur of voltag and current are consid at three import point
these are open circuit point short circuit point and maximum power point for two solar cell repres model i. e
singl diod model and doubl diod model
result of igwo are compar with the result of other variant of gwo on these two model and for three film mono crystallin poli crystallin and thin film
result reveal that igwo produc better result .
