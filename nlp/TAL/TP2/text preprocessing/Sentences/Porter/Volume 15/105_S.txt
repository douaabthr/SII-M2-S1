hyperspectr imag classif use support vector machin a spectral spatial featur base approach
recent spectral spatial inform base algorithm are gain more attent becaus of it robust accuraci and effici
in thi paper an svm base classif method ha been propos which extract featur consid both spectral and spatial inform
the propos method exploit svm to encod spectral spatial inform of pixel and also use for classif task
a clean comparison of rel gain achiev with inclus of spatial featur with it spectral counterpart is also investig
the experi ha been perform use three benchmark dataset indian pine pavia univers and salina
experi show that the propos method outperform the classif algorithm k nearest neighbor linear discrimin analysi naiv bay and decis tree .
