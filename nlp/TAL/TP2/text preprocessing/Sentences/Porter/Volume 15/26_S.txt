protect scheme for hybrid transmiss system use fuzzi infer system and microcontrol
thi paper present a fuzzi infer system and microcontroller-bas protect scheme for a combin underground ug cabl and overhead oh transmiss line system
the scheme detect classifi and locat the fault occur either in an ug cabl or oh transmiss line network
furthermor the scheme identifi the faulti section
an exist indian power network i.e. real power system network of c. g
state consist of 132 kv 50 hz power transmiss network connect doma substat 220 132 kv to the 132 33 kv ga insul substat rawanbhata through combin transmiss network is consid
thi real power transmiss network is simul by use matlab/simulink softwar
in thi paper the hardwar implement is also carri out use an open-sourc hardwar arduino which consist of an atmel 8 bit avr microcontrol
both the simul and hardwar result valid that the propos scheme is accur detect classifi and locat the fault in less than a half cycl time
moreov the percentag error in determin the locat of a fault is less than 0.7% .
