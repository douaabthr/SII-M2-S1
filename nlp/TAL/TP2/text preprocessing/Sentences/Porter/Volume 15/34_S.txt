a compar approach to multiobject optim of aisc thin-wal member
optim of structur member such as beam and column ha receiv increas interest with advanc in comput manufactur and artifici intellig
design pursu multiobject optim are typic interest in minim the cost of the member while maxim some perform metric relat to load bear capabl or stress
in thi studi thin-wal member list in aisc tabl were optim in a similar manner use genet algorithm
the influenc of sever object wa consid and emphasi wa place on provid the custom with a divers choic of solut
to demonstr the approach wide-flang i-beam and circular pipe cross-sect were examin
multi-dimension pareto-front were obtain
optim cross-sect were compar to aisc beam tabl
multi-criteria decision-mak techniqu were use to select a prefer solut from a pareto-front
for i-beam improv of 3 7% over tabl were obtain and for pipe it wa 47 76%
final the perform of two commonli use genet algorithm nsga-ii and spea-ii wa compar use pareto-front metric
while spea-ii produc sever nondomin solut nsga-ii wa shown to produc the overal superior front consid metric present from the literatur .
