imperialist competit algorithm-bas deep belief network for food recognit and calori estim
the vulner of the health issu have result in the altern to manag the situat which ensur the better in life
the dietari assess stand as an effect solut for most of the health vulner and the automat assess takes-off the manual procedur of assess the food intak
thi paper introduc an automat method of dietari assess by propos the imperialist competit algorithm ipca base deep belief network ipca-dbn for food categori recognit and the calori estim of the food
initi the food imag is pre-process and subject to the segment process which is done by the bayesian fuzzi cluster
then the featur such as shape color histogram wavelet scatter transform featur are gener from the optim segment
final these featur are fed to the ipca-dbn for recogn the food categori and estim the calori of the food
the experiment perform use the unimib2016 dataset enabl the effect analysi of the propos method in term of the metric such as macro averag accuraci maa standard accuraci sa and mean squar error mse
the analysi prove that the propos method outperform the exist method and attain 0.9643 for maa 0.9877 for sa and 1816.9 for mse .
