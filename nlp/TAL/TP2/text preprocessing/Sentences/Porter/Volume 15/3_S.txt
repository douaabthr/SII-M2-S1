a modifi teach learn metaheurist algorithm with opposite-bas learn for permut flow-shop schedul problem
teaching-learning-bas optim is one of the well-known metaheurist algorithm in the research industri
recent variou population-bas algorithm have been develop for solv optim problem
in thi paper a random scale factor approach is propos to modifi the simpl tlbo algorithm
modifi teaching-learning-bas optim with opposite-based-learn algorithm is appli to solv the permut flow-shop-schedul problem with the purpos of minim the makespan
the obl approach is use to enhanc the qualiti of the initi popul and converg speed
pfssp is use extens for solv schedul problem which belong to the categori of np-hard optim problem
first mtlbo is develop to effect determin the pfssp use the largest order valu rule-bas random key so that individu job schedul are convert into discret schedul
second new initi popul are gener in mtlbo use the nawaz enscor ham heurist mechan
final the local exploit abil is enhanc in the mtlbo use effect swap insert and invers structur
the perform of propos algorithm is valid use ten benchmark function and the wilcoxon rank test
the comput result and comparison indic that the propos algorithm outperform over five well-known dataset such as carlier reev heller taillard and vrf benchmark test function compar to other metaheurist algorithm
thep-valu indic the signific and superior of the propos algorithm over other metaheurist algorithm .
