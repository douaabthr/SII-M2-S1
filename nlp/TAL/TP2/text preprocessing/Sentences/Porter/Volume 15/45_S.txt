fraction weightag base object function to a hybrid optim algorithm for model transform
model transform mt contribut a major role in the model-driven engin mde which are use to transfer the model among variou languag to refactor and simul the model or to obtain the use code from the model
thu the need for mt in mde is veri import but the practic method are not suitabl for the detect of error in transform
thi paper propos an advanc algorithm call fraction whale optim integr adapt dragonfli f-woadf algorithm to perform the mt from the class diagram cld to relat schema rs model
the propos algorithm modifi the adapt dragonfli adf algorithm with the concept of whale optim algorithm woa use the fraction theori
the uml cld is transform into the rs model use the optim block that are select with the use of the propos algorithm
the perform of the f-woadf method is evalu use automat correct ac and fit measur
the propos method produc the maximum ac of 0.8583 and the maximum fit measur of 0.8984 that indic the effect of the propos method .
