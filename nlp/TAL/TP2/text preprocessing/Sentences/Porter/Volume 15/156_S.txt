optim perform of handl machin in timber worksit
with an intens growth of innov technolog implement nowaday the main problem is to evalu the respect of the use technolog and increas the product of load and transport oper of the timber industri
thi work aim to analyz the technolog and econom factor affect the product and cost of oper of modern load machin use at enterpris in russia
compar analysi is perform between the front loader of sennebogen liebherr volvo fuch with articul steer highlift loader and full-circl timber materi handl machin
the result of the analysi of the loader physic characterist show that at increas the machin weight by 1.5 time oper cost increas correspondingli by about 1.5 time while output capac doubl
stall load rate for front loader depend on the posit of the bar and the arm span and the optim condit of effici function and cost structur for these type of load machin are establish
the obtain result can be use for futur scientif research and appli in industri enterpris as technolog recommend .
