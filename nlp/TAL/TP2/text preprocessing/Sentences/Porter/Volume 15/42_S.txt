editori
thank you for give me thi opportun to act as the guest editor of thi special issu which is on nature-inspir algorithm for high-perform comput in comput vision
to tackl complex real-world problem scientist have been look into natur process and creatur both as model and metaphor for year
optim is at the heart of mani natur process includ darwinian evolut social group behavior and forag strategi
over the last few decad there ha been remark growth in the field of nature-inspir search and optim algorithm
nature-inspir algorithm provid a systemat introduct to all major nature-inspir optim algorithm for optim
current these techniqu are appli to a varieti of problem rang from scientif research to industri and commerc
the two main famili of algorithm that primarili constitut thi field today are the evolutionari comput method and the swarm intellig algorithm
although both famili of algorithm are gener dedic to solv search and optim problem they are certainli not equival and each ha it own distinguish featur
reinforc each other s perform make power hybrid algorithm capabl of solv mani intract search and optim problem
mani problem in scienc and engin can be formul as optim problem subject to complex nonlinear constraint
the solut to highli nonlinear problem usual requir sophist optim algorithm and tradit algorithm may struggl to deal with such problem .
