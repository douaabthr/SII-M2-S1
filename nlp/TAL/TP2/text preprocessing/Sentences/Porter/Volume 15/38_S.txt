optim schedul of a micro-grid with multi-period island constraint use hybrid cfc techniqu
thi paper propos an effici techniqu for optimum schedul of micro-grid with multi-period island restrict
the propos method is joint implement of cuttl fish algorithm cfa and crow search algorithm csa is known cfc method
here the cfa search behavior is modifi by the csa updat posit
the propos cfc system is util for optim schedul of micro-grid and consider decreas the calcul load
the main purpos of propos work is diminish the micro-grid oper cost togeth with the dispatch- unit oper cost cost of power transmiss as main grid with inconveni cost recogn with consum
the cost of power transmiss from main phase can be posit or neg base on the flow direct of transmiss line link the microcircuit to main phase
neg cost that repres an export of power to main grid emerg as econom advantag of micro-grid
cost of inconveni impli the penalti of modifi load program outsid the time interv particular by the consum
constant penalti factor is util for priorit load with respect to oper sensit insid the particular time interv in which a superior valu of the penalti factor impli a least flexibl load base on time interv oper set
the valu of the penalti factor is chosen reason greater to unit gener cost and market price
in propos techniqu the cfc is use for establish the correct program of the mg combin accord to load side power rang
the cfc method object function can be defin as system data subject to equal and inequ limit
at that time cfc model is perform at matlab/simulink work platform and perform is estim to exist techniqu .
