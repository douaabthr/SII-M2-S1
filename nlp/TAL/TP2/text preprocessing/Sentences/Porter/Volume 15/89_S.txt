automat handwritten charact recognit of devanagari languag a hybrid train algorithm for neural network
in the field of imag process and artifici intellig the charact recognit and handwritten recognit have been emerg as one of the activ and challeng research area
in recent year there ha been a notabl develop in the research associ with charact recognit in handwritten devanagari document
to improv the recognit perform thi paper tactic to develop new handwritten charact recognit model use an improv machin learn approach
the propos charact recognit model includ four stage like pre-process segment featur extract and classif
initi the scan handwritten document for devanagari languag is subject to pre-process which includ stage like rgb to gray threshold complement of imag morpholog oper linear and nois remov use median filter
then the charact of the pre-process imag are segment use k-mean cluster that is a popular method for cluster analysi
further the featur like kirsch direct edg freeman chain code and neighborhood distanc weight use delaunay triangul are extract from the segment charact
subsequ the classif of charact is done use neural network nn where the new train algorithm is use in which the weight are optim use a hybrid optim by combin lion optim algorithm and grey wolf optim gwo
here the updat procedur of gwo is base on la algorithm and henc the propos algorithm is name as lion updat gwo lu-gwo
to the next of the implement a valuabl compar analysi confirm the improv perform of the propos lu-gwo-nn model over convent method in classifi the conson numer and vowel from differ charact .
