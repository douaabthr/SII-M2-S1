advanc central and distribut svm model over differ iot level for edg layer intellig and control
in thi era internet-of-th iot deal with billion of edg devic potenti connect to each other
maximum applic built on these edg devic gener a massiv amount of onlin data and also requir real-tim comput and decis make with low latenc e.g. robot drone self-driv car smart iot electron wearabl devic
to suffic the requir the futur gener intellig edg devic need to be capabl of comput complex machin learn algorithm on live data in real-tim
consid differ layer of iot and distribut comput concept thi paper suggest three differ oper model where the ml algorithm will be execut in a distribut manner between the edg and cloud layer of iot so that the edg node can take a decis in real-tim
the three model are model 1 train and predict both will be done local by the edg model 2 train at the server and decis make at the edg node and model 3 distribut train and distribut decis make at the edg level with global share knowledg and secur
all three model have been test use support vector machin use thirteen divers dataset to profil their perform in term of both train and infer time
a compar studi between the comput perform of the edg and cloud node is also present here
through the simul experi use the differ dataset it is observ that the edg node infer time is approxim ten time faster than cloud time for all test dataset for each propos model
at the same time the model 2 train time is approxim nine time faster than model 1 and eleven time faster than model 3 .
