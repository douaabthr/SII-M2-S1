wrapper scan chain design algorithm for test of embed core base on chaotic dragonfli algorithm
as embed pre-design and pre-valid core in system-on-chip soc design have increas usag the wrapper scan chain design wscd for the embed core is one of the fundament way to reduc the soc test time
in thi paper a chaotic dragonfli algorithm cda for wscd is propos to minim the test time of embed core by balanc the packag scan chain wsc . sinc the wscd problem is non-continu we improv the dragonfli algorithm da with integ code to make it suitabl for the wscd problem
in order to improv popul divers and prevent fall into local optimum state we introduc chaotic strategi into da
furthermor a repair oper that consid the specif knowledg is ad to the da
sinc the cda is a swarm intellig method it is expect to effect solv the np-hard problem
the experiment result on itc 02 soc benchmark show that the propos algorithm can improv the balanc result and shorten the test time compar with the exist algorithm .
