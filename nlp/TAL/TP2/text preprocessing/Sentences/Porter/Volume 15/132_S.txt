softwar fault classif use extrem learn machin a cognit approach
the softwar fault classif is veri crucial in the develop of reliabl and high-qual softwar product
the fault classif allow determin and concentr on fault softwar modul for earli predict of fault in time
as a result it save the time and money of the industri
gener variou metric are gener to repres the fault
but select the domin metric from the avail set is a challeng
therefor in thi paper a sequenti forward search sf with extrem learn machin elm approach ha use for fault classif
the number of featur avail in the metric are select to repres the fault use sf and oper on elm to verifi the perform of softwar fault classif
also variou activ function of elm have test for the propos work to identifi the best model
the experiment result demonstr that elm with radial basi function achiev the good result compar to other activ function
also the propos method ha shown good result in comparison to support vector machin .
