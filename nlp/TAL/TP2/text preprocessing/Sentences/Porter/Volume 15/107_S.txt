select of inform gene from high-dimension cancer data employ an improvis meta-heurist algorithm
identif of the most promin gene with high classif accuraci in the high-dimension cancer data ha remain an emerg challeng for machin learn research
the select of inform gene is a non-determinist polynomial-tim np-hard issu
therefor a scope alway lie in employ new algorithm in thi field
in thi work an improv version of a meta-heurist algorithm chaotic jaya cjaya is hybrid with kernel extrem learn machin kelm call as cjaya-kelm to select the most inform gene and classifi the high-dimension cancer data
initi the fisher score techniqu is use to pre-select the inform gene
then the cjaya algorithm is employ for both select key gene and optim the paramet of the kelm classifi
to evalu the design model six cancer dataset are consid
here the design model cjaya-kelm ha been compar with particl swarm optim hybrid kelm pso-kelm genet algorithm hybrid kelm ga-kelm and jaya hybrid kelm jaya-kelm model
moreov a comparison between the suggest model with other ten exist model is demonstr here
some perform metric like accuraci in tenfold cross-valid method the number of select gene sensit f-measur specif and matthew correl coeffici mcc are appli to measur the effici of the suggest model
the cjaya-kelm approach result in the highest accuraci sensit and specif in colon tumor . 9677 . 9714 . 963 leukemia . 99 . 9756 1 ovarian cancer 1 1 . 9892 lymphoma-3 . 9971 1 . 9583 all-aml-3 . 9961 . 9767 1 and srbct . 998 1 . 9583 dataset respect
the experiment result reveal that the suggest model cjaya-kelm is outperform .
