optim floor plan in vlsi use improv adapt particl swarm optim
floor plan is necessari to design the vlsi circuit
the complet comput characterist of the manufactur chip are evalu by floor plan process
it is the multi-object problem in which differ object are fulfil at a time
here a new interact self-improv base adapt particl swarm optim isi-apso techniqu is propos to enhanc the explor effici and accuraci than convolut pso
within less comput time the propos isi-apso techniqu attain best global search throughout the space
the simul result show that the propos isi-apso algorithm achiev better perform than other heurist algorithm in explor effici and speed of converg
in order to place the whole modul and their intern connect wire length the multi-object optim method is util
therefor the necessari layout area is minim
moreov the implement result demonstr the import of the propos algorithm with respect to the robust perform .
