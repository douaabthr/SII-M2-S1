a three-stag pso-bas methodolog for tune an optim pd-control for robot arm manipul
six degrees-of-freedom dof robot manipul are dynam coupl and highli nonlinear multi-vari system
calcul the optim joint angl from the oper space i. e
invers kinemat and design the optim joint control paramet are two import research topic
thi paper propos a 3 stage particl swarm optim pso base methodolog for solv the invers kinemat and optim the control paramet
in the first stage a pso algorithm solv the invers kinemat problem by minim a multi-object cost function in the oper space i. e
the error in the end-effector s pose and therefor find the optim joint angl
in the second stage polynomi function gener the desir trajectori between the initi and final pose in the joint space
final a second pso algorithm tune six proportional-deriv pd control one for each joint to track the desir trajectori by minim anoth multi-object cost function in the joint space
two case studi base on six dof puma 560 valid the perform of the propos methodolog
simul result show that the propos 3 stage methodolog provid fast and accur result as the pso algorithm are effect in solv the invers kinemat problem and tune the optim pd paramet .
