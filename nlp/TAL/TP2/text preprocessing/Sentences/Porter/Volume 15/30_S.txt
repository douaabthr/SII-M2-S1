a hybrid approach to energi effici cluster and rout in wireless sensor network
wireless sensor network are develop as a vital tool for monitor divers real time applic such as environment monitor factor health care wide area surveil and mani more
though the advantag of wsn are plenti the present challeng is to gain effect control over the deplet batteri power and the network lifetim
recent research have prove that the energi consumpt can be minim if effect cluster mechan are incorpor
thi paper propos hock and heck novel energi effici cluster algorithm to increas the network lifetim for homogen and heterogen environ respect
both these algorithm are built use krill herd and cuckoo search
while the optim cluster centroid posit are comput use the krill herd algorithm and the cuckoo search is appli to select the optim cluster head
the perform of the hock algorithm is evalu by vari base station locat and node densiti
to evalu the heck algorithm two and three level heterogen are consid
the simul result show that the propos protocol is more effect in improv the network lifetim of wsn compar to other exist method such as gaech hybrid hsapso and eso-leach .
