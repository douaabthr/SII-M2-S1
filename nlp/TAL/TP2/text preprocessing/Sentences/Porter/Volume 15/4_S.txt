toward robot vision use deep neural network in evolutionari robot
in evolutionari robot robot control are often evolv in simul as use the physic robot for fit evalu can take a prohibit long time
simul provid a quick way to evalu control fit
a simul is task with provid appropri sensor inform to the control
if the robot ha an on-board camera an entir virtual visual environ is need to simul the camera s signal
in the past these visual environ have been construct by hand requir the use of hand-craft model textur and light which is a tediou and time-consum process
thi paper propos a deep neural network-bas architectur for simul visual environ
the neural network are train exclus from imag captur from the robot creat a 3 dimension visual environ without use hand-craft model textur or light
it doe not reli on ani extern domain specif dataset as all train data is captur in the physic environ
robot control were evolv in simul to discern between object with differ colour and shape and they success complet the same task in the real world .
