patch-bas pose invari featur for singl sampl face recognit
pose variat is consid as one of the major challeng that degrad the perform of face recognit system
exist techniqu address thi problem from differ attitud
howev these method may be ineffici or impract in the case of singl sampl face recognit
thi articl present an automat patch-bas pose invari featur extract method that can handl pose variat for the aforement case
the propos method extract gabor and histogram of orient gradient featur from landmark-bas patch
the featur are then concaten dimension reduc use princip compon analysi fuse use canon correl analysi and normal use min-max normal
experiment result carri out on the feret databas have shown the outstand perform of the propos method compar to that of the state-of-the-art approach
the propos approach achiev 100 and 96 and 94.5 recognit rate for moder and wide pose variat respect .
