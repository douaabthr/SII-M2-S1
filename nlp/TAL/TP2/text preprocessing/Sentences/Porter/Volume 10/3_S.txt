multilevel imag threshold use entropi of histogram and recent develop population-bas metaheurist algorithm
multilevel threshold is one of the most broadli use approach to imag segment
howev the tradit techniqu of multilevel threshold are time-consum especi when the number of the threshold valu is high
thu population-bas metaheurist p-metaheurist algorithm can be use to overcom thi limit
p-metaheurist algorithm are a type of optim algorithm which improv a set of solut use an iter process
for thi purpos imag threshold problem should be seen as an optim problem
thi paper propos multilevel imag threshold for imag segment use sever recent present p-metaheurist algorithm includ whale optim algorithm grey wolf optim cuckoo optim algorithm biogeography-bas optim teach learning-bas optim gravit search algorithm imperialist competit algorithm and cuckoo search
kapur s entropi is use as the object function
to conduct a more comprehens comparison the mention p-metaheurist algorithm were compar with five other
sever experi were conduct on 12 benchmark imag to compar the algorithm regard object function valu peak signal to nois ratio psnr featur similar index fsim structur similar index ssim and stabil
in addit friedman test and wilcoxon sign rank test were carri out as the nonparametr statist method to compar p-metaheurist algorithm
eventu to creat a more reliabl result anoth object function wa evalu base on cross entropi .
