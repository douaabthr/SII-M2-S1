function approxim with lwpr and xcsf a compar studi
function approxim also call regress is an import tool in numer mathemat and engin
the most challeng approxim problem aris when the function class is unknown and the surfac ha to be approxim onlin from incom sampl
one way to achiev good approxim of complex non-linear function is to cluster the input space into small patch appli linear model in each nich and recombin these model via a weight sum
while it is rather simpl to optim fit a linear model to given data it is fairli complex to find a reason structur of the input space in order to exploit linear in the underli function
we compar two non-parametr regress algorithm that are abl to approxim multi-dimension non-linear function onlin
the xcsf learn classifi system is a modifi version of xc which is agenetics-bas machin learn algorithm
local weight project regress is astatistics-bas machin learn techniqu that is mainli use for function approxim task in robot
for both algorithm the relev conflict perform criteria areaccuracyandpopul size that is the number of local model
we explor the trade-off between those criteria on three benchmark problem by mean of intens grid search for pareto optim solut
detail learn behavior is investig use select pareto optim paramet
the illustr of final input space cluster shed light on the structur capabl
