on princip compon analysi for high-dimension xcsr
xcsr is an accuracy-bas learn classifi system which can handl classif problem with real-valu featur
howev as the number of featur increas a high classif accuraci come at the cost of more resourc larger popul size and longer comput run time
in thi paper we investig pca-xcsr a sequenti applic of pca and xcsr in three environ with differ characterist a discret and imbalanc environ kdd 99 network intrus a continu and highli symmetr environ miniboon and a highli discret highli imbalanc environ census/incom kdd
these experi show that in the three differ environ pca-xcsr in addit to be abl to reduc the comput resourc and time requir of xcsr by approxim 50 is abl to consist maintain it high accuraci
in addit to that it reduc the requir popul size need by xcsr
also we suggest heurist for select the number of princip compon to use when use pca-xcsr .
