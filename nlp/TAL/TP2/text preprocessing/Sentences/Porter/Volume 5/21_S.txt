meta-heurist approach to proport fair
proport fair is a concept from resourc share task amongnus where each user receiv at least 1 nof her or hi total valu of the infinit divis resourc
here we provid an approach to proport fair that allow it extens to discret domain as well as for the direct applic of evolutionari comput to approxim proport fair state
we employ the concept of relat optim where the optim task becom the find of extrem element of a binari relat and defin a proport fair relat correspondingli
by use a rank-ord version of proport fair the so-cal order proport fair we can improv the activ find of maxim proport fair element by evolutionari meta-heurist algorithm
thi is demonstr by use modifi version of the strength pareto evolutionari algorithm version 2 spea2 and multi-object particl swarm optim
in comparison between proport and order proport fair and by use relat spea2 the evolv maximum set of order proport fair achiev 10 more domin case against a set of random vector than proport fair .
