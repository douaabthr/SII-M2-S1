construct control for physic multileg robot use the enso neuroevolut approach
evolv control for multileg robot in simul is conveni and flexibl make it possibl to prototyp idea rapidli
howev transfer the result control to physic robot is challeng becaus it is difficult to simul real-world complex with suffici accuraci
thi paper bridg thi gap by util the evolut of network symmetri and modular enso approach to evolv modular neural network control that are robust to discrep between simul and realiti
thi approach wa evalu by build a physic quadrup robot and by evolv control for it in simul
an approxim model of the robot and it environ wa built in a physic simul and uncertainti in the real world were model as nois
the result control produc well-synchron trot gait when they were transfer to the physic robot even on differ walk surfac
in contrast to a hand-design pid control the evolv control also gener well to chang in experiment condit such as loss of voltag and were more robust against fault such as loss of a leg make them strong candid for real-world applic .
