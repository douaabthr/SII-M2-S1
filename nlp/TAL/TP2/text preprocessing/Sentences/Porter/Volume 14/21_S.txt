assess of electromyogram use genet algorithm and artifici neural network
the record electr activ associ with muscl and nerv are call electromyogram emg and are use for examin of disord in the muscl and nerv system
the effici discrimin of normal and abnorm emg signal play vital role in the autom diagnost assist tool
henc the proper extract of featur subset select of best featur subset and develop of classifi model were essenti to differenti the abnorm and normal signal
in thi paper a total of 80 time frequenc featur of normal myopathi and amyotroph later sclerosi al emg signal were extric use four differ transform approach name stockwel synchro-extract wigner vill and short-tim fourier transform
the select of 15 signific featur wa perform use genet algorithm ga
also the statist signific of the select featur were analyz use three differ classif model of normal myopathi al case
further the artifici neural network ann classifi were develop individu for extract transform time frequenc featur and ga select featur
result demonstr that the select featur by genet algorithm are effici for the design of emg classifi .
