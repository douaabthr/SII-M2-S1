autom soil predict use bag-of-featur and chaotic spider monkey optim algorithm
a proper soil predict is one of the most import paramet to decid the suitabl crop which is gener perform manual by the farmer
therefor the effici of the farmer may be increas by produc an autom tool for soil predict
thi paper present an autom system for categor of the soil dataset into respect categori use imag of the soil which can further be use for the decis of crop
for the same a novel bag-of-word and chaotic spider monkey optim base method ha been propos which is use to classifi the soil imag into it respect categori
the novel chaotic spider monkey optim algorithm show desir converg and improv global search abil over standard benchmark function
henc it ha been use to cluster the keypoint in bag-of-word method for soil predict
the experiment outcom illustr that the anticip method effect classifi the soil in comparison to other meta-heurist base method .
