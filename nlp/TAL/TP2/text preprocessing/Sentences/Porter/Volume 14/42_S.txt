an effici system model to minim signal interfer and delay in mobil cloud environ
the integr of mobil comput with cloud comput ha increas advantag to the user to access the applic from anywher at ani time
the tradit cellular system is overlaid by number of low power node which allow user to attain servic at ani time
but the increas of femto cell caus intra-ti inter-ti interfer and delay in the network
to overcom the bottleneck a sub-modular optim base offload algorithm is propos in thi paper where the task is divid into two function and process
the main aim is to optim execut time and interfer
the simul result show that the execut time ha been reduc by 57.89% and perform well to obtain optimum solut compar to other exist method .
