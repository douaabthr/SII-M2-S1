hybrid ant lion with whale optim algorithm for compress sens mr imag reconstruct vial1minim an alwoa strategi
in the field of imag compress the compress sens imag reconstruct ha made great achiev due to proper use of the imag sparsiti without the nyquist sampl law constraint
for imag inform distribut great deal of research indic that there exist obviou structur and statist prior s regular and by the tradit compress algorithm it is difficult to achiev
in thi paper we propos a compress sens imag reconstruct algorithm base on hybrid alwoa strategi which combin the ant lion optim algorithm and the whale optim algorithm
the hybrid algorithm produc a global search with faster converg
by continu learn the propos hybrid method can find optim solut
the object function for the imag reconstruct process is taken as thel1minim problem
the reconstruct imag is obtain by solv thel1minim problem
extens simul have been conduct and the result show that the propos method ha achiev better perform when compar with tradit reconstruct algorithm .
