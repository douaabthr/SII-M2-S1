a group evalu base binari pso algorithm for featur select in high dimension data
thi paper propos a group evolut base featur select techniqu use binari pso which is an essenti tool of pre-process for solv classif problem
a new updat mechan for calcul pbest and gbest are also propos and the relev and redund of the select featur subset are consid as an object function
the propos algorithm is test and compar with four exist featur select algorithm
in thi studi a decis tree classifi is employ to evalu the classif accuraci of the select featur subset on five benchmark dataset
the result show that propos algorithm can be success use to improv classif accuraci and to improv stabil indic as well
it is also observ that with increas weight on relev of the function there is a signific reduct on the cardin of featur and increas in classif accuraci
the exist four algorithm usual select a smaller featur subset while the propos algorithm can achiev higher classif accuraci on most of the test dataset .
