a new pareto multi-object sine cosin algorithm for perform enhanc of radial distribut network by optim alloc of distribut gener
the integr of distribut gener dg is consid to be one of the best cost-effect techniqu to improv the effici of power distribut system in the recent deregul caus by continu load demand and transmiss system conting
in thi perspect a new multi-object sine cosin algorithm is propos for optim dg alloc in radial distribut system with minim of total activ power loss maxim of voltag stabil index minim of annual energi loss cost as well as pollut ga emiss without violat the system and dg oper constraint
the propos algorithm is enhanc by incorpor exponenti variat of the convers paramet and the self-adapt levi mutat to increas it perform dure differ iter phase
the contradictori relationship among the object motiv the author to gener an optim pareto set in order to help the network oper in take fast appropri decis
the propos approach is success appli to 33 bu and 69 bu distribut system under four practic load condit and is evalu in differ two-object and three-object optim case
the effect of the algorithm is confirm by compar the result against other well-known multi-object algorithm name strength pareto evolutionari algorithm 2 non-domin sort genet algorithm ii and multi-object particl swarm optim
the qualiti of pareto front from differ multi-object algorithm is compar in term of certain perform indic such as gener distanc space metric and spread metric vardelta and it statist signific is verifi by perform wilcoxon sign rank test .
