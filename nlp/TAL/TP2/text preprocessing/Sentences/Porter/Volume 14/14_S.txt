multi-ag path plan with nonlinear restrict
thi paper present a novel simplifi mathemat model that can solv a path plan problem compris three agent in a triangular format
the problem is model to optim the trajectori of the agent and to minim the distanc travel
the trajectori are obtain in a way that deviat them from fix obstacl whose dimens are known
furthermor geometri and orient constraint of the format of the multi-ag are impos
heurist method such as the genet algorithm differenti evolut and particl swarm optim are appli to solv the non-linear algebra equat which repres the system
comparison are present among the result of the differ method highlight the process time and the converg to the global minimum solut
the result prove that all the algorithm can be appli to the path plan problem with constraint
the particl swarm optim method present the lowest process time for all simul case
howev the differenti evolut method is more robust than the other when search for the global minimum solut .
