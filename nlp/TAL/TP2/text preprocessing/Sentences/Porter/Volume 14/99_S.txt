stochast gradient-caviar-bas deep belief network for text categor
text categor is defin as the process of assign tag to text accord to it content
some of the text classif approach are document organ spam email filter and news group
thi paper introduc stochast gradient-caviar-bas deep belief network for text categor
the overal procedur of the propos approach involv four step such as pre-process featur extract featur select and text categor
at first the pre-process is carri out from the input data base on stem stop-word remov and then the featur extract is perform use a vector space model
onc the extract is done the featur select is carri out base on entropi
subsequ the select featur are given to the text categor step
here the text categor is done use the propos sg-cav-bas deep belief network sg-cav-bas dbn
the propos sg-cav is use to train the dbn which is design by combin condit autoregress valu at risk and stochast gradient descent
the perform of the propos sgcav dbn is evalu base on the metric such as recal precis f-measur and accuraci
also the perform of the propos method is compar with the exist method such as naiv bay k-nearest neighbour support vector machin and deep belief network dbn
from the analysi it is depict that the propos sgcav dbn method achiev the maxim precis of 0.78 the maxim recal of 0.78 maxim f-measur of 0.78 and the maxim accuraci of 0.95
among the exist method dbn achiev the maximum precis recal f-measur and accuraci for 20 newsgroup databas and reuter databas
the perform of the propos system is 10.98% 11.54% 11.538% and 18.33% higher than the precis recal f-measur and accuraci of the dbn for 20 newsgroup databas and 2.38% 2.38% 2.37% and 0.21% higher than the precis recal f-measur and accuraci of the dbn for reuter databas .
