multi-object three level parallel pso algorithm for structur align of complex rna sequenc
thi paper introduc a cach enabl parallel multi-object tri-level particl swarm optim algorithm mo-3 lppso with object to address a challeng np-hard problem from bioinformat i. e
structur align of complex rna sequenc
mo-3 lppso implement master-slav topolog base commun strategi on the paral connect machin via messag pass interfac mpi
level 1 of the propos algorithm acquir the optim align of the sequenc distribut on slave processor in the order of their complex
further the align sequenc along with their align score are store on the master processor
in the second level the secondari structur of all thegbestalign sequenc of level 1 is obtain
each sequenc set is distribut on a slave processor that construct secondari structur of all sequenc from the set
the align score and secondari structur score obtain from level 1 and level 2 now move toward level 3 form a bi-object optim problem with the object to maxim sequenc similar score and minim free energi score for most stabl rna secondari structur
the top-level non-domin solut are extract further in level three and the extern archiv in ctrie is updat
the improv from mo-tlpso to mo-3 lppso ha been remark in the sens inclus of ctrie enabl the algorithm to work with multi-cli environ for handl rna structur align queri implement of parallel facilit structur align of highli complex massiv dataset of rna sequenc
further the differ between the time taken by mo-tlpso and mo-3 lppso is found extrem signific as confirm by non-parametr statist test mann-whitney u test
further the structur align of highli complex sequenc set is perform by mo-3 lppso which is test for predict accuraci and process time
the algorithm is found produc highli accur result at significantli lesser process time .
