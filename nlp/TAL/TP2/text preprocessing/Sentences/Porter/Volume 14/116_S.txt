numer solut of bagley torvik equat use legendr artifici neural network method
in thi articl we have use the legendr artifici neural network to find the solut of the bagley torvik equat which is a fractional-ord ordinari differenti equat
caputo fraction deriv ha been consid throughout the present work to handl the fraction order differenti equat
the train of optim weight of the network ha been carri out use a simul anneal optim techniqu
here we have present three exampl to exhibit the precis and relev of the propos techniqu with comparison to the other numer method with error analysi
the propos techniqu is an easi highli effici and robust techniqu for find the approxim solut of fractional-ord ordinari differenti equat .
