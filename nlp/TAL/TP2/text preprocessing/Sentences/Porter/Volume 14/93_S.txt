a deep contract autoencod for solv multiclass classif problem
contract auto encod cae is on of the most robust variant of standard auto encod ae
the major drawback associ with the convent cae is it higher reconstruct error dure encod and decod process of input featur to the network
thi drawback in the oper procedur of cae lead to it incap of go into finer detail present in the input featur by miss the inform worth consider
resultantli the featur extract by cae lack the true represent of all the input featur and the classifi fail in solv classif problem effici
in thi work an improv variant of cae is propos base on layer architectur follow feed forward mechan name as deep cae
in the propos architectur the normal cae are arrang in layer and insid each layer the process of encod and decod take place
the featur obtain from the previou cae are given as input to the next cae
each cae in all layer are respons for reduc the reconstruct error thu result in obtain the inform featur
the featur set obtain from the last cae is given as input to the softmax classifi for classif
the perform and effici of the propos model ha been test on five mnist variant-dataset
the result have been compar with standard sae dae rbm scae scatnet and pcanet in term of train error test error and execut time
the result reveal that the propos model outperform the aforement model .
