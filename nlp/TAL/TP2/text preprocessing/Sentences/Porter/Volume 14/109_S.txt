an extens experiment evalu of autom machin learn method for recommend classif algorithm
thi paper present an experiment comparison among four autom machin learn automl method for recommend the best classif algorithm for a given input dataset
three of these method are base on evolutionari algorithm ea and the other is auto-weka a well-known automl method base on the combin algorithm select and hyper-paramet optimis cash approach
the ea-bas method build classif algorithm from a singl machin learn paradigm either decision-tre induct rule induct or bayesian network classif
auto-weka combin algorithm select and hyper-paramet optimis to recommend classif algorithm from multipl paradigm
we perform control experi where these four automl method were given the same runtim limit for differ valu of thi limit
in gener the differ in predict accuraci of the three best automl method wa not statist signific
howev the ea evolv decision-tre induct algorithm ha the advantag of produc algorithm that gener interpret classif model and that are more scalabl to larg dataset by comparison with mani algorithm from other learn paradigm that can be recommend by auto-weka
we also observ that auto-weka ha shown meta-overfit a form of overfit at the meta-learn level rather than at the base-learn level .
