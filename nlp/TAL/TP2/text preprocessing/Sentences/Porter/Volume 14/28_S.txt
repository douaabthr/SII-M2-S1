perform evalu of multilevel invert base hybrid activ filter use soft comput techniqu
in thi paper a multilevel invert base shunt hybrid activ filter is use which is compos of passiv filter and shunt activ filter use for enhanc the qualiti of power by reduc the total harmon distort below 5% as per ieee-519 standard and manag the reactiv power as well as correct the power factor
the object of thi paper is to advanc the power qualiti by reduc the harmon distort in the distribut line which are affect becaus of utilis non-linear load across the load end
for refer current gener and for control the switch signal convent pi control wa use with differ refer signal detect techniqu
but with the evolut of differ intellig approach made more advantag than the pi control
in thi paper two artifici intellig method i. e artifici neural network and adapt neuro-fuzzi interfer system anfi are appli
comparison of the result of the propos method is analys use matlab simulink tool
for refer current gener synchron refer frame theori is use and hysteresi current control techniqu is employ for gener the gate signal .
