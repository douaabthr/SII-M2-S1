dnav an algorithm base on dna-comput and vortex search algorithm for task schedul problem
in thi paper we present dnav algorithm for the gener job-shop schedul problem also known as flexibl jssp
jssp is an np-complet problem which mean there is probabl no determinist or exact algorithm that can find the optimum solut in polynomi time for arbitrari instanc of the problem unless p np
in the dna comput algorithm although the hardwar is not access in the futur we will have those comput that work base on biolog hardwar
their most import advantag over silicon-bas comput are their capac for data storag
dnav is an improv of the dna comput algorithm by use a metaheurist search algorithm call vortex search vs algorithm
the strong of dna comput is it parallel
in the unavail of dna comput the dnav reduc the time complex of dna comput by employ the vs algorithm
the effici of the dnav ha been test with standard test instanc of job-shop schedul problem
our implement result show that the dnav algorithm work effect even for larg scale instanc on current silicon-bas comput .
