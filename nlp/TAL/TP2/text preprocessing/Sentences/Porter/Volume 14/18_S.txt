mesh smooth of complex geometri use variat of cohort intellig algorithm
sever approach includ optim base method were develop for mesh qualiti improv use onli node movement keep intact the element connect
in thi research a socio-inspir optim approach refer to as cohort intellig ci wa investig for mesh smooth
minim of summat of condit number of all element wa the final aim
the geometr boundari of the object defin the surfac and edg constraint for movement of extern node
movement of intern node wa complet govern by variat of ci algorithm viz
roulett wheel follow best follow better alien and random select follow worst and follow itself
the approach wa demonstr with pentagon prism hexagon prism and hexagon prism with hole
the perform of follow best and roulett wheel variat of ci algorithm wa observ to be satisfactori as compar to other variat of the algorithm .
