improv gbest artifici bee coloni algorithm for the constraint optim problem
live be in natur are most intellig creation of natur as they evolv with time and tri to find optimum solut for each problem individu or collect
artifici bee coloni algorithm is natur inspir algorithm that mimic the swarm behaviour of honey bee and success solv variou optim problem
solut qualiti in artifici bee coloni depend on the step size dure posit updat
randomli decid step size alway ha high possibl of miss out the exact solut
it popular variant name gbest-guid artifici bee coloni algorithm tri to balanc it and accomplish effect for unconstrain optim problem but not satisfactori for the constrain optim problem
further in the gbest-guid artifici bee coloni individu which are go to updat their posit attract toward the current best solut in the swarm which sometim lead to prematur converg
to avoid such situat as well as to enhanc the effici of gbest-guid artifici bee coloni to solv the unconstrain continu optim problem an improv variant is propos here
the improv gbest-guid artifici bee coloni propos modif in the posit updat dure both the phase i. e
employ and onlook bee phase to introduc diversif in search space addit intensif of the identifi region
the perform of new algorithm is evalu for 21 benchmark optim problem
base on statist analys it is shown that the new variant is a viabl altern of gbest-guid artifici bee coloni for the constraint optim problem .
