random offset minim in low frequenc front-end amplifi use swarm intellig base techniqu
random offset in amplifi aris mainli due to random variat i. e
inher mismatch in transistor paramet and greatli impact it overal design specif especi in case of low frequenc applic
it must be minim for high precis in the amplifi s perform
a new approach for minim of random offset voltag in amplifi ha been propos through the use of swarm intellig base optim algorithm due to their deriv free natur and easi search mechan
the approach involv firstli model the random offset voltag due to mismatch between transistor paramet base on pelgrom s model and then minim the formul model subject to design constraint use swarm intellig base algorithm
two case studi are consid firstli a high swing fold cascod oper transconduct amplifi ota and secondli a recycl fold cascod rfc ota
compar analysi have been perform by record best worst and mean data for 2500 function evalu and also use statist analysi such as friedmann s test and mann whitney s u test
the result indic that the hybrid whale particl swarm optim hwpso algorithm outperform the other state of the art algorithm by give a minimum random offset voltag of 7.2 mv and 1.452 mv with a mean rank of 1.55 and 1.75 for the 1st and 2nd case studi respect
valid of hwpso result have been done by perform simul and mont carlo analysi for the two amplifi in cadenc virtuoso which are found to be in close agreement with the algorithm result .
