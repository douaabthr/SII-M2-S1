intrus detect system for cloud forens use bayesian fuzzi cluster and optim base svnn
intrus detect ha emerg as one of the major challeng involv in the cloud forens
thi work introduc an intrus detect framework for the cloud environ with cluster and two-level classifi
in the first step of the process a bayesian fuzzi cluster is use for cluster the node in the cloud
and in the next step two-level gravit group search-bas support vector neural network gg-svnn classifi identifi intrus in cluster
gg-svnn is a novel optim scheme propos in thi work by combin the group search optim and gravit search algorithm
the intrus inform provid by level 1 classifi is arrang to form compact data and provid to the level 2 classifi
the level 2 classifi final identifi total node affect by the intrud
the simul of the propos intrus detect is done with the help of kdd cup dataset
from the simul result it is evid that the propos gg-svnn classifi ha achiev overal best perform by achiev high accuraci valu of 92.41% and low fals alarm rate of 4.75% respect .
