imag compress use explor bat algorithm by renyi 2 d histogram base on multilevel threshold
the main object of the imag compress is to extract meaning cluster from a given imag
a meaning cluster is possibl with perfect threshold valu which are optim by assum renyi entropi as an object function
due to the equal distribut of energi over the entir 1 d histogram it is comput complex
in order to improv the visual qualiti of a reconstruct imag a 2 d histogram base multilevel threshold is propos to maxim the renyi entropi use explor bat algorithm
thu procur result are compar with other optim techniqu and these are incorpor
it is the first time incorpor a weight peak signal to nois ratio wpsnr and the visual psnr vpsnr in the propos method becaus of the failur in measur the visual qualiti of peak signal to nois ratio psnr
experiment result are examin on a standard set of imag which are observ precis and effici in the multilevel threshold problem .
