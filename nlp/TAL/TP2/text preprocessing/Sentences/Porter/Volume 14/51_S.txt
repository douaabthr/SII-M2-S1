predict bipolar disord and schizophrenia base on non-overlap genet phenotyp use deep neural network
comput psychiatri is an emerg field of scienc
it focus on identifi the complex relationship between the brain s neurobiolog
mental ill ha recent becom an import problem to be address as the number of peopl affect is increas over time
schizophrenia and bipolar disord are two major type of psychiatr disord
most of the peopl are experienc these ill in their lifetim
but diagnos psychiatr disord is even more a complex problem
genet factor play a vital role in develop mental ill
interestingli few psychiatr disord have common genet overlap between each other
it caus detriment effect on diagnos the ill accur
to overcom thi exist issu a rank base gene biomark identif and classif framework is propos to identifi the overlap and non-overlap gene pattern of bipolar disord and schizophrenia
the dataset use in thi experi is obtain from gene express omnibu databas
as an outcom of thi experi seven biomark are identifi as the overlap gene
also 60 and 68 inform gene biomark are identifi on bipolar disord and schizophrenia dataset as featur subset to discrimin the sampl
overlap gene are elimin to increas the diagnost accuraci of the disord
the perform of the propos system is evalu with standard exist machin learn algorithm
thi propos framework attain 97.01% and 95.65% accuraci on bipolar disord and schizophrenia dataset with deep neural network model outperform other benchmark algorithm and prove it efficaci .
