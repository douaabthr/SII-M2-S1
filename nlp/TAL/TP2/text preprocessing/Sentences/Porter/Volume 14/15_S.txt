evolutionari intellig techniqu for human comput
evolutionari intellig serv as a power tool to mimic and process human knowledg and therebi act as a veri pertin compon in develop intellig system
a plethora of intellig comput approach are in use to optim multidisciplinari engin applic
it is known that hybrid of comput approach with tradit engin methodolog and applic ha becom a topic of increas interest for both research and develop global from academia as well as industri
thi special issu ha brought out a wide spectrum of applic of ei techniqu in variou field of applic
over 80 research articl are includ in thi special issu that address the advanc in theori concept mathemat as well as physic and methodolog of evolutionari comput natur inspir algorithm artifici intellig soft comput and machin learn where they could be appli to numer interdisciplinari domain of engin as well as bio-med for aid to human conveni
reader can be immens benefit by the wide spectrum of coverag of the topic in thi special issu pertain to evolutionari intellig and it applic
we are confid the topic shall be use for research and will motiv them to further dive deep into the evolutionari intellig concept method algorithm and will appli them to their own field of applic .
