chaotic multi vers optim base fuzzi logic control for frequenc control of microgrid
thi paper repres an arrang of fuzzi pd and deriv filter base pid control fpidf with it optim design membership function and is employ for the load frequenc control lfc of isol multi microgrid
the perform of a recent develop multi vers optim mvo algorithm is improv by introduc chaotic map appropri in the algorithm
the improv algorithm name as cmvo algorithm is appli to tune the proport integr deriv pid control gain for the lfc of microgrid
the superior of the propos cmvo algorithm is examin by it superior perform compar to mvo pid recent publish iaya pid jaya pid and ga pid in the microgrid system
further cmvo base fpidf with it optim membership posit fpidf-om outperform compar to cmvo base fpidf ijaya tune fpid and fpd/pi-pd control in microgrid system
better dynam perform are found with the propos techniqu for stochast type wind power solar irradi and load variat in the microgrid compar with fpidf and pid
the robust of the propos techniqu is establish by the sensit analysi
the propos design approach ha been extend to a microgrid model includ bioga turbin gener biodiesel engin gener and aqua electrolys along with fuel cell unit
final opal-rt base hardware-in-the-loop simul of propos techniqu ha been done .
