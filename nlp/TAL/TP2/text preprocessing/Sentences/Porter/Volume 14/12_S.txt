on the cryptanalysi of s-de use natur inspir optim algorithm
cryptanalysi ha emerg to be an import topic in the era of modern emerg technolog
the cryptanalysi of simplifi data encrypt standard s-de is a np-hard combinatori problem
thi paper ha two goal
firstli we studi the cryptanalysi of s-de via nature-inspir meta-heurist algorithm name cuckoo search firefli and black-hol optim algorithm
each of these algorithm is base on fascin natur phenomena and exploit the inher uniqu of such phenomena to solv optim problem
secondli we present a compar studi on the effici of these three fairli new algorithm with that of previous establish memet algorithm and genet algorithm in regard to s-de cryptanalysi
through experiment and extens test it ha been shown that the propos algorithm base on cuckoo search prove to be most effici with respect to accuraci and execut time .
