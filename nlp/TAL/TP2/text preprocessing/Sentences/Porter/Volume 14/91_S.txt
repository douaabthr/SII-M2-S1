distributed-elit local search base on a genet algorithm for bi-object job-shop schedul under time-of-us tariff
the rapid growth of electr demand ha led govern around the world to implement energy-consci polici such as time-of-us tariff
the manufactur sector can embrac these polici by implement an innov schedul system to reduc it energi consumpt
therefor thi studi address bi-object job-shop schedul with total weight tardi and electr cost minim under time-of-us tariff
the problem can be decompos into two sub-problem oper sequenc and start time determin
to solv thi problem we propos a distributed-elit local search base on a genet algorithm that use local improv strategi base on the distribut of elit
specif chromosom encod use two line of gene represent correspond to the oper sequenc and start time
we propos a decod method to obtain a schedul that incorpor oper sequenc and start time
a perturb scheme to reduc electr cost wa develop
final a local search framework base on the distribut of elit is use to guid the select of individu and the determin of perturb
comprehens numer experi use benchmark data from the literatur demonstr that the propos method is more effect than nsga-ii moea/d and spea2
the result present in thi work may be use for the manufactur sector to adopt the time-of-us tariff polici .
