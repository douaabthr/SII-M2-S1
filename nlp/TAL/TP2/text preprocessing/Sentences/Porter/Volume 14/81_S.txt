neuromodul multiobject evolutionari neurocontrol without speciat
neuromodul is a biologically-inspir techniqu that can adapt the per-connect learn rate of synapt plastic
neuromodul ha been use to facilit unsupervis learn by adapt neural network weight
multiobject evolut of neural network topolog and weight ha been use to design neurocontrol for autonom robot
thi paper present a novel multiobject evolutionari neurocontrol with unsupervis learn for robot navig
multiobject evolut of network weight and topolog neat-mod is augment with neuromodul learn
neat-mod is an nsga-ii base multiobject neurocontrol that use two conflict object
the first reward the robot when it move in a direct manner with minim turn the second object is to reach as mani target as possibl
neat-mod use speciat a select process that aim to ensur pareto-optim genotyp divers and elit
the effect of the design is demonstr use a seri of experi with a simul robot travers a simpl maze contain target goal
it is shown that when neuromodul learn is combin with multiobject evolut better-perform neural control are synthes than by evolut alon
secondli it is demonstr that speciat is unnecessari in neuromodul neuroevolut as neuromodul preserv topolog innov
the propos neuromodul approach is found to be statist superior to neat-mod alon when appli to solv a multiobject navig problem .
