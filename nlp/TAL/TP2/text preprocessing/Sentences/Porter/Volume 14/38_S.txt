thick optim of high temperatur protect cloth
aim at the goal of protect the person safeti of high temperatur worker and reduc the cost of r d in enterpris the articl put forward the optim of the thick of high temperatur protect cloth
a one-dimension unsteadi heat conduct model is construct by combin the heat conduct equat with the definit solut condit establish by the initi state and boundari state to repres the temperatur conduct process of the extern high temperatur protect cloth human epidermi system
the finit differ method is use to find the numer solut of the heat conduct equat to repres the temperatur distribut in the system
in thi paper an optim algorithm base on control variabl method and dichotomi method is design to obtain the optim solut of double-lay thick of high temperatur protect cloth
final through simul experi the practic problem are analyz by use the propos model and algorithm .
