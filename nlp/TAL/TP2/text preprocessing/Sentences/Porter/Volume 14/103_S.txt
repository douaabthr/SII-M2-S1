dimension reduct of hyperspectr imag use signal entropi and spatial inform in genet algorithm with discret wavelet transform
band select is be perform in hyperspectr imageri as a dimension reduct measur to enhanc the effici of process and analysi of the data
in thi paper a genet algorithm base method is propos that use weight combin of signal entropi and imag spatial inform in the object function
the spatial dimens that also includ huge redund ha been reduc use discret wavelet transform to make the method more time effici without compromis the qualiti of the output
the perform of the method is evalu by classifi the hyperspectr imag with select band and measur the accuraci of the classifi output
the propos method is also compar with other state of the art method and found to be more effici in select inform rich band in the hyperspectr data .
