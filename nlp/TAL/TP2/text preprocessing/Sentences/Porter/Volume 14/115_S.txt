improv chaotic binari grey wolf optim algorithm for workflow schedul in green cloud comput
the workflow schedul in the cloud comput environ is a well-known np-complet problem and metaheurist algorithm are success adapt to solv thi problem more effici
grey wolf optim gwo is a recent propos interest metaheurist algorithm to deal with continu optim problem
in thi paper we propos igwo an improv version of the gwo algorithm which use the hill-climb method and chao theori to achiev better result
the propos algorithm can increas the converg speed of the gwo and prevent fall into the local optimum
afterward a binari version of the propos igwo algorithm use variou s function and v function is introduc to deal with the workflow schedul problem in cloud comput data center aim to minim their execut cost makespan and the power consumpt
the propos workflow schedul scheme is simul use the cloudsim simul and the result show that our scheme can outperform other schedul approach in term of metric such as power consumpt cost and makespan .
