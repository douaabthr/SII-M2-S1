novel oper for quantum evolutionari algorithm in solv timet problem
timet is a well-known combinatori optim problem which belong to the class of np hard problem
quantum evolutionari algorithm qea are highli suitabl for the class of combinatori optim problem but sinc propos they have not been use in solv thi problem
in thi paper we develop new oper for qea to improv it perform in solv timet problem
the first oper we develop is a reiniti oper which check the popul and when it is converg reiniti it to maintain the divers
the other oper is call the divers preserv oper which monitor the q-individu and if it find more than one q-individu search around the same local optimum reiniti some of them to make sure differ q-individu are exploit differ region in the search space
in thi paper we also studi the popul size and the popul structur of qea in solv timet problem
in order to test the propos algorithm we perform experi and compar the propos algorithm to the exist algorithm on some well-known benchmark function .
