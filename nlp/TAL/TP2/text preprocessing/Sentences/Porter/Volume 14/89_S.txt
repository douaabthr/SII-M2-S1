genet algorithm-bas fuzzi cluster appli to multivari time seri
despit the fact that the fuzzi cluster of time seri base on genet algorithm ga is mostli use in applic involv univari time seri thi paper present an approach base on ga and fuzzi c-mean fcm for cluster multivari time seri
each chromosom is an individu or solut which encod the cluster centroid pattern and a bi-criterion constrain cluster is propos to maxim both the similar of object in the same cluster base on the spca metric and the distanc between the center of the cluster
the propos method is appli in two case studi involv a real industri case which compris pattern recognit for detect oper failur in a ga turbin and a well-known benchmark industri system tennesse eastman process use to evalu techniqu for detect and diagnos failur
the propos approach wa abl to obtain better classif result compar to fcm base on classic optim method .
