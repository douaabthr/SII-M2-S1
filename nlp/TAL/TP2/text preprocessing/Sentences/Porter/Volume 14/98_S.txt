dna motif discoveri use chemic reaction optim
dna motif discoveri mean to find short similar sequenc element within a set of nucleotid sequenc
it ha becom a compulsori need in bioinformat for it use applic such as compress summar and cluster algorithm
motif discoveri is an np-hard problem and exact algorithm cannot solv it in polynomi time
mani optim algorithm were propos to solv thi problem
howev none of them can show it supremaci by overcom all the obstacl
chemic reaction optim cro is a popul base metaheurist algorithm that can easili fit for the optim problem
here we have propos an algorithm base on chemic reaction optim techniqu to solv the dna motif discoveri problem
the four basic oper of cro have been redesign for thi problem to search the solut space local as well as global
two addit oper repair function have been propos to improv the qualiti of the solut
they have been appli to the final solut after the iter stage of cro to get a better one
use the flexibl mechan of elementari oper of cro along with the addit oper repair function it is possibl to determin motif more precis
our propos method is compar with other tradit algorithm such as gibb sampler alignac align nucleic acid conserv element meme multipl expect maxim for motif elicit and acri ant-colony-regulatory-identif by test real-world dataset
the experiment result show that the propos algorithm can give better result than other tradit algorithm in qualiti and in less run time
besid statist test have been perform to show the superior of the propos algorithm over other state-of-the-art in thi area .
