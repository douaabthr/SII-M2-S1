mcdfn suppli chain demand forecast via an explain multi-channel data fusion network model
accur demand forecast is vital for optim suppli chain manag and enhanc organiz resili
tradit forecast method reli on simpl arithmet often fail to captur complex pattern caus by season variabl and special event
although deep learn techniqu have advanc the lack of interpret model hamper understand and explain predict
we introduc the multi-channel data fusion network mcdfn a novel hybrid deep learn architectur integr multipl data modal for superior demand forecast
mcdfn util convolut neural network cnn long short-term memori network lstm and gate recurr unit gru to extract spatial and tempor featur from time seri data
compar benchmark against seven other deep-learn model valid mcdfn s efficaci show it outperform it counterpart across key metric with a mean squar error mse of 23.5738 root mean squar error rmse of 4.8553 mean absolut error mae of 3.9991 and mean absolut percentag error mape of 20.1575%
theil s u statist of 0.1181 u 1 of mcdfn indic it superior over the naiv forecast approach and a 10 fold cross-valid statist pairedt-test with ap-valu of 5% indic no signific differ between mcdfn s predict and actual valu
to address the black box natur of mcdfn we employ explain ai techniqu such as shaptim and permut featur import offer insight into model decision-mak process
thi research advanc demand forecast methodolog and provid practic guidelin for integr mcdfn into exist suppli chain system .
