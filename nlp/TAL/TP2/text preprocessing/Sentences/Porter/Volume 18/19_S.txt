fast implement of extrem learn machine-bas directrank for surrogate-assist evolutionari algorithm
surrogate-assist evolutionari algorithm saea have been wide use to solv comput expens optim problem
the extrem learn machine-bas directrank eldr is a single-lay feed-forward neural network surrog model design for saea
eldr estim the superior of two solut with a high estim accuraci even in high-dimension problem
howev eldr requir a long comput time as the problem dimension and the number of hidden neuron increas thu make it difficult to appli it to high-dimension problem
a surrog model should be comput effici and enabl rapid fit estim
therefor thi paper propos a fast implement techniqu i.e. fast version eldr feldr that achiev mathemat equival learn result with low comput complex
addit thi paper propos a pointwis score function to render the predict result reusabl
the experiment result confirm the effect of feldr when compar with the origin eldr
the learn result of the propos feldr were equival to those of the origin eldr while reduc the train time by up to 97% especi when use a larg hidden layer on a high dimension problem
moreov due to the reusabl predict result the comput time of the feldr-assist saea can be further decreas by 79.5% when compar with that of the origin eldr-assist saea
the reduc train time and reusabl predict result of feldr render it feasibl to appli eldr to high-dimension optim problem and realiz a high predict accuraci with a larg number of hidden neuron .
