enhanc secretari bird optim algorithm for enhanc dg deploy and reconfigur in electr distribut network to improv power system effici
optim distribut gener dg placement and network restructur in radial distribut system can significantli enhanc technic accomplish and effect in oper
thi studi introduc a hybrid secretari bird optim hsbo algorithm an enhanc version of the origin sbo specif design to address the challeng of multi-dimension and complex optim problem in such system
the hsbo incorpor cauchi mutat for improv explor and opposition-bas learn to ensur a divers and repres initi popul
the optim techniqu aim to minim a multi-object function that consid activ and reactiv power loss and voltag deviat
the propos algorithm is test on 85 node 141 node and 415 node system and compar with state-of-the-art optim techniqu includ the origin sbo golden jackal optim and particl swarm optim
assess of perform are carri out under differ voltage-depend load model includ constant power constant current constant imped and composit load
addit a cost benefit analysi assess the econom benefit through quantifi the reduct in econom loss achiev through appropri dg deploy and network reconfigur
result demonstr the hsbo s superior perform in integr dg unit with optim power factor and perform network reconfigur
for the 85 node network activ power loss is reduc by 97.49% reactiv power loss by 98.14% and voltag deviat by 98.86%
in the 141 node system activ power loss is reduc by 95.11% reactiv power loss by 95.44% and voltag deviat by 87.02%
in the 415 node network activ power loss is reduc by 80.92% reactiv power loss by 79.77% and voltag deviat by 76% .
