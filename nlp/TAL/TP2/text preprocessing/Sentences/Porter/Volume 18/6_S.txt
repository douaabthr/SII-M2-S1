deep reinforc learning-bas spatio-tempor graph neural network for solv job shop schedul problem
the job shop schedul problem jssp is a well-known np-hard combinatori optim problem that focus on assign task to limit resourc while adher to certain constraint
current deep reinforc learn drl base solut are be wide use to solv the jssp by defin the problem structur on disjunct graph
some of the propos approach attempt to leverag the structur inform of the jssp to captur the dynam of the environ without consid the time depend within the jssp
howev learn graph represent onli from the structur relationship of node result in a weak and incomplet represent of these graph which doe not provid an express represent of the dynam in the environ
in thi studi unlik exist framework we defin the jssp as a dynam graph to explicitli consid the time-vari aspect of the jssp environ
to thi end we propos a novel drl framework that captur both the spatial and tempor attribut of the jssp to construct rich and complet graph represent
our drl framework introduc a novel attent graph isomorph network attentive-gin base spatial block to learn the structur relationship and a tempor block to captur the time depend
addit we design a gate fusion block that select combin the learn represent from the two block
we train the model use the proxim polici optim algorithm of reinforc learn
experiment result show that our train model exhibit signific perform enhanc compar to heurist dispatch rule and learning-bas solut for both randomli gener dataset and public benchmark .
