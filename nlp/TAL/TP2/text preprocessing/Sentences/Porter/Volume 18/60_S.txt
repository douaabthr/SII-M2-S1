solv the capacit facil locat problem with servic distanc and outsourc use a custom artifici bee coloni algorithm
thi articl consid a variant of the capacit facil locat problem where each custom ha a non-neg demand and each facil ha a non-neg capac limit and a servic distanc beyond which it cannot serv custom
a fix number of facil are open from potenti locat
the open facil can onli provid servic to the custom incur servic cost
due to the capac limit and servic distanc of facil all the custom may not be servic by the open facil and these custom can be outsourc incur outsourc cost
each custom ha it own non-neg outsourc cost
the goal is to minim the sum of servic and outsourc cost
thi problem is term the capacit facil locat problem with servic distanc and outsourc cflpsdo
a 0-1 integ linear program formul for cflpsdo is present in thi articl
for experiment 45 instanc are gener from real-world maxim cover locat problem instanc
these are solv use the exact solver cplex to creat benchmark solut
then a custom artifici bee coloni abc algorithm-bas metaheurist with two oper for enhanc search space explor and exploit is employ and found to produc optim solut effici .
