assess of uncertainti in stock exchang market use pythagorean hesit fuzzi sugeno weber aggreg oper
uncertainti and fuzzi are involv in almost all aspect of life
multi-attribut decision-mak is the most suitabl techniqu for identifi the optim altern from uncertain and fuzzi inform therebi reduc ambigu in practic applic
n the modern age busi ha shift from a physic to an onlin mode exemplifi by stack exchang
howev it is too technic for new businesspeopl to find the right invest opportun in the stock exchang market
for handl such type of problem the pythagorean hesit fuzzi set framework is an advanc and flexibl assess tool
the sugeno weber t-norm and sugeno weber t-conorm oper provid a flexibl environ for data aggreg
the thought is that the pythagorean hesit fuzzi set is a more flexibl and advanc structur than the simpl one due to the hesit degre
by motiv the concept of pythagorean hesit fuzzi set and sugeno weber oper we develop a famili of aggreg oper call pythagorean hesit fuzzi sugeno weber weight averag and pythagorean hesit fuzzi sugeno weber weight geometr oper
addit we examin some fundament axiom of aggreg oper includ bounded monoton and idempot to verifi the authent and accuraci of the propos theori
to construct a multi-attribut decision-mak algorithm base on the develop theori
we offer a solut to real-lif multi-attribut decision-mak madm problem involv money invest in the stock exchang market through our diagnost approach
compar with exist methodolog we investig the applic of pythagorean hesit fuzzi sugeno weber weight averag and pythagorean hesit fuzzi sugeno weber weight geometr oper
solid conclus are discuss in the last section .
