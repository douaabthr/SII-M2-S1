a new ant stridulation-bas local search for combinatori optim problem
stridul insect like ant use acoust commun as a crucial part of their social behavior allow them to coordin their activ and respond to chang environment condit
thi paper introduc a novel local search-bas approach inspir by the acoust commun in real ant coloni
despit the larg number of exist bio-inspir metaheurist no singl algorithm is univers optim and a new approach inspir by ant sound commun could offer advantag in specif problem
sound-bas mechan could provid better way to balanc explor and exploit potenti improv search effici
in the propos approach artifici ant employ a 2 opt local search guid by acoust signal to enhanc the qualiti of a popul of initi solut
to assess the efficaci of the propos approach experi are conduct on variou benchmark instanc of the travel salesman problem
experiment result demonstr promis perform outperform or match state-of-the-art algorithm on sever benchmark instanc .
