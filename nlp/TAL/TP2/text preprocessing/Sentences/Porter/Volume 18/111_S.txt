a comprehens review of optim approach of district cool system
the integr of district cool technolog into smart energi network power by renew energi sourc present signific opportun for advanc decarbon of the cool sector and support progress toward global net-zero target
these system leverag advanc model and optim to evalu design configur oper strategi and cross-sector coupl while captur complex thermohydraul interact and spatiotempor variabl
thi review offer a comprehens synthesi of methodolog develop posit district cool system optim as a distinct and emerg research domain
thi studi underscor past achiev current trend and emerg opportun while identifi critic research gap and deploy challeng within optim framework
by examin both design and oper phase it offer focus insight into crucial area shape futur develop
the find highlight the pivot role of optim strategi in enhanc econom environment and technic perform deliv benefit such as cost reduct deep decarbon through renew integr and improv energi effici
despit notabl progress current methodolog remain limit in captur the escal complex of broader system model both under the emerg holist approach and multi-domain interact
the prevail bodi of literatur is larg character by fragment contribut that while demonstr specif advanc prove inadequ in foster unifi and scalabl approach
advanc the field will requir sustain interdisciplinari engag with particular emphasi on leverag artifici intellig ai base metaheurist to develop robust scalabl and practic applic collaborative-integrated-optim framework capabl of meet the evolv challeng of sustain district cool technolog within smart energi infrastructur and relat domain .
