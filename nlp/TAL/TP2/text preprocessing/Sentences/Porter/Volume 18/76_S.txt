smadasyn-boost cross-project transfer learn for effect secur fault predict
purpos security-rel softwar fault predict is essenti yet challeng due to limit label vulner data and the inconsist of fault pattern across softwar project
thi studi aim to improv the generaliz of fault predict model use a cross-project learn approach
method we propos a cross-project transfer learn framework for secur fault predict enhanc by featur distribut align techniqu includ kolmogorov smirnov ks test anderson darl test and pearson correl
to effect address the issu of class imbal preval in vulner dataset we introduc smadasyn a hybrid oversampl method that integr the strength of smote synthet minor oversampl techniqu and adasyn adapt synthet sampl
the propos approach is empir valid across six apach softwar project use a rang of classifi decis tree naiv bay logist regress and random forest along with ensembl method such as bag boost and stack
result experiment result demonstr that random forest consist achiev the highest perform particularli in term of f1-score and recal
statist valid use the friedman test and nemenyi post-hoc analysi confirm the signific and robust of the result across dataset
conclus the propos method effect enhanc secur fault predict in cross-project scenario
by combin featur align and advanc sampl techniqu the framework deliv accur and generaliz predict offer practic valu for softwar secur assur .
