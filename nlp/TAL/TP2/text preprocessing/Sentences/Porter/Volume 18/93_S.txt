pythagorean fuzzi similar measur with signific in mcdm and transport challeng
a potent extens of intuitionist fuzzi set that tackl ambigu and uncertainti at a higher level is the pythagorean fuzzi set mathbb p_yf
when assess the degre of similar between two fuzzi set the similar measur is a help tool
it is use in typic decision-mak scenario
in thi studi a new way to determin the degre of similar is present and contrast with previou method
all of the shortcom of the exist measur can be mitig by the newli suggest measur
the use of thi measur in use the modifi vlekriterijumsko kompromisno rangiranj vikor approach to handl decision-mak problem is illustr with a few instanc
addit relev exampl are provid to illustr how it could be use to challeng relat to transport
the suggest method accomplish the primari object of the transport problem which is reduc transport cost when compar to other option .
