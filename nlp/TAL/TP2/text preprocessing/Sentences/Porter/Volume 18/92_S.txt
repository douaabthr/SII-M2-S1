dendrit neuron model optim with mountain gazel optim for time-seri forecast
time-seri forecast predict and estim have been activ research topic in recent year due to their critic role in decision-mak and futur plan
artifici neural network ann are wide employ for forecast applic and have demonstr signific perform improv
in thi paper we util a special type of ann the dendrit neuron model dnm for time-seri forecast
we appli an optim dnm model by util the power of metaheurist mh optim algorithm
specif we employ an mh algorithm the mountain gazel optim mgo to optim the paramet of the dnm improv it configur process and ultim improv the accuraci of the forecast
furthermor we compar mgo perform with sever other optim algorithm use to optim the dnm model
comprehens evalu are conduct on four publicli avail time seri dataset use multipl evalu indic
the result demonstr the superior of the mgo-dnm model over compet method with optim dnm configur consist outperform the tradit dnm in forecast task .
