mycelium neural architectur search
thi paper propos mycelium-na a novel biolog inspir neural architectur search na approach base on mycelium network growth and adapt
thi novel approach formul na as an emerg growth process where architectur dynam evolv through adapt expans fusion and reorient of network compon mirror the organ explor of mycelium
in particular it introduc hyphal growth strategi branch fusion and orient as new oper for dynam construct neural architectur
a fitness-driven select process optim perform while penal excess paramet
evalu on imag classif task mycelium-na demonstr competit perform on cifar-10 cifar-100 and fashion-mnist dataset achiev a compel balanc between accuraci and paramet effici in comparison to establish architectur
our result highlight the potenti of biologically-inspir search strategi to address the critic challeng in na offer a resource-consci and adapt paradigm for autom neural network design .
