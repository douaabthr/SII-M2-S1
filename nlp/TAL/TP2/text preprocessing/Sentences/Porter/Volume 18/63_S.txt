present a novel hybrid method for dynam economic/emiss dispatch consid renew energi unit and energi storag system
the integr of renew energi sourc ress and energi storag es system into power grid ha introduc signific challeng particularli in term of econom and environment dispatch
the intermitt natur of ress and uncertainti relat to their output make it difficult for tradit dynam economic/emiss dispatch deed method to ensur optim power gener
the primari goal of deed problem is to effici manag the product of electr energi while satisfi variou oper and system constraint such as ramp rate rr limit and the valv point effect vpe
thi optim is achiev by minim both the overal fuel cost and emiss of power gener unit
to address these challeng thi paper propos a novel hybrid optim approach that incorpor demand respons program drp alongsid es and re to enhanc system flexibl
by leverag drp consum particip in shift or reduc their demand is consid lead to a more balanc and cost-effect dispatch strategi
the propos optim framework employ a hybrid method that combin particl swarm optim pso and modifi shuffl frog leap algorithm msfla to effect solv the deed problem
addit a fuzzy-bas approach is util to achiev a trade-off between econom and environment object ensur an optim balanc between fuel cost reduct and emiss minim
the effect of the propos methodolog is valid on a test system with 10 gener unit over a 24 h period
the numer result indic that compar to convent techniqu such as grasshopp optim go pso shuffl frog leap algorithm sfla and other method report in the literatur the propos strategi achiev significantli improv trade-off solut
the incorpor of drp further enhanc the adapt of the system by reduc peak demand and improv cost effici make it a practic and effect solut for real-world power system oper
specif the integr of drp led to a 5% decreas in fuel cost and a 4% declin in emiss compar to case without drp highlight it role in improv both econom effici and environment sustain within the deed framework
the result demonstr that hpso-msfla is a highli effect optim techniqu for the deed problem in modern power grid with high level of renew energi sourc and drp
when compar to tradit method like pso and sfla hpso-msfla consist deliv better perform .
