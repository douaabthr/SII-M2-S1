research on the risk assess of the green construct of hydraul tunnel base a on combin weighting-cloud model
base on the complex and signific green construct characterist of modern hydraul tunnel engin and the identifi risk thereof an index wa weight use a combin weight method improv analyt hierarchi process and entropi weight method
a cloud model for the green construct risk evalu of a hydraul tunnel wa construct base on cloud theori
after appli thi model to typic engin situat the digit featur of the cloud model and an evalu cloud map of each index were obtain
the investig show that in the green construct risk of hydraul tunnel the degre of green construct manag risk wa the highest risk uncertainti of environment pollut and damag risk wa the largest and construct resourc util risk wa the most unstabl
the comprehens cloud map reveal that the green construct risk of hydraul tunnel lay between grade i and ii small and minor risk respect be closer to grade ii
consid the evalu result techniqu were identifi to improv green construct plan and strengthen green construct manag train to reduc project green construct risk .
