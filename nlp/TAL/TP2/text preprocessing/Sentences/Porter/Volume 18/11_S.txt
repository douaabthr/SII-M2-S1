integr of metaheurist oper through unstructur evolut game theori approach a novel hybrid methodolog
thi paper introduc a novel approach to address the complex of current optim challeng by develop hybrid metaheurist algorithm
these algorithm combin the strength of differ strategi to enhanc solut identif and refin
in thi work the integr of metaheurist oper use the unstructur evolut game theori to regul and merg the advantag featur of the cheetah optim and particl swarm optim to solv continu optim problem is propos
the cheetah optim and particl swarm optim are chosen for their superior exploit and explor capabl respect
our methodolog unfold in two primari phase combin and modul
in the combin phase cheetah optim and particl swarm optim search strategi are merg creat a unifi popul that gener new candid solut posit base on the best solut and a modul factor
dure the modul phase pairwis competit base on unstructur evolut game theori assess candid solut against the object function adjust their modul factor and posit accordingli
we conduct variou experi to evalu our approach against the origin cheetah optim and particl swarm optim as well as seven other well-known metaheurist algorithm and hybrid scheme across 30 benchmark function in dimens of 30 50 and 100
the result reveal that our hybrid scheme outperform the compar algorithm demonstr enhanc perform effect and robust through a detail converg and signific analysi .
