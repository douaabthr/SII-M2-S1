global optim through promethee-driven tri-point select base genet algorithm
to address the limit of convent select techniqu like roulett wheel select and stochast univers sampl su thi studi introduc the tri-point select tp oper an innov enhanc for genet algorithm ga
use cec 2017 benchmark function across differ dimens
the propos select scheme tp achiev optimum mean valu 35% outperform rw 15% ts 24% and su 25%
while the averag standard deviat of tp 39% is higher compar to rw 26% su 20% and ts 15% tp demonstr superior consist by achiev the least standard deviat in 33 out of 84 case
thi balanc between explor and stabil enabl tp to deliv a higher percentag of ideal result show it robust across divers optim scenario
promethe analysi further confirm tp s effect in maintain an optim balanc between explor and exploit lead to improv converg perform
thi advanc not onli refin ga select process but also open new avenu for tp s applic in solv complex optim challeng .
