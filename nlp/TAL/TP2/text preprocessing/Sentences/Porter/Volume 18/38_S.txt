analyz metaheurist algorithm perform and the caus of the zero-bia problem a differ perspect in benchmark
thi paper present an altern approach to evalu the explor capabl of metaheurist algorithm by analyz their perform on benchmark function
unlik convent method that focu on the precis of final solut the propos method evalu how often algorithm locat the region contain the global optimum
by defin a threshold fit valu that distinguish between global and local optima the studi provid a direct measur of explor success
eleven metaheurist algorithm were compar on multimod and shift benchmark function uncov signific differ in their explor effici
notabl a pervas flaw the zero-bia problem wa identifi in sever algorithm which artifici boost perform on certain benchmark while hinder real-world applic
thi paper propos fix for these issu and highlight standout perform with robust explor capabl
the find offer research a clearer understand of explor mechan and provid practic insight for design more effect optim algorithm .
