gaussian combin arm algorithm a novel meta-heurist approach for solv engin problem
thi studi present the gaussian combin arm gca algorithm a novel metaheurist approach inspir by militari strategi design to address high-dimension and complex optim challeng in engin
the algorithm employ a dual-ag strategi by divid search agent into two coordin group ground forc for intens refin solut within promis region and air forc for extens explor the search space to avoid local optima
by integr gaussian distribut principl the gca algorithm dynam balanc explor and exploit ensur adapt and effici across divers optim landscap
experiment evalu are first appli on three set of test function includ the standard benchmark set cec2017 and cec2019 follow by sever real-world engin problem such as econom load dispatch and structur design optim
the result demonstr that gca achiev superior accuraci robust and converg rate compar to convent metaheurist algorithm
these find underscor the potenti of gca as a reliabl tool for solv intric engin optim problem .
