capac predict model for lithium-ion batteri base on bi-direct lstm neural network optim by adapt converg factor gold rush optim
lithium-ion batteri play a crucial role in our daili live
accur predict the state of health soh and remain use life of lithium-ion batteri is essenti
to solv the limit in predict accuraci of tradit method a new approach is propos that use an adapt converg factor improv gold rush optim gro to optim a bi-direct long short-term memori bilstm neural network for predict lithium-ion batteri capac
sinc the capac degrad of lithium-ion batteri follow time seri pattern bilstm ha been chosen to solv thi issu effect
at the same time to enhanc the learn capabl of bilstm gro is use to optim the network s weight and bia paramet result in higher predict accuraci
in addit an adapt converg factor is propos to balanc gro s local and global search capabl
compar to other neural network such as feed-forward neural network fnn long short-term memori lstm neural network and bilstm as well as differ meta-heurist optim algorithm to optim bilstm like differenti evolut de harri hawk optim hho whale optim algorithm woa and great treval optim gto the experiment result show that the optim model perform better and predict batteri capac with increas accuraci .
