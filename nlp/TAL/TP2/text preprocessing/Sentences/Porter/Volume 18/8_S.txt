gaussian mixtur model and bayesian convolut neural network for abnorm musculoskelet radiograph classif
musculoskelet radiograph classif ha been gain great attent due to it import applic in autom diagnosi of musculoskelet disord
gener musculoskelet radiograph captur imag of variou bone in the whole bodi which can be consid as a combin of multipl singl dataset
exist work have tri to build either a tradit neural network nn convolut neural network cnn or bayesian convolut neural network bcnn to achiev effici classif
howev none of them explor the mixed-dataset properti
in thi context we propos a novel gaussian mixtur model-bas bcnn mixbcnn for the abnorm musculoskelet radiograph classif problem
in the propos method the distribut of nn weight is repres as a gaussian mixtur distribut expect a new neural network model with better represent
in addit we propos an ensembl learn approach to effici combin potenti nn backbon
perform evalu is examin for the popular mura dataset and show the superior of the propos model with respect to state-of-the-art bcnn method notabl by 0.86 in f1 score and 0.72 in cohen s kappa metric while ask for neglig complex overhead .
