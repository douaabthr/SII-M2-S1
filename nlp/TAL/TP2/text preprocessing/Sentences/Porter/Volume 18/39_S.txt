multi-object optim for order assign in the food cart evalu system
the rapid growth of the food deliveri industri driven by increasingli busi lifestyl present custom with the challeng of find high-qual food at an optim price
thi decision-mak process is made more difficult by the lack of a trustworthi food cart evalu system
thi studi propos a model that enabl custom to evalu food cart base on servic qualiti food qualiti and cost-effect
the model appli multi-object optim to balanc these factor use three evolutionari algorithm non-domin sort genet algorithm ii strength pareto evolutionari algorithm 2 and indicator-bas evolutionari algorithm
the propos system gener pareto-optim solut that guid custom in select the best food cart
addit the effect of the propos food cart evalu system can be valid by compar it with other algorithm in term of pareto optim result hypervolum gener distanc invert gener distanc and epsilon indic
the model wa valid by swiggi food chain data which demonstr that our approach effect minim cost while maxim food cart rate
the result demonstr that the propos system can significantli enhanc custom decision-mak in select food cart offer a practic tool for both consum and the food deliveri industri
final use statist techniqu we present a compar studi of the result with the current zomato and swiggi food chain data rate .
