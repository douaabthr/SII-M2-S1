an effici model use deep convolut neural network for model underwat imag
underwat photographi suffer from the dispers of light in water
blur and color distort of an imag are difficult aspect of underwat imag analysi
variou method have been investig for provid solut for underwat imag restor
nevertheless these approach still exhibit a regress
herein we describ a deep convolut neural network dcnetui for medium transmiss estim
dcnetui adopt deep convolut neural network dcnn whose layer are special design to embodi the establish assumptions/prior in imag restor
specif layer of maxout unit are use to extract almost all haze-relev featur
parallel convolut with multi scale featur are use to remov haze
max-pol layer is abl to preserv resolut of the featur map
we also propos a novel nonlinear activ function bilater rectifi linear unit brelu which allevi the noisi problem
to refin the transmiss map gradient filter is use to smooth the imag
final the perform of the propos and exist method were verifi by compar the experiment result with those of known method under qualiti metric set
experi on benchmark imag show that dcnetui achiev superior perform over exist method yet keep effici and easi to use . the recommend method enhanc the color of an imag by remov the influenc of the aquat element
it increas the ssim by 29% with a valu of 0.967 and psnr of 47% with a maximum valu of 54.537 .
