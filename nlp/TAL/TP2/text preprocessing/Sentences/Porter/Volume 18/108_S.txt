intellig paramet adapt in fuzzi neural network
thi paper address the offlin handwritten signatur recognit task a challeng classif problem due to high intra-class variabl and inter-class similar
the object is to accur classifi signatur imag into their correspond ident class despit inher uncertainti and imprecis in signatur data
to address thi a convolut neural network is employ for featur extract gener a robust represent of each signature-a discrimin and noise-toler featur vector that captur essenti structur element of the signatur
these featur are then classifi use a fuzzi min-max neural network which excel in handl overlap and ambigu pattern
howev fuzzi min-max neural network s perform is highli sensit to it paramet vigil threshold and sensit often requir time-consum manual tune
to overcom thi limit an evolut strategi is propos for automat paramet optim
thi method use an adapt fit function and a dynam mutat strategi to effici explor the paramet space and acceler converg
the approach is valid on a proprietari offlin signatur dataset and the result demonstr that the propos evolut strategy-fuzzi min-max neural network system achiev superior accuraci precis and robust compar to baselin and state-of-the-art method .
