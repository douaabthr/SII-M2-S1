novel hybrid swarm intellig algorithm for solv the capacit vehicl rout problem effici
thi paper introduc a novel global optim framework igwoa_obl_m which integr the whale optim algorithm woa and grey wolf optim gwo further enhanc through the integr of mutat strategi ms and opposition-bas learn obl
the igwoa_obl_m aim to effect balanc explor and exploit by util woa s capabl for extens global search alongsid gwo s profici local optim
obl expand the search space while mutat strategi enhanc solut divers and address stagnat
the framework s perform is rigor evalu on cec 2022 benchmark function show superior optim capabl compar to exist method
it is further test on a rang of standard capacit vehicl rout problem cvrp benchmark dataset demonstr scalabl and robust across differ problem scale
final the algorithm is appli to two real-world cement deliveri case studi where it effect optim the dual object of balanc cost and time
thi highlight it practic applic in sustain logist and it abil to handl complex multi-object trade-off
these result establish the igwoa_obl_m framework as a signific advanc in hybrid meta-heurist provid robust scalabl solut for cvrp and complex multidimension optim challeng .
