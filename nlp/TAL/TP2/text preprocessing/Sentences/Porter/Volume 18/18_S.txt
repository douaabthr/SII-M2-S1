compar analysi of accuraci and comput complex across 21 swarm intellig algorithm
nonlinear complex optim problem are preval in mani scientif and engin field
tradit algorithm often struggl with these problem due to their high dimension and intric natur make them time-consum
mani research have propos new metaheurist algorithm inspir by biolog behavior in natur which compar show higher perform and accuraci than tradit optim algorithm
nature-inspir algorithm particularli those base on swarm intellig offer adapt and effici solut to these challeng
in recent year swarm intellig algorithm have made signific advanc
classic and cec benchmark suit are immers use for studi the perform of optim algorithm
accord to our literatur survey we identifi that mani algorithm were evalu base on accuraci
current swarm intellig algorithm are use in mani applic and effici and comput complex need to be evalu
a broad-level studi of the comput complex and accuraci of popular swarm intellig algorithm ha not been done recent
therefor thi studi we comprehens evalu and compar 21 bio-inspir swarm intellig algorithm on eight non-separ unimod eight separ unimod five non-separ multimod seven separ multimod function and two cec 2018 mani object function
we studi the structur and mathemat model of the select algorithm
then we categor select algorithm into six differ behavior group
we calcul the root mean squar error between expect and actual valu
then we perform an rmse cross-valid statist test to understand how accur an algorithm resolv an averag problem
we found that artifici lizard search optim also is the most promin algorithm in accuraci and effici
besid that cat swarm optim cso squirrel search algorithm ssa and chimp optim algorithm choa-b are also consid more univers algorithm
the squirrel search algorithm ssa is also s second-best algorithm in time complex
wasp swarm algorithm wso and bat-inspir algorithm ba present the lowest time complex
final sever import issu and research direct are discuss .
