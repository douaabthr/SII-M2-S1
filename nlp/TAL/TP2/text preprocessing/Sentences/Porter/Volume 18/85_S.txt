a multi-object optim algorithm for optim bailout alloc in large-scal bank system under risk contagion
the interbank lend busi connect bank into a network provid a channel for risk contagion
to control the spread of thi risk the govern need to provid time bailout
the current bailout algorithm face sever challeng 1 most research on bailout strategi onli consid static environ after risk converg 2 the larg number of bank in real-world bank system result in an enorm decis space
so to address the first issu thi paper transform the dynam bailout problem into a static multi-object optim model and develop a dynam govern bailout framework
to effici handl high-dimension decis variabl an improv genet algorithm the large-scal non-domin sort genet algorithm is propos
thi method analyz the relationship between decis variabl and object group relat variabl and decompos the larg decis space into smaller subspac
it also introduc two local search strategi to enhanc explor and improv solut qualiti
experi on both benchmark test and real-world case confirm that the propos method outperform exist algorithm in term of solut qualiti and comput effici .
