improv bio-inspir algorithm for schedul distribut no-wait flow shop with setup time
thi paper address the distribut permut flow shop schedul problem motiv by an industri applic relat to the manufactur of print circuit board
the goal is to minim total tardi while consid constraint such as no-wait and sequence-depend setup time
we have introduc an exact method base on mix integ linear program and three bio-inspir meta-heurist
specif we have explor the effect of three bio-inspir meta-heurist the artifici bee coloni abc migratori bird optim mbo and genet algorithm ga to tackl the problem at hand
to enhanc our approach and minim total tardi we incorpor local search improv techniqu
in addit to standard meta-heurist formul we integr special local search techniqu includ the path relink pr techniqu variabl neighborhood search vn and the individu improv scheme ii procedur
thi integr led to the develop of three enhanc meta-heurist hbox abc _ pr hbox mbo _ vn and hbox ga _ ii
through simul studi on variou instanc we have demonstr the superior perform of the hbox mbo _ vn algorithm achiev a success rate of 87.18 over other hybrid meta-heurist .
