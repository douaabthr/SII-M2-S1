an evolutionari algorithm tailor to the quadrat assign problem
thi research introduc a simpl yet effici evolutionari algorithm ea specif design to address the quadrat assign problem qap a notori difficult optim problem frequent encount in practic domain such as facil layout plan resourc alloc circuit board design and logist
ea excel at explor the solut space while focus on promis region mitig the risk of get stuck in suboptim solut
the propos hybrid ea augment with a hill-climb local search incorpor care design oper and mechan tailor to the qap
rigor test on the qaplib standard librari of benchmark instanc origin provid by corl l demonstr it competit perform strike a balanc between solut qualiti and comput effici compar to cutting-edg method
the approach requir minim paramet tune and ha a veri low implement complex make it practic and conveni to use
thi research highlight the signific potenti of care adapt ea for effect address complex combinatori optim challeng as exemplifi by their success applic to the qap .
