bim model gener and protect an autom solut under deep learn and differenti privaci
in respons to the problem of low accuraci low effici and insuffici data secur in build inform model model an autom scheme base on deep learn and differenti privaci is introduc to improv the effici and secur of construct project
firstli thi articl util residu network and long short-term memori model to extract featur from the spatial structur and tempor inform of the build inform model model
secondli it use the adam optim for gradient descent to optim network weight then for the evalu of geometr accuraci and data integr thi articl adjust the number of network layer and convolut kernel size
at the same time thi articl integr a differenti privaci framework into the model dynam adjust the privaci budget and final evalu the build inform model model for autom gener and protect
the research result indic that the build inform model model had an accuraci of 0.94 in align the edg of the structur framework and the intern partit wall angl deviat wa onli 0.10
it error in the area cover by intern partit and floor wa onli 0.04 with a success rate of 0.82 for data leakag risk a detect rate of 0.91 and a respons time of 0.09 s
the model can ensur the secur of critic inform while achiev high accuraci and effici .
