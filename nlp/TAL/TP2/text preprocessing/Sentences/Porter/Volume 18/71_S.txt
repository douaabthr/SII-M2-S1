applic of interv laplac transform in a product system with price and qualiti depend demand via water cycl algorithm
laplac transform is a potent mathemat approach utilis in mani disciplin includ mathemat engin physic and control theori
it is gener use to simplifi challeng mathemat issu and solv differenti equat
interv uncertainti is a notion use in decis theori risk analysi and statist to express and manag uncertainti in a more flexibl and less specif fashion
it is also known as interval-valu uncertainti or interv uncertainti analysi
it differ from point estim and precis probabl and is especi help when there is littl knowledg of a variabl s specif valu or when work with uncertain data
here we appli the concept of interv laplac transform for solv a manufactur model as well as demand function is taken as interv form on sell price and the qualiti of the item
we have solv the develop interv valu product model with the help of one numer exampl interv order relat and water cycl algorithm wca
in order to justifi the result from wca we have compar the result from other popular metaheurist algorithm
lastli an investig of post optim is be research to offer some manageri insight .
