an effici plant diseas predict model base on machin learn and deep learn classifi
agricultur is the majorsourc of the nation s econom growth but the emerg of certain plant-rel diseas ha a neg effect on the sector s product
diagnos plant diseas is crucial to solv thi issu teach farmer how to prevent diseas and implement effect manag
the total yield may be neg impact by diseas if they are not discov earli which would reduc the farmer s profit
numer research have present variou cutting-edg system base on numer techniqu to address thi issu
numer approach have been use alreadi by research for thi purpos but some techniqu relat to vision have not yet been investig
six cutting-edg model for plant diseas detect base on machin learn and deep learn were briefli deliber in thi research to analyz the effici of each approach
in thi research the resnet-101 model is use to effici extract the featur and the accuraci sensit and specif of the metric are measur to demonstr the effici of each model
recent research ha shown averag accuraci of 94.38% 94.785 and 92.45% in the detect of appl potato and strawberri diseas respect .
