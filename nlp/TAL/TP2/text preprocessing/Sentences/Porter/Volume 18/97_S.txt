on the analyt solut of the nonlinear strain wave equat through the bilinear neural network method
in thi paper we investig the strain wave equat which govern the behavior of elast wave propag in differ media of continuum mechan
due to the nonlinear of the equat it is often difficult to achiev exact solut use certain tradit analyt and numer approach
in thi work we use the bilinear neural network method to provid exact solut to the strain wave equat
thi method effect build solut by util deep learn algorithm and bilinear transform
the bilinear neural network method provid a potent substitut for tradit method by method approxim nonlinear wave pattern and map them into a solvabl framework
the strain wave equat provid an insight into the nonlinear long wave propag behavior in shallow water by take wave phase into account and it versatil extend beyond fluid dynam to variou physic phenomena
by employ structur neural network model the gener lump period and other exact analyt solut are obtain use the bilinear neural network approach
with the help of mathematica we extract these solut and illustr them in 3d 2d and contour plot
these visual help illustr the dynam of the solut obtain
the comput effici of the method wa illustr through it capac to symbol deriv closed-form solut without the need for iter numer method and in turn diminish process time and complex significantli
the novelti of thi work is the combin of bilinear transform method and neural network architectur to symbol obtain exact analyt solut as highlight abov for the nonlinear strain wave equat repres a remark breakthrough compar to the convent numer and analyt method
the valid of the solut acquir wa establish by direct substitut in the bilinear equat as well as through check their complianc with the equat of strain wave with the help of mathematica .
