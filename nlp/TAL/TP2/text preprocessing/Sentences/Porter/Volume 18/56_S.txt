coverag optim in wireless sensor network base on multi-strategi dung beetl optim algorithm
wireless sensor network wsn compos of numer distribut sensor node is wide use across variou field but face sever challeng with coverag optim be one of the most critic
the size of the node coverag area directli impact network perform
to address thi issu a multi-strategi dung beetl optim algorithm msdbo is propos to optim coverag in two-dimension and three-dimension region
in msdbo to maxim the effect of roll ball beetl the proport of roll ball beetl is dynam chang
optim boundari control strategi effect util relev posit inform to ensur that the search capabl of the algorithm is not affect by boundari constraint
addit a random number is employ to chang the inertia factor
final to enhanc the capabl of the algorithm to escap local optima the current solut optim solut and posit of randomli select are integr to gener a new solut
subsequ compar with other algorithm on the cec2017 and cec2022 test set the perform of the algorithm is evalu in both two-dimension and three-dimension wsn scenario
the result indic that the maximum averag coverag of msdbo in 2d and 3d scene can reach 96.97% and 77.7% respect .
