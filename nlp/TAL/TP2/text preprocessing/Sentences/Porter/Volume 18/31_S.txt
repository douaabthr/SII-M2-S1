stochast pfrcossim layer for solv filter redund problem in cnn appli on plant diseas classif
convolut neural network cnn have achiev remark success in variou artifici intellig domain particularli in pattern recognit imag process and speech recognit
howev the grow complex of these model introduc challeng relat to paramet redund significantli impact cnn perform
thi paper address the issu of increas paramet redund focus on the specif problem of filter redund dure cnn train
the propos approach involv regular of the initi filter to reduc redund at each convolut layer
a novel layer pfrcossim is introduc comput the cosin similar between filter use in cnn train to ensur filter homogen
we reset the filter use an orthogon initi base on the random choic of kernel concern all filter in the same layer
the method is test on a three-lay cnn model and extend to common architectur like lenet and vgg16
valid is perform through plant diseas classif use dataset plant patholog 2020 and plant diseas recognit
the applic of thi approach yield signific accuraci improv exceed 99 .
