golden jackal optim algorithm with a popul qualiti improv framework for real-world engin optim problem
in thi studi a popul qualiti improv pqi framework to enhanc the perform of the recent emerg nature-inspir metaheurist algorithm name golden jackal optim gjo algorithm for solv real-world engin optim problem is propos
firstli the maximin lh strategi is employ to gener the initi popul which can effici enhanc the search space in the earli stage
then a non-linear popul reduct mechan is appli to screen out the individu with unsatisfi solut and it can also reduc the comput complex
meanwhil a novel circular mutat strategi is introduc which can dynam adjust the algorithm to explor in a wilder space or to exploit deeper thi method can not onli acceler the converg of the optim but also reduc the risk of trap in the local optima
moreov the propos framework show tremend potenti in applic to other population-bas search algorithm due to that the algorithm are improv while remain the inher mathemat structur and search strategi
the experiment result demonstr that the propos framework can effici improv the perform of gjo on solv real-world engin optim problem and the propos pqi gjo algorithm can save 196.7001 h 0.3595 mw and 0.0552 p. u
in comparison with the state-of-art algorithm jaya in solv opf problem for ieee-57 bu system .
