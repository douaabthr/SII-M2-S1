dskn deep spike kroneck network for leaf type classif and multi-class leaf diseas detect in internet of thing base sustain agricultur
plant diseas detect is particularli a critic complex in the agricultur farm field
earlier and precis detect of leaf diseas in plant aid in enhanc crop product and economi while reduc environment damag
diseas prognosi in plant requir more work and inform on plant diseas
therefor plant diseas detect is the major potenti techniqu in agricultur that is gain essenti interest in farm as well as comput commun
to subdu thi issu a systemat framework is propos for multi-class leaf diseas detect in the internet of thing iot base sustain agricultur use the deep spike kroneck network dskn
the iot node are simul and then rout is perform by the multi-object fraction artifici bee coloni algorithm algorithm
at base station multi-class leaf diseas detect is execut
the imag is pre-process by a gaussian filter
the crop leaf diseas area segment is carri out by unext and then imag augment is done use posit and color augment
afterward featur extract is perform
thereaft leaf-typ classif is accomplish by the propos dskn
after the identif of type the detect of multi-class crop leaf diseas is achiev use the propos dskn
the perform of the propos dskn is evalu use accuraci true posit rate tpr and fals posit rate fpr metric base on plant villag databas http github . com/spmohanty/plantvillage-dataset/tree/master/raw/color and crop diseas imag dataset http www . kaggl . com/datasets/jawadali1045/20k-multi-class-crop-disease-imag
it observ that the propos method obtain best outcom of 90.76% 90.75% and 9.35% for accuraci tpr and fpr use the plant villag databas .
