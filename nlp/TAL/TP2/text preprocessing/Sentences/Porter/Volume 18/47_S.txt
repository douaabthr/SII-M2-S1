neural network-driven scenario predict for adapt rout in manet use expand ring search and random earli detect
rout in mobil ad hoc network manet is complex due to their decentr topolog and dynam environ
convent rout protocol frequent have troubl maintain reliabl end-to-end commun lead to issu such as high packet loss unstabl rout and increas delay
the research present a novel deep-learn model with hybrid optim to maintain rout stabil through stabl node predict and optim rout discoveri in a manet environ
here dynam spars recurrent-convolut neural network dsr-cnn an advanc variant of the r-cnn famili is employ to detect the stabl node in a spars and dynam environ
the weight paramet of the dsr-cnn are optim by the enhanc fick s law optim algorithm for the improv node predict maintain reliabl and connect
moreov the most stabl rout are construct through the giant treval optim optim rout explor and recoveri
the model is design and simul in a python environ with the requir network set
the util of the propos research in the manet commun show 98% predict accuraci 2.48 ms delay 25mbp throughput and 99% of packet deliveri ratio which are more effici than the prevail techniqu s result show the highest rout stabil
these find highlight the potenti of dsr-cnn to significantli improv the reliabl and perform of manet set a new benchmark for futur rout protocol .
