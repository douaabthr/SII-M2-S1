matrix-bas particl swarm optim with hybrid strategi for multi-travel salesman problem
the multipl travel salesman problem mtsp is an extens of the travel salesman problem which involv multipl salespeopl visit a set of citi with each citi be visit onli onc
it is wide use in logist distribut traffic schedul and multi robot collabor but face challeng such as high comput complex difficult task alloc and suscept to local optim solut
most exist method focu on find solut from scratch primarili aim to minim the total travel distanc with insuffici attent paid to balanc travel cost among salespeopl
thi articl propos a matrix base multi strategi integr particl swarm optim algorithm which improv effici through matrix represent and parallel comput and introduc a dynam divers mechan to balanc local and global search capabl
in addit a new fit evalu function ha been design to effect address signific rout differ among salespeopl
among the five typic tsp problem the perform of thi algorithm is superior to mpso hjspso and standard pso algorithm
it significantli improv solv effici and enhanc result balanc
thi studi provid an effici and robust solut for the mtsp problem which ha import theoret signific and practic applic valu .
