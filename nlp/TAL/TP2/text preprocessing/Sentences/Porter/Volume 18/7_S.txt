enhanc sand cat swarm optim base on multi-strategi mix for solv engin optim problem
the sand cat swarm optim scso algorithm is character by slow converg speed and a tendenc to becom trap in local optima
to address these issu a hybrid multi-strategi variant known as hscso is propos
the algorithm first employ an elit opposition-bas learn strategi which gener complementari candid solut provid a more divers set of initi solut and improv the distribut of individu posit
subsequ a greedi strategi is util to combin the posit updat strategi of the golden sine algorithm which ha a fix search pattern with the posit updat strategi of the scso which featur random search characterist
thi combin retain the advantag of fast converg while also provid a divers set of random candid solut
final a random inertia weight is introduc to assist the scso algorithm in adapt adjust the search step size and optim direct base on the differ phase of the search process therebi help the algorithm effect avoid local optima
the improv algorithm wa compar with two classic origin algorithm and six differ algorithm variant on 25 benchmark function
the experiment result indic that hscso exhibit faster converg and higher solut accuraci on most benchmark function
furthermor the perform of hscso wa evalu on the cec2019 and cec2021 test suit as well as sever engin optim problem
the experiment result valid the competit and superior of the propos hscso algorithm demonstr it potenti for applic in the field of global optim .
