improv two-arch evolutionari algorithm for constrain multi-object optim of wwtp base on intergener inform guidanc
maintain the balanc between feasibl converg and divers is a challeng in constrain multi-object optim problem for the oper perform of the wastewat treatment process wwtp
thi paper propos an improv two-arch evolutionari algorithm for constrain multiobject optim c-taea base on intergener inform guidanc name iig-c-taea
first the propos algorithm propos a mate select mechan to fairli screen elit solut in three aspect feasibl converg and divers
then the algorithm employ intergener inform to guid offspr iter by adjust crossov and mutat probabl and establish neighborhood between intergener popul
final an archive-driven mechan is introduc to select high-qual solut and to establish an associ between archiv base on popul inform enhanc the balanc of divers converg and feasibl
the efficaci of the propos algorithm is confirm through compar analys conduct on benchmark problem and wastewat optim problem demonstr it superior over other constrain multi-object optim evolutionari algorithm in comparison .
