hybrid evolutionari grey wolf optim for constrain engin problem and multi-unit product plan
a novel approach call hybrid evolutionari gwo he-gwo is propos to enhanc the effect of the grey wolf optim gwo for handl dynam landscap
thi approach combin the strength of the canon gwo with differenti evolut de to achiev a high-level hybrid
he-gwo enhanc the leadership-bas guidanc system and incorpor an evolutionari dimension hunt system with popul subgroup to increas the divers of the wolfpack
dynam tune set are specif devis to regul the balanc between explor and exploit and to facilit the evolut of the wolfpack by increas it divers
the propos method is verifi through rigor benchmark test use three recent benchmark suit includ cec2020 cec2019 and the 100 digit competit as well as the cec2021 benchmark suit
subsequ a compar analysi is perform on five standard engin problem
the propos he-gwo is evalu against a total of 23 meta-heurist which includ the standard gwo eight advanc and recent variant gwo ten recent meta-heurist and four state-of-the-art advanc meta-heurist
addit the winner of relev contest are also includ in the comparison
furthermor the effect of the suggest approach is verifi through eight instanc of a multi-unit product plan problem
thi problem consist of 270 decis variabl includ 162 integ variabl and 108 continu variabl
the experi involv appli a combin of penalti and constraint correct techniqu to handl the constraint
he-gwo ha consist outperform state-of-the-art algorithm and competit winner in benchmark achiev the highest profit in seven out of eight situat for the multi-unit product plan problem .
