bilevel optim base on forag by differ ant speci for real-tim transport plan
initi a transport process dure heavi traffic condit or advers weather condit ha a retract impact on the cost even if the transit path chosen is optim
thi paper propos an algorithm framework for a dynam transport process use a bilevel multi-object optim approach
dynam detect of road traffic measur come at an upper level and optim path estim come at the lower level of the bilevel model
aggreg of multipl object traffic distanc and qualiti of the path is done to formul the object function at a lower level
the intellig forag behaviour of differ ant speci inspir a bilevel optim model for the specif problem
the upper-level task of detect the dynam traffic measur is base on a forag strategi of harvest ant which use antenn contact to exchang inform with inmat regard food avail
the lower-level object of determin the optim rout is base on the pheromon trail-bas commun strategi use by other speci of ant
simul result obtain manifest the potenti natur of the propos method in the real-tim transport process .
