eeg signal classif use a new radial basi function neural network and jellyfish meta-heurist algorithm
the purpos of thi paper is to investig a new method for eeg signal classif
a power method for detect these signal can greatli contribut to area such as make robot arm for disabl peopl mind read and lie detect tool
to thi end thi studi make two interest contribut
as a major contribut a new classifi base on a radial basi function neural network rbfnn is present
as the center determin method of a rbfnn classifi ha a high impact on the final classif result we have adopt jellyfish search js algorithm for choos the center of the gaussian function in the hidden layer of the rbfnn classifi
addit local linear embed lle techniqu is investig for reduc the dimension of eeg signal
two seri of variou experi are design to valid our propos
in the first set of the experi the propos rbfnn classifi is compar with other state-of-the-art rbfnn classifi
in the second set of the experi the perform of the propos eeg signal classif are evalu on a challeng dataset for eeg signal classif
the experiment result demonstr the superior of our propos method even compar to the method base on the convolut neural network .
