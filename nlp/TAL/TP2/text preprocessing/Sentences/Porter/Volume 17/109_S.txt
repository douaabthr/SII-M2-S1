a model for optim energi manag in a microgrid use bioga
a more sustain energi matrix can be achiev through an integr approach to energi gener and end-consum self-product
thi altern can reduc consum energi cost and enabl the matur and boost of distribut gener technolog
use reliabl cost model with smart-grid technolog enabl more econom effici energi system
previous disregard energi solut can becom viabl solut such as electr energi gener use bioga
in thi context the contribut of thi studi is threefold
first we develop a cost model of electr and mechan energi gener for local consum in microgrid-produc bioga
second we integr into the model a dual-fuel motor to gener electr energi use a variabl mixtur of bioga and other fuel and the biomethan upgrad system to suppli the mechan demand
third base on thi model an optim energi manag tool is propos
the perform of thi tool is analyz through scenario simul of an exist microgrid compos of a motor engin fuel by bioga produc intern a photovolta pv system a batteri bank and connect to the util
the result indic the econom advantag of adopt the tool and the use of the propos model
besid the reduc electr cost it also allow analysi of how each piec of equip contribut to the electr cost which can be help in futur decis about equip size .
