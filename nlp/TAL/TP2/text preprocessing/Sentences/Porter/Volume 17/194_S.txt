ardod adapt radiu density-bas outlier detect
outlier detect ha garner consider attent in recent year due to it wide-rang applic across variou research domain
thi surg in interest ha led to the develop of numer detect techniqu predominantli base on distanc or densiti metric
a notabl limit of these exist method is their relianc on paramet adjust significantli affect the outcom
addit these method exhibit intrins flaw distance-bas approach struggl with cluster with vari local densiti while density-bas method fail to identifi pattern within low-dens area
moreov most prior techniqu are adept at identifi onli one kind of outlier local global or group of outlier
address these challeng we introduc the adapt radiu density-bas outlier detect ardod method which depart from the tradit parameter-depend approach
ardod is a novel parameter-fre algorithm that dynam determin the necessari paramet base on the data distribut within the featur space
thi innov method demonstr robust perform in detect all three categori of outlier
the efficaci and superior perform of ardod are valid through an extens experiment analysi involv variou synthet and real-world dataset
thi analysi showcas ardod s advantag over seven establish method local outlier factor lof angle-bas outlier detect abod robust distance-bas outlier score rdo direct densiti ratio chang rate-bas outlier detect dcrod empirical-cumulative-distribution-bas outlier detect ecod mean-shift outlier detector mod and local global outlier detect lgod underscor it potenti as a versatil tool in outlier detect research .
