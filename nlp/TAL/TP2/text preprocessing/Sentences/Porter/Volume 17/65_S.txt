singl candid optim a novel optim algorithm
single-solution-bas optim algorithm have gain littl to no attent by the research commun unlik population-bas approach
thi paper propos a novel optim algorithm call singl candid optim sco that reli onli on a singl candid solut throughout the whole optim process
the propos algorithm implement a uniqu set of equat to effect updat the posit of the candid solut
to balanc explor and exploit sco is integr with the two-phas strategi where the candid solut updat it posit differ in each phase
the effect of the propos approach is valid by test it on thirti three classic benchmark function and four real-world engin problem
sco is compar with three well-known optim algorithm i.e. particl swarm optim grey wolf optim and gravit search algorithm and with four recent high-perform algorithm equilibrium optim archimed optim algorithm mayfli algorithm and salp swarm algorithm
accord to friedman and wilcoxon rank-sum test sco can significantli outperform all other algorithm for the major of the investig problem
the result achiev by sco motiv the design and develop of new single-solution-bas optim algorithm to further improv the perform
the sourc code of sco is publicli avail at http uk . mathwork . com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/116100-single-candidate-optim .
