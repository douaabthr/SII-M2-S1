deepsens test priorit for neural network base on multipl mutat and manifold spatial distribut
deep learn system have been use extens in sever field in recent year but deep neural network dnn can also make incorrect decis and lead to signific loss
test task base on dnn system often requir annot of test data to obtain oracl inform
howev collect and annot larg amount of dispar data from applic scenario is veri expens and time consum
thu we propos deepsens an effect neural network test priorit techniqu to select more test input that reveal neural network fault as earli as possibl in the unlabel test dataset
deepsens consid the full rang of model fault detect capabl includ fault near the boundari and near the centroid of class
to be specif we first design multipl mutat featur and extract them from the neural network model and input sampl base on differ mutat oper
then the sampl embed featur are extract to construct an undirect weight graph and a random walk is perform to calcul the distanc similar and manifold similar and then spatial nearest neighbor featur are design and extract
final mlp is use to combin multipl mutat featur and spatial nearest neighbor featur to predict the input sampl fault reveal abil and set prioriti accordingli
we evalu deepsens on four popular imag dataset and result show that deepsens significantli outperform exist test input priorit techniqu .
