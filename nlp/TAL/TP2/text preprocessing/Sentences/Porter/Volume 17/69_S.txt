a gener trust establish model architectur for design robust trust establish model
the intellig agent that popul multi-ag system mass can exhibit vari behaviour depend on their design and the environ in which they resid
thu truste must be abl to adapt how they interact with trustor to ensur that the truste are trust in the environ
to accomplish thi variou trust establish model have been propos to allow truste to adjust their behaviour to becom more trustworthi toward the trustor in an environ
by use a gener trust establish model architectur model can be design for variou domain and assumpt along with the inclus of a new preprocess modul that allow for both transaction-level preprocess and trustor-level postprocess
the propos architectur is design to be compat with both exist and new model
a simpl yet robust trust establish model use thi architectur call the gener trust establish model gtem is defin to exhibit the benefit from use a gener architectur with preprocess
through simul with and without the preprocess modul in gtem along with use two addit trust establish model the architectur is shown to provid more fine-tun result when use the preprocess modul
gtem use the preprocess modul achiev a higher good transact rate and higher averag direct trust faster than other model within the environ .
