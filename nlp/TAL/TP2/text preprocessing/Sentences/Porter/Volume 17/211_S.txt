fqpdr feder quantum neural network for privacy-preserv earli detect of diabet retinopathi
diabet retinopathi dr is a common complic of diabet that can lead to blind of peopl
detect dr at the earliest stage is essenti to prevent irrevers eye damag
microaneurysm dot are the first sign of dr
as the dot are tini and of low contrast detect mild dr is a veri challeng task
feder learn fl preserv data privaci which is a major concern for medic imag process
fl is a collabor learn method which share onli the model paramet with a server without share the patient data to a central server
inspir by classic fl we propos a feder learning-bas quantum neural network feder qnn for thi task
we implement the model with limit sampl and few learnabl paramet from the e-ophtha and retina mnist dataset
the cross-evalu effici of the propos feder quantum neural network system for privacy-preserv earli detect of diabet retinopathi fqpdr in kaggl dataset imag indic the robust of the light weight learn model
fqpdr perform are inspir while consid exist non-fl and fl method .
