toward robust autom math problem solv a survey of statist and deep learn approach
autom mathemat problem-solv repres a uniqu intersect of natur languag process nlp and mathemat reason pose signific challeng in semant comprehens and logic deduct
thi survey paper explor the domain of mathemat word problem mwp focus on the nuanc integr of linguist understand and mathemat logic requir for their resolut
despit progress the autom solut of mwp through nlp techniqu remain challeng
we present a comprehens review of the latest dataset and comput model focus on those address geometr tabular and multimod problem types-area not extens cover in prior survey
our review extend beyond previou survey by analyz the solv of mwp in languag such as hindi and arab area less explor in exist research
we critic review the latest dataset and comput model design for mwp highlight the scarciti of resourc that cater to the complex of problem in hindi arab and similar languag
thi gap underscor the need for comprehens dataset that reflect the divers of mwp in these languag and for model capabl of navig the linguist nuanc inher in non-english and non-chines context
our analysi point to the limit of current approach includ their focu on specif data format and limit generaliz across differ mathemat context
furthermor our critic analysi identifi prevail limit within current methodolog includ over-reli on specif data format and a lack of generaliz across divers mathemat context
in respons we propos a research agenda to develop sophist model that understand and reason across a broader spectrum of problem type and languag and creat dataset that captur the real-world divers of mwp in hindi arab and beyond
thi paper set a direct for futur research to advanc nlp-driven mathemat problem-solv toward technic adept and univers applic model across linguist boundari therebi make stride toward truli global nlp applic in educ and beyond .
