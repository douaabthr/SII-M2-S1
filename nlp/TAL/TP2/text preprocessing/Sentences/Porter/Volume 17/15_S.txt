log-period power law hybrid model base on bp neural network
stock market crash bring about huge econom loss so predict the stock market crash is extrem import for both the investor and practition
back propag bp neural network perform greatli in data adapt and fit it ha been wide use for forecast studi in variou field
howev given the low frequenc and lack of period of stock market crash the bp neural network can hardli predict the intens fluctuat stock price accur dure the crash
to resolv thi issu we introduc bp neural network into log-period power law model propos the log-period power law hybrid model base on the bp neural network
thi combin approach could further captur the fluctuat trend and predict the volatil dure the stock market crash better
the experiment result show that thi hybrid model could predict the stock price in differ stock market with a slightli increas accuraci
moreov it perform wa more stabl compar with bp neural network .
