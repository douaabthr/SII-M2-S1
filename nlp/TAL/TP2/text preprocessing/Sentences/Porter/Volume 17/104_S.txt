an extrem learn machin model base on adapt multi-fus chaotic sparrow search algorithm for regress and classif
extrem learn machin elm is a machin learn algorithm base on singl hidden layer feedforward neural network
compar with tradit neural network algorithm elm ha the advantag of fast train speed and good gener abil with guarante learn accuraci which ha been wide use in practic problem
howev due to the random of hidden layer paramet the origin elm requir more hidden neuron in applic make the network more complex
for thi reason we propos an improv extrem learn machin base on the adapt multi-fus chaotic sparrow search algorithm amfcssa call amfcssa-elm
in our work amfcssa is special design which combin the techniqu of chaotic map adapt weight coeffici variabl spiral factor andt-distribut mutat to optim the input weight and hidden bias of elm
firstli unimod and multimod test function are use to verifi the perform of amfcssa the result show that amfcssa can search for the global optim valu better than pso ssa and so on
secondli variou nonlinear function and classif dataset are taken to test the capabl of amfcssa-elm the simul result show that our method ha better gener perform compar with other similar algorithm such as pso-elm ssa-elm .
