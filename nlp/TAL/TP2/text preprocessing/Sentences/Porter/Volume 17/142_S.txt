fast aggreg method of wsn dynam data base on micro-clust evolutionari learn
in order to complet restor wsn data and improv the qualiti of data aggreg a fast aggreg method of wsn dynam data base on micro-clust evolutionari learn is propos
the wireless sensor network data is collect under the micro-clust evolutionari learn and the kalman filter is introduc
accord to the linear express area of the filter in space the linear regress rang of the wireless sensor network data is given and the dynam data preprocess and featur extract of wsn are design
accord to the extract result the parent node of each node in the tree is set to form a rout tree with the base station as the root node for data forward
the featur of the target domain are extract and input into the rang determin layer and then the wsn dynam data are quickli aggreg to realiz the rapid aggreg of wsn dynam data
the experiment result show that the propos method ha low averag entropi good converg accuraci stabl data converg qualiti and strong repair perform .
