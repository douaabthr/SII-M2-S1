preliminari analysi of explain machin learn method for multipl myeloma chemotherapi treatment recognit
the choic of chemotherapi treatment protocol is an import step in the treatment of multipl myeloma and ha a signific impact on the patient s prognosi
in thi work we propos an explain machin learning-bas framework for the recognit of multipl myeloma chemotherapi treatment
a two-stag framework is pursu where three of the most popular local and global agnost explain artifici intellig xai tool permut featur import kernel shap and lime are appli to explain the decis of differ machin learn black box model such as random forest svm xgboost and mlp
a preliminari studi analysi is carri out to investig the variou outcom propos by each method on a multipl myeloma chemotherapi treatment collect dataset
experi show that the rf algorithm reach the best recognit with 98.63% classif accuraci follow by xgboost mlp and svm with 95.89% 92.23% and 87.21% respect
howev among the three appli xai model kernel shap provid more transpar by emphas the featur involv in the classif result
the studi highlight the import of transpar and the precaut need when interpret exist xai tool
we also rais import question about the futur improv of explain machin learn techniqu for therapeut and diagnost applic .
