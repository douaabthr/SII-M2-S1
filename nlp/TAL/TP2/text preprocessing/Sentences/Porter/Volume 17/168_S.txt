research on pcb defect detect use artifici intellig a systemat map studi
smt surfac mount technolog ha been the backbon of pcb print circuit board product for the last coupl of decad
even though the speed and accuraci of smt have been drastic improv in the last decad error dure product are still a veri valid problem for the pcb industri
with the exponenti rise of artifici intellig in the last decad the smt industri wa one of the most eager industri to use thi new technolog to detect possibl defect dure product
late tradit imag process techniqu start to lag behind method such as machin learn and deep learn when the discuss came to the need of high accuraci
in thi paper we screen academ librari to understand which of the latest method and techniqu are use in the domain and to deduc a gener process for detect defect in pcb
dure the research we have investig research question relat to state-of-the-art method highli mention dataset and sought after pcb defect
all find and answer are map to be abl to understand where thi pursuit might point toward
from a total of 270 paper 90 of them were address in detail and 78 paper were chosen for thi systemat map .
