the first-stag is a cnn base recognit
the second-stag recognit is base on the zonal inform and script-specif orthograph rule
the work is carri out on the find that low recognit accuraci of meitei mayek handwritten charact is due to the presenc of highli shape-similar confus charact pair
first the confus charact pair are identifi from the confus matrix obtain while train and test the cnn
for these confus charact pair the zone inform and certain script-specif orthograph rule are incorpor in the second recognit stage to distinguish between them
the second-stag recognit is carri out onli on those charact which belong to one of the confus charact pair
thi make the techniqu comput more effici than those where it is carri out for everi output of the recognit stage
for zone identif a novel method base on the row co-ordin of charact present in the word is propos
an improv in the recognit accuraci is achiev with the two-stag approach compar to the single-stag recognit use the cnn
an improv ment in recognit accuraci of 3.36% is shown by our approach with a recognit accuraci of 91.86% .
