diabet risk prognosi with tree ensembl integr featur attribut method
tree ensembl machin learn model offer particular promis for medic applic becaus of their abil to handl both continu and categor data their faculti for model nonlinear relationship and eas with which hyperparamet can be adapt to improv perform
modern method includ random forest xgboost and lightgbm which are robust across mani area of diagnosi prognosi and medic treatment
yet a critic limit factor of ensembl is that they are difficult to interpret due to their complex inner work
in medicin the abil to explain and interpret a model can be vital for clinic accept and trust
diabet and cardiovascular diseas are two of the main caus of death in the unit state
identifi and predict these diseas in patient is the first step toward stop their progress
util the nhane diabet mortal data set it is shown that the random forest ensembl with optim hyperparamet yield a strong prognosi model
importantli conjoin random forest with shapley addit explan shap yield reliabl interpret of the contribut and interact among the featur
shap result are compar to the recent propos agnost permut algorithm .
