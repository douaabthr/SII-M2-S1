joint opposit select enhanc mountain gazel optim for brain stroke classif
a signific caus of death and long-term disabl global is brain stroke
stroke fall into one of two categori 1 ischem which account for roughli 85% of case when it is caus by abrupt cessat of blood suppli to a particular area of the brain and 2 hemorrhag which refer to bleed or blood leakag
to provid stroke patient with individu therapeut care meta-heurist algorithm make accur and time predict
the use of meta-heurist algorithm and machin learn in the healthcar sector is grow
a new meta-heurist algorithm call the mountain gazel optim mgo wa develop in part as a result of wild mountain gazel social structur but suffer from slow converg speed
consequ a modifi mgo mmgo approach use the joint opposit select oper which combin the select lead opposit and the dynam opposit learn approach to improv mgo
the purpos of thi studi is to evalu the perform of mmgo base on the k-nearest neighbor knn classifi in predict brain stroke in data set taken from kaggl
perform wa assess on the challeng cec 2020 benchmark test function
compar to seven well-known optim algorithm the statist result demonstr the superior of mmgo
furthermor the experiment result of mmgo-knn for categor brain stroke data set reveal that it outperform competitor in all data set with an overal accuraci of 95.5% a sensit of 99.34% a specif of 98.99% and a precis of 99.21% .
