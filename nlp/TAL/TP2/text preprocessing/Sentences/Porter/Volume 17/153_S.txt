model analysi and applic case for complex multi-system evolutionari optim
a complex system is made up of multipl relat and coupl subsystem
each subsystem ha it own set of multipl constraint and object and is commonli found in real-world applic
biogeography-bas complex system optim bbo/complex is a population-bas evolutionari intellig paradigm that ha been develop to solv complex system problem
the paper first present the framework of the propos method that consist of within-subsystem migrat cross-subsystem migrat and mutat oper
then a theoret model of the propos method is deriv use markov chain and the probabl transit matrix of each oper along with the gener multinomi theorem
the model provid exact mathemat formula that predict the limit probabl of optim perform for each possibl popul in the propos method
addit simul result of two sampl problem which includ multipl subsystem and multipl object confirm the markov model deriv
final the perform of the propos method is investig on an applic of a batteri charg system and numer simul show that the propos method is a promis optim method for the studi complex system .
