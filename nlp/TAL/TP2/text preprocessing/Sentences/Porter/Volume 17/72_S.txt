histogram-bas comparison of metric space use hmm
comparison is a power tool for decis support
mani measur have been propos for compar two metric space but they do not consid the data dispers in each metric space
furthermor no dedic measur ha yet been propos for compar two metric space contain element belong to variou subtyp of a global datatyp
in order to attenu the aforement limit thi paper propos a new techniqu for compar two metric space
more formal given a metric spacex histogram are use for perform a gradual analysi of the data dispers insid the neighborhood of each element ofx
thi is a refin of the neighborhood analysi realiz in an exist work
then anoth exist techniqu is use for associ one hidden markov model lambda _x withxsuch that lambda _x learn the bin valu and the visual shape of the histogram deriv from the instanc inx
meta-data deriv from lambda _x are then save as the compon of a descriptor vector overrightarrow x associ withx
final the comparison between two metric space is perform through the comparison of their respect associ descriptor vector use exist distanc or similar measur between two vector
the propos approach inherit the accuraci and the effici of the exist techniqu on which it reli
therefor the experi realiz in thi paper are onli intend to show how it can be use for compar particular metric space contain geoloc or star in the celesti sphere .
