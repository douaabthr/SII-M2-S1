robot vision base obstacl avoid for navig of unman aerial vehicl use fuzzi rule base optim deep learn model
recent the topic associ with robot are becom an interest research area
meanwhil intellig mobil robot or unman aerial vehicl uav ha great accept howev the navig and control of the devic are more complex
the shortag of deal with static obstacl and evad them due to secur and safe rout is a fundament need of the system
therefor an effectu robot obstacl avoid mechan use deep learn dl model optim with a swarm intellig procedur is propos
the main aim of thi method is to avoid collis with static obstacl and attain the target in an optim path
at first the propos method initi the obstacl and target place for mobil robot navig and their posit are collect
an innov path plan approach is present use adapt beetl swarm levi flight optim bslfo for optim path calcul
here distanc and path smooth paramet are consid for optim plan by the propos bslfo approach
the mobil robot are move to the best posit obtain by the bslfo approach
addit optim robot movement with collis avoid ha been perform by employ a fuzzi rule base optim deep neural network frdnn
the propos method is implement in the matlab platform and evalu the perform in term of perform metric includ accuraci recal precis and plan time
the maximum accuraci reach by the propos method for static and dynam obstacl is 98.62 which offer better obstacl avoid and effect path plan
consequ the overal experiment outcom prove that the propos model outperform the exist model .
