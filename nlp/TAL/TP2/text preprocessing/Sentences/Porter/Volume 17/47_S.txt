a chaotic adapt butterfli optim algorithm
butterfli optim algorithm is a popul intellig optim algorithm which is easi to fall into local optim and ha low search accuraci
in thi paper a chaotic adapt butterfli optim algorithm caboa is propos
firstli the kent map is use to initi the locat of individu butterfli and increas the divers of initi popul
secondli adapt switch probabl is introduc in search phase to balanc local search and global search phase
then the adapt weight coeffici is introduc to adjust the search direct and the move step of the individu butterfli to improv the converg speed and accuraci of the algorithm
final cauchi variat is carri out to guid the advanc direct of the popul and avoid fall into local optimum
in thi paper the algorithm is use to obtain the optim valu of 12 benchmark test function and is appli to the design of weld beam
experiment result show that the perform of the improv algorithm ha signific advantag over other comparison algorithm in the function optim experi the averag optim valu is improv by 99% compar with the origin algorithm and about 90% compar with other improv algorithm
meanwhil the algorithm propos in thi paper obtain the optim valu of all function and ha high effici
compar with other exist optim algorithm caboa ha better converg perform and certain competit and ha certain advantag in the applic field .
