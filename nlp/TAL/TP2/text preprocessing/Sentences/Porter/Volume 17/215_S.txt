swarm optim approach for the minmax regret fermat weber problem with budgeted-constrain uncertain point weight
given a set of exist point with their associ posit weight on the plane the classic fermat weber problem aim to find a new point that minim the overal weight distanc to the exist point
we investig in thi paper the fermat weber problem with budgeted-uncertain interv point weight
the minmax regret criterion is appli to identifi the meaning solut
we first studi some structur properti of the problem
then we develop an effici algorithm to solv the correspond problem where the swarm-ori algorithm are appli as subroutin
comput result show the benchmark result for these propos method
an examin is present on identifi the minmax regret fermat weber point concern establish a new airport in vietnam alongsid it applic in product transfer scenario .
