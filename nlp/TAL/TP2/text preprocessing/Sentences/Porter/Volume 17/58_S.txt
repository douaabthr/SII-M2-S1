extrins evolv system for breast cancer detect
standard method of assess breast cancer is a tripl test assess
in thi method initi a thorough medic examin and patient histori is evalu secondli imag of the breast use x-ray and/or ultrasound is done and final a preoper cytodiagnosi is done that is either fine needl aspir cytolog fnac or core needl biopsi cnb or both
fnac be a minim invas and rapidli perform test is prefer in mani case over cnb that is more invas
if a tripl test give posit result in ani one of the three step then the result is taken posit
fnac involv determin the cell size and shape paramet and base on their valu a case is classifi as benign or malign
to autom the process of decis make a novel techniqu ha been propos
in thi techniqu a digit logic circuit wa evolv use cartesian genet program cgp
a cgp network wa train and then test with fnac featur data from the breast cancer wisconsin dataset
the dataset consist of 669 sampl of which 350 sampl were use for train purpos and then the train system wa evalu with 349 test sampl
a number of experi were perform each with a differ set of network paramet
the best evolv network classifi the sampl with an accuraci of 99.42% which is higher than that produc with most of the contemporari techniqu
the network so produc can be implement on re-configur hardwar .
