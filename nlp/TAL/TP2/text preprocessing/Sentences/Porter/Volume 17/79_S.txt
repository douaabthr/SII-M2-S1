adapt fuzzi approach for load frequenc control use hybrid moth flame pattern search optim with real time valid
the intensifi progress in the transform of the power grid toward a new gener power system introduc frequenc regul challeng in oper which can be overcom with substanti benefit from the latest robust control approach along with suitabl smart optim tool
addit with the adopt of smart and intellig control scheme the latest commun technolog with the extens placement of smart devic there will be signific growth in real-tim system measur
under thi trend an adapt fuzzi pid a-flc-pid system will play a vital role in reduc transient time
in thi articl a novel adapt fuzzi control architectur intend for load frequenc control with a supplementari hybrid moth flame optim pattern search h-mfo-p algorithm is present
the propos approach is design to optim the control gain for the eventu fit of the object function
the hybrid algorithm smartli updat the scale factor of the adapt fuzzi control by consid variou proport and integr threshold
simul are perform on two area hydrotherm system with the ga unit
to valid the research outcom and measur the effect of the propos architectur the outcom are compar with recent research approach and practic is test use an opal-rt setup
the sturdi of the concern approach is studi with a wide rang of parameter and load condit
it is observ that the h-mfo-p scale a-flc-pid control establish superior improv in frequenc regul .
