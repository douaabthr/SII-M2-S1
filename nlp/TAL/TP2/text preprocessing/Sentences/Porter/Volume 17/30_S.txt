global optim condit for nonlinear optim problem
base on the altern theorem global optim condit for nonlinear program problem to be discuss in thi articl
firstli on the basi of the research of optim condit for polynomi optim problem the paper consid nonlinear program over constrain which are not real polynomi function
and then necessari global optim condit for nonlinear program problem with non-polynomi constraint function are propos and suffici global optim condit for polynomi object function program problem with non-polynomi constraint function are develop by use the altern theorem
final necessari and suffici global optim condit for 0 1 quadrat program problem are present .
