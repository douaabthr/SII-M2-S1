improv perform of pareto corner search-bas object reduct in many-object optim
multi-object optim evolutionari algorithm moea is one of the most well-known approach for solv the multi-object optim problem mop
when the number of object is greater than three the mop are consid as many-object optim problem maop and many-object optim evolutionari algorithm maoea are propos to solv maop
howev maop often contain redund object which do not conflict to ani other object or even correl posit to some other
these redund object serious degrad the effici of moeas/maoea so they should be remov to help maoea work better
therefor thi paper propos new object reduct algorithm which use a pareto corner search algorithm pcsea to gener non-domin solut at corner of pareto front pf and then appli machin learn techniqu to remov redund object
the propos method not onli promot the strength of pcsea in find non-domin solut but also promot the strength of machin learn algorithm in automat find the optim set of object
the experi on 36 instanc of dtlz5 i m and 10 instanc of wfg3 m show that the propos method can more often find the right set of object than six other benchmark method respect about 80% success compar to about 62% success of the other method .
