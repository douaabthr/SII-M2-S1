strengthen teach learning-bas optim algorithm for numer optim task
the teach learning-bas optim algorithm tlbo is an effici optim
howev it ha sever shortcom such as prematur converg and stagnat at local optima
in thi paper the strengthen teach learning-bas optim algorithm stlbo is propos to enhanc the basic tlbo s explor and exploit properti by introduc three strengthen mechan the linear increas teach factor the elit system compos of new teacher and class leader and the cauchi mutat
subsequ seven variant of stlbo are design base on the combin deploy of the three improv mechan
perform of the novel stlbo is evalu by implement them on thirteen numer optim task includ the seven unimod task f1 f7 and six multimod task f8 f13
the result show that stlbo7 is at the top of the list significantli better than the origin tlbo
moreov the remain six variant of stlbo also outperform tlbo
final a set of comparison are implement between stlbo7 and other advanc optim techniqu such as hs pso mfo ga and hho
the numer result and converg curv prove that stlbo7 clearli outperform other competitor ha stronger local optim avoid faster converg speed and higher solut accuraci
all the abov manifest that stlbo ha improv the search perform of tlbo
