thi paper present a scalabl mobil platform employ to autonom and intellig detect onlin small crack on road use a live camera feed and artifici intellig ai method
the robot artifact is equip with a vision-bas local system to enabl autonom navig area where gp global posit system may be poor or intermitt

the mobil robot platform is scalabl depend on the particular context and requir of the applic
as oppos to off-lin assess tool experiment result show the real-tim capabl of the system to autonom navig and detect crack on a pavement structur with an accuraci of 95% .
