a new method for build singl feedforward neural network model for multivari static regress problem a combin weight initi and construct algorithm
the perform of model base on a feedforward neural network depend strongli on the initi estim of weight and the number of unit in the hidden layer
thi work present a new method for the initi of weight and definit of the number of hidden unit in the identif of multipl input singl output model associ with regress problem
the initi strategi consist of a complet linear of the network with onli one neuron unit around an equilibrium point and the determin of the initi weight through the maximum approxim of the linear model to the optim linear regressor whose solut can be obtain analyt
the construct algorithm perform a gradual increas in the number of hidden unit in such a way that at each train onli weight associ with new hidden unit are randomli initi while weight obtain from previou train are use as initi guess for the subsequ one
the propos method wa compar to the classic random initi method and to the extrem learn machin a typic gradient-fre learn algorithm both of which also involv a construct approach to defin the final network
the method were appli to 11 real dataset wide use as benchmark for regress problem
the propos method perform better than the other approach in 8 9 case studi and wa abl to ensur a monoton decreas in the loss function with an increas number of hidden unit .
