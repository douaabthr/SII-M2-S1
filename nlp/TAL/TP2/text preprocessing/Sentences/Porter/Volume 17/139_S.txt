on the comput of delaunay triangul via genet algorithm
in thi work we introduc a new approach for comput delaunay triangul
delaunay triangul have numer applic in geoloc commun and other ict system or practic applic
have avail variou type of approach for comput such structur is rather desir from an implement and comput point of view
we adopt genet algorithm for comput delaunay triangul and present the design and evalu of our novel approach
we consid a set of point in the plane as vertic and connect them with edg creat the point graph
we have develop in c an applic framework base on genet algorithm calleddelaunay_genet which produc the delaunay triangul structur of a given set of point in the plane . delaunay_geneticconsid a novel graph-bas chromosom represent of desir solut creat an initi popul of individu chromosom an initi gener and produc from the origin popul gener new gener of individu in each repetit of the genet process of reproduct
each new gener emerg more robust than the previou one
our evalu have reveal that the delaunay triangul yield bydelaunay_genet achiev an accuraci of 98 100% of the optim delaunay triangul while maintain good converg speed
despit it limit in comput time and space the propos novel approach exhibit sever complementari benefit to comput geometri base approach such as allow the insert of new point in the triangul dynam lead to seamless adapt to new condit parallel of the comput process and toler to nois regard the coordin of the point
therefor thi work provid a use altern approach for comput delaunay triangul .
