an advanc intellig mppt control strategi base on the imperialist competit algorithm and artifici neural network
the develop of a robust optim control techniqu which can handl numer nonlinear system problem is one of the most challeng aspect of scienc product
in thi studi hybrid intellig maximum power point track mppt control approach base on the imperialist competit algorithm ica and an adapt artifici neural network ann model is propos to solv the effici optim problem of photovolta pv system which are consid as one of the most demand sourc energi in the world
consequ a comparison between variou metaheurist algorithm base ann includ particl swarm optim grey wolf optim and whale optim algorithm is made for four distinct pv panel architectur to prove the effect of the suggest approach in the optim process base ica techniqu and in the train phase base three train algorithm name bayesian regular br levenberg marquardt lm and scale conjug gradient scg
accordingli the obtain outcom have proven that the ica ann approach-bas br algorithm outperform in three of four case the other techniqu by reach an accuraci that can go up to 99.9994%
in the second part of thi studi the evalu of the obtain find confirm that our propos model wa abl to track the maximum power point mpp faster with a respons time between 1.9 and 9.6 ms and effici higher than 99.9652% which is can up to 99.9984% and it ha shown excel remark stabil compar to the perturb observ increment conduct and the most appli metaheuristic-bas mppt techniqu that we have use to conduct the optim perform comparison .
