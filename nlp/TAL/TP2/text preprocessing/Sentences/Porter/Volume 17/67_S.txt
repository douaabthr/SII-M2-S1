perform analysi of metaheurist base hyperparamet optim for fraud transact detect
in recent year detect fraud transact ha becom a popular research topic becaus credit card fraud transact result in the loss of billion of dollar everi year
therefor the need for financi institut and bank to improv their fraud detect system is increas
financi institut are increasingli use data mine to develop fraud detect system that can detect and stop fraudul transact automat
from the standpoint of machin learn detect fraud transact is a binari classif problem
howev interpret is essenti for manag to have faith in the use model and to develop fraud prevent strategi
design an algorithm that can detect fraud transact is difficult and need a higher understand of each part of the process and a lot of time
howev hyperparamet optim use metaheurist techniqu reduc the understand and time need to handl thi issu
hyperparamet optim is a techniqu that is use to select the best hyperparamet that yield the highest perform
use a metaheurist approach ha mani advantag such as improv the perform of the machin learn model tayebi e facilit the usag of the machin learn model etc
our propos solut in thi work is to use metaheurist algorithm such as genet algorithm ga differenti evolut de artifici bee coloni algorithm abc grey wolf optim algorithm gwo particl swarm optim pso and teach learning-bas optim tlbo to optim hyperparamet and compar these algorithm with grid search method gs
the use machin learn model in thi studi are adaboost ad random forest rf logist regress lr support vector machin classifi svm k-nearest neighbor knn mlpclassier mlp and decis tree dt
to compar these optim we use the follow evalu metric accuraci recal f1-score precis and the area under the roc curv auc .
