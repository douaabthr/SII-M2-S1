fan a framework for featur select in sentiment classif use a modifi firefli algorithm
sentiment classif is a preval task in text mine in which a text classifi into posit neg or neutral class
sentiment classif is an essenti issu of decision-mak for peopl compani etc
featur select is the most influenti stage in sentiment classif
due to the np-hard natur of the problem and a huge of exist text the tradit featur select techniqu such as statist techniqu gener sub-optim solut
swarm intellig algorithm are extens devot to optim problem
these algorithm produc featur by increas the classif perform and decreas the comput complex and featur set size
in thi studi the author propos a framework use the modifi multi-object firefli algorithm name fan firefli algorithm naïv bay sentiment
the two target are decreas the naïv bay error classifi and the k-nearest neighbor
a neural network is use as the final classifi
the three dataset on movi review and twitter domain are appli to evalu the fan
the fan outperform it counterpart regard precis accuraci and recal
the fan yield 96.88% precis 97.65% accuraci and 96.54% recal .
