reduc task execut time in heterogen distribut system use improv coa algorithm
task schedul in heterogen distribut system is an np-complet problem which use exact algorithm it is not possibl to achiev the optim solut at the right time to solv it
in such case meta-heurist algorithm can be effect
on the other hand in the matter of schedul creat a balanc between maxim parallel and minim commun cost is one of the main goal
in thi paper an improv coa algorithm ha been use to schedul task in heterogen distribut system and to increas parallel and reduc commun cost
the improv coa algorithm consid a larger number of egg for the sampl that ha the highest fit after the cuckoo lay stage and the sampl are identifi
three standard graph fft gaussian and molecular were use to evalu the propos model
experiment result indic that slr speedup and perform have improv with map in these three standard graph
the result total show 5.91% improv compar the moscoa 4.4% compar ega-t and also 3.86% compar e-coa so they show that improv the abov criteria lead to reduc the total execut time and improv the perform of the coa algorithm .
