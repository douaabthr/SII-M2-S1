optim of activ power dispatch consid unifi power flow control applic of evolutionari algorithm in a fuzzi framework
thi paper present an optim activ power dispatch oapd problem that unlik common econom dispatch problem preclud unwant mismatch on realist power system
the oapd is formul by consid the unifi power flow control upfc a versatil devic from the flexibl ac transmiss system
howev the result turn into a highli nonlinear and complex optim problem which requir a power evolutionari algorithm to determin the optim solut
toward thi end thi paper explor the use of comprehens learn particl swarm optim and differenti evolut as ahybrid configurationin a fuzzi framework call hybrid fuzzy-bas improv comprehens learn particl swarm optimization-differenti evolut to address the propos problem
to demonstr the perform of the propos algorithm a set of benchmark problem includ real-world constrain optim problem as well as a profound analysi of schwefel problem 2.26 are provid
moreov to authent it effect in solv power and energy-rel problem with quit a few decis variabl four differ power system 3 unit 6 unit ieee 30 bu 10 unit and 40 unit system are implement
the ieee 30 bu system is opt for profoundli analyz the perform of the propos algorithm in handl the optim power dispatch problem consid secur constraint and upfc devic where an enhanc at least 74,000 save in a 365 day horizon in total gener cost is obtain
simul result also valid that evolutionari algorithm need to beimproved/hybridizedto achiev betterequilibriumbetweenexplor and exploitationprocess in a time manner while solv power and energy-rel problem .
