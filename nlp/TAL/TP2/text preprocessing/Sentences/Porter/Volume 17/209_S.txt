a multi-task meta-learner-bas ensembl for robust facial express recognit in-the-wild
facial express recognit is a topic of signific interest in affect comput
howev prior dataset and studi have primarili focus on recogn facial express in control environ limit their generaliz to realist context
thu despit recent advanc recogn facial express accur in wild scenario remain a challeng task
in thi work we propos an ensembl model base on multi-task meta-learn that util a pool of cnn classifi while dynam select and fuse the optim ensembl in order to recogn facial express more effect in the wild
the suggest scheme leverag the output probabl of base learner as meta-featur and integr multi-label classif into dynam ensembl select
as best as we know thi is the first investig of multi-task learn at the meta-learn level in the context of facial express recognit
in particular we introduc an effect meta-learn that combin the strength of stack and dynam ensembl select
the propos approach ha been evalu exhaust on sever challeng dataset includ raf-db fer2013 and ferplu and the obtain result demonstr that the ensembl cnn outperform individu cnn model consist while achiev high perform across all dataset
we further demonstr the generaliz of the propos approach by perform cross-dataset evalu .
