a dynam tri-popul multi-object evolutionari algorithm for constrain multi-object optim problem
balanc between the converg feasibl and divers of the popul is the key to solv constrain multi-object optim problem cmop
howev the exist constrain multi-object optim evolutionari algorithm cmoea face challeng in converg to the constrain pareto front cpf with well-distribut feasibl solut
to address thi issu thi paper propos a dynam tri-popul multi-object evolutionari algorithm call tdpscmo
in the initi phase the first and second popul evolv dynam to solv the origin cmop and the unconstrain multi-object optim problem mop
thi dynam offspr gener emphas converg and feasibl
in the later stage the alloc of comput resourc to the first popul is adjust base on the variat in offspr number
simultan a third popul is introduc to enhanc popul divers by treat constraint violat degre as an addit object function thu captur more valuabl inform
the perform of tdpscmo is further test through 57 benchmark test problem and 21 real-world applic use sever state-of-the-art algorithm
the result show the competit of the propos algorithm when address cmop .
