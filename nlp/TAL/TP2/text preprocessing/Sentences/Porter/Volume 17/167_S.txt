quantum-inspir meta-heurist approach for a constrain portfolio optim problem
portfolio optim ha long been a challeng proposit and a wide studi topic in financ and manag
it involv select and alloc the right asset accord to the desir object
it ha been found that thi nonlinear constraint problem cannot be effect solv use a tradit approach
thi paper cover and compar quantum-inspir version of four popular evolutionari techniqu with three benchmark dataset
genet algorithm differenti evolut particl swarm optim ant coloni optim and their quantum-inspir incarn are implement and the result are compar
experi have been carri out with more than 10 year of stock price data from nasdaq bse and dow jone
thi work propos sever enhanc to alloc fund effici such as improv crossov techniqu and dynam and adapt select of paramet
furthermor it is observ that the quantum-inspir techniqu outperform the classic counterpart .
