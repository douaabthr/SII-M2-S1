optim for cost-effect design of water distribut network a comprehens learn approach
the comprehens learn gravit search algorithm clgsa ha demonstr it effect in solv continu optim problem
in thi research we extend the clgsa to tackl np-hard combinatori problem and introduc the discret comprehens learn gravit search algorithm d-clgsa
the d-clgsa framework incorpor a refin posit and veloc updat scheme tailor for discret problem
to evalu the algorithm s effici we conduct two set of experi
firstli we assess it perform on a divers rang of 24 benchmark encompass unimod multimod composit and special discret function
secondli we appli the d-clgsa to a practic optim problem involv water distribut network plan and manag
the d-clgsa model wa coupl with the hydraul simul solver epanet to identifi the optim design for the water distribut network aim for cost-effect
we evalu the model s perform on six distribut network name two-loop network hanoi network new-york citi network goyang network bakryun network and balerma network
the result of our studi were promis surpass previou studi in the field
consequ the d-clgsa model hold great potenti as an optim for econom and reliabl plan and manag water network .
