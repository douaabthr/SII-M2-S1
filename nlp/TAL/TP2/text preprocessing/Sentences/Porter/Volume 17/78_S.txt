an evolutionari multitask optim algorithm via reference-point base nondomin sort approach
multiobject multifactori evolutionari algorithm momfea which solv multipl task simultan base on a singl popul ha receiv consider attent in recent decad
howev the neg transmiss usual lead to slower converg or wors distribut
to make use of the potenti similar between differ task thi paper propos an enhanc version for the momfea use a reference-point base nondomin sort approach denot as mfea-rp
by use multipl dimension scale subtask in differ dimens can be optim simultan with a singl set of refer point
the effici of the method is substanti by multiobject benchmark problem and practic instanc
in most of the test probabl mfea-rp converg faster to the true pareto front
better-distribut solut are success found which indic the better repres to the solut space .
