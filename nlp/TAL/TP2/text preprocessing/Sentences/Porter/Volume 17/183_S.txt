cooper coevolutionari differenti evolut with adjac intens matrix with linkag identif for large-scal optim problem in noisi environ
thi paper propos a novel decomposit method name adjac intens matrix with linkag identif ali which collabor with the cooper coevolut cc framework to solv large-scal optim problem lsop in noisi environ
convent differenti group dg base method in the cc framework can detect the interact by the absolut interact intens
in noisi environ the uncertainti of fit will be amplifi and the absolut interact intens is easili larger than the threshold which result in all decis variabl be group into one compon
although it is difficult to detect interact through absolut interact intens in noisi environ the rel differ between separ and non-separ decis variabl may exist which can help us determin the separ to form the sub-compon
we propos the adjac intens matrix aim by an addit identif criterion and determin the signific intens si to classifi the interact by learn the regular of intens
sinc the convent perform indic of decomposit accuraci da cannot fulli reflect the inner structur of a non-separ sub-compon we introduc a more rigor metric to evalu the decomposit name the similar of depend structur matrix s_ dsm
in the optim phase after the decomposit we employ an advanc optim name modifi differenti evolut with distance-bas select mde-d to adapt to noisi environ
experiment result on the cec2013 suit with nois show that our propos ha a broad prospect to solv lsop in noisi environ .
