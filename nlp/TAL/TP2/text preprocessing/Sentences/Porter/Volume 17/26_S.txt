distribut locat margin price comput base on activ power loss and emiss in activ distribut system use nucleolu theori
in thi studi a nucleolu theori nt base iter method ha been present to comput distribut locat margin price dlmp at buse where embed gener eg unit were instal in the distribut network
the nt-base iter method provid financi incent to eg owner as per their contribut to loss reduct and emiss reduct for specifi load condit
in thi studi dlmp valu depend on the decision-mak prefer among loss reduct emiss reduct and distribut compani addit benefit
the main object of the propos method is to optim the activ power loss and emiss base on disco decision-mak prioriti subject to eg capac
dlmp valu for each eg unit is a variabl that ha to comput base on disco decision-mak prioriti
thi propos nt base iter method ha been implement on taiwan power compani distribut system tpcd consist of 84 buse with 15 eg unit and 201 bu radial distribut network with 15 eg unit under matlab environ and comput dlmp valu base on the contribut of eg unit on loss and emiss reduct
it wa infer from the result that the propos method enabl eg owner to receiv more financi benefit and also enabl disco decision-mak can oper the network with more optim in term of loss and emiss .
