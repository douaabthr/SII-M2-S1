fire and manoeuvr optim for flow shop schedul problem
the purpos of thi paper is to introduc a new rich sourc of idea and techniqu that could be use to build new algorithm capabl to solv numer encount optimis problem in differ field of scienc and engin
the art of war is one of the most rich disciplin in term of alreadi experi strategi and tactic that can inspir research to design new power and effici metaheurist
the framework of the propos method are inspir by the main war phase and contain seven compon initi intellig concept suppress advanc assault and exploit
the basic fire and manoeuvr tactic is adopt in the suppress and advanc phase
the propos fire and manoeuvr algorithm fma is a hybrid of a greedi algorithm with a multi-neighbour search procedur
the develop algorithm ha been employ to minim makespan of the classic flow shop schedul problem
a mathemat model is present to describ the studi optimis problem
compar experi on taillard s data set confirm that the fma result are more accur than alreadi publish data
a comparison between the fma and other popular nature-inspir algorithm ha been conduct
it wa reveal that the propos metaheurist outperform the classic genet algorithm the migrat bird optimis and the whale optimis algorithm .
