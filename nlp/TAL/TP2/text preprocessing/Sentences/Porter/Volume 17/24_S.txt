research on uncertain bi-object uav mission alloc problem
base on the uncertainti theori thi paper studi the uncertain bi-object uav mission alloc problem in uncertain environ
firstli by regard uncertainti factor in the mission alloc plan as uncertain variabl and consid two mission of combat mission gain and flight fuel consumpt a uncertain bi-object uav mission alloc ubuma model is establish
secondli in order to overcom the disconnect between the object function caus by the tradit method to deal with uncertain factor thi paper propos a so-cal uncertain method to solv ubmua problem by defin the relationship of order between uncertain variabl
accord the real decision-mak process the ubuma is transform into a single-object program problem by use c_e principl relat
final the ant algorithm is employ to solv the single-object program problem and then the c_e effici mission rout are obtain
the simul result show that thi method can effect deal with ubuma problem and the mission alloc effici rout is reason .
