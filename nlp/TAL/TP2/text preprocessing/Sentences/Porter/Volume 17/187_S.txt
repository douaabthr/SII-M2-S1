a novel giant pacif octopu optim for real-world engin problem
giant pacif octopu optim gpoo a new swarm computational-intellig metaheurist approach is a natur algorithm base on the behavior of octopus as they struggl to live in the environ
the gpoo model which are two primari techniqu search and attack prey are offer for algorithm optim
the transit between the explor and exploit stage are handl in a way that strike an appropri balanc
a numer of test are carri out to verifi the novel optim process s capac to identifi the best solut to differ optim issu
the gpoo model is evalu use 10 complex benchmark function for cec2019 and 23 classic benchmark function
addit the result are compar to other metaheurist algorithm
global algorithm are also employ to address practic engin technic issu
the outcom show that gpoo demonstr other compar method in term of converg speed and success locat all or most local/glob optima .
