the novel multi-swarm coyot optim algorithm for automat skin lesion segment
coyot optim algorithm coa is one of population-bas swarm intellig algorithm inspir by the swarm behavior of coyot
howev coa show it effect in solv the global optim problem it suffer from prematur converg and stagnat in local optima espici in a complex space
in thi paper the multi-swarm topolog is employ where the popul is divid into sever sub-swarm
the perform of multi-swarm coyot optim algorithm mcoa is evalu on a set of benchmark function provid in the ieee cec 2005 and ieee cec 2017 special session
also it is evalu for solv multi-level threshold problem where 44 skin dermoscop imag obatin from ph2 benchmark dataset are use
the experiment result show that employ mutli-swarm topolog can significantli improv the popul divers and thu the explor abil
also the result reveal that propos mcoa ha the advantag of remark stabil and high accuraci compar with it classic version and other state-of-art meta-heurist optim algorithm
addit a new skin lesion segment model base on mcoa is propos as well
the result illustr the effect and effici of the propos model and it can be further use for skin diseas diagnosi and treatment plan .
