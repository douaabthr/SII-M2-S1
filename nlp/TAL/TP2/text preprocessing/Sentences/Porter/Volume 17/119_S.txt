re-formul snowflak optim algorithm sfo-r
model snowflak movement as an optim algorithm is a recent propos idea with a straightforward formul
in thi paper we propos to use differ formul for the movement of the snowflak and present a new nature-inspir optim algorithm base on the same phenomenon
the algorithm is base on the forc that affect a snowflak dure the snowfal and the collis between them
we test the algorithm on three benchmark set cec 2017 cec 2020 and cec 2011 and compar it perform with pso woa bbo gwo bat and mfo in solv these three benchmark set
we evalu the result both statist and with the wilcoxon signed-rank test
the evalu shown that the propos algorithm ha well-balanc explor and exploit abil and outperform the other algorithm for all the comparison criteria except the execut time
also the pairwis comparison indic that it is more stabl than the other algorithm in solv cec 2017 and cec 2020 benchmark problem .
