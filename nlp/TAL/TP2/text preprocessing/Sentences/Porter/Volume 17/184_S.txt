unveil the many-object dragonfli algorithm s maoda efficaci in complex optim
in the field of multi-object optim algorithm moa a primari challeng is identifi an optim solut that effect converg to the true pareto front while maintain a high level of divers especi in the initi phase of evolut
to tackl thi challeng thi studi introduc a novel algorithm name many-object dragonfli algorithm maoda
thi method incorpor refer point nich preserv and inform feedback mechan for maintain better balanc between converg and divers
through thi studi the maoda effect is establish by use the wfg1-wfg9 test suit for 4 6 and 8 object and five real-world rwmaop1 rwmaop5 design problem
the find demonstr that maoda outperform it peer many-object algorithm like maotlbo maojaya maopso and nsga-iii in most test scenario in term of gd igd sp sd hv and rt metric
it is shown that maoda achiev better converg as well as enhanc divers and spread compar to peer .
