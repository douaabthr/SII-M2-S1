intent recognit of aerial target base on deep learn
three air target intent recognit method base on deep learn are propos to realiz the function of recogn air target intent base on real-tim situat inform to resolv the problem that pilot cannot effect observ and analyz observ within a short period of time in complex air battlefield environ and tradit air target intent recognit algorithm have shortcom such as complex featur filter and relianc on expert experi
the method use expert experi to simul combat in the air on the simul platform we design obtain and filter key postur inform of aerial target and correspond expert script intent label dure combat and send them to a design full connect network a convolut neural network and a recurr neural network for train
the train result show that all three network can achiev air target intent recognit and the recurr neural network base model can achiev the intent recognit with an accuraci of 80%
compar with tradit method such as d- infer the propos method is more gener and robust
final the feasibl and effect of the method we propos is verifi by the simul and experi .
