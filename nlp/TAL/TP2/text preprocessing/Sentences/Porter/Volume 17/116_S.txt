a novel two-stag bio-inspir method use red deer algorithm for data cluster
data cluster is a method of divid data point into similar group
in the last few decad there have been numer advanc in algorithm and methodolog for the analysi of cluster data
although some algorithm likek-mean due to their easi implement and interpret are wide use for cluster their capabl of provid good solut might be sensit to the number of dimens and cluster
due to the advantag of metaheuristic-bas cluster approach like strong searchabl they have been wide use to tackl the cluster problem
base on thi premis we propos a new bio-inspir red deer cluster algorithm rdca
red deer algorithm rda is a new metaheurist inspir by the behavior of the scottish red deer dure a breed season
first the data space is partit into sever divis each of which is repres by a disjunct normal form express use cliqu algorithm
then a search strategi employ a modifi version of rda is pursu
experi are carri out to assess the perform of rdca in comparison to eight tradit method use six real-world and three gener dataset in term of cluster valid measur name compact separ combin turi davi bouldin and normal mutual inform score
the propos method can handl multipl object function simultan and show good perform when the data dimens is larg
the result indic that in most scenario the propos method outperform it counterpart
it is also shown that the propos algorithm is less sensit to increas the number of cluster and dimens .
