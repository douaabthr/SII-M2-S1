topolog local approach for effici energi manag of wsn
the energi manag problem is an inevit issu with the wireless sensor network wsn
there is alway a need for an energy-consci model for wsn that will prolong the network lifetim dure system execut
commonli the wsn is distribut in natur as it is use for sever applic like local surveil and object track
in such a scenario energi manag is even more critic
in thi regard we propos an energy-effici topolog local techniqu call clock local approach cla that ensur a long lifetim of wsn by elimin recurr reclust and iter cluster head ch select
cla follow a clock pattern-bas sensor deploy strategi where the select ch play a dual role of ch and vice-ch
it help to reduc energi consumpt and overhead issu
the simul result show that the outperform of the cla algorithm in comparison to low-energi adapt cluster hierarchy-centr leach-c and base station control dynam cluster protocol bcdcp .
