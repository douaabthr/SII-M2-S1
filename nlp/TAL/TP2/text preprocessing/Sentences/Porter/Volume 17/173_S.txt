optim featur subset select for mri brain tumor classif use improv ant-lion optim
an accur diagnosi of the type of brain tumor is crucial for expert to choos the best cours of therapi and increas the patient s lifetim
the manual categor of brain tumor in magnet reson imag mri with similar structur or appear can be complex and reli on expertis
also brain mri contain a signific number of redund or irrelev featur and classif algorithm struggl to detect pattern without featur select
by select promin featur the machine-learn model can produc a high level of predict accuraci in medic diagnost problem
in thi paper an improv ant lion optim approach ialo is develop to select the optim featur for wrapper-mod classif
initi pre-process is carri out to remov bia and nois
tumor segment is perform use activ contour driven by laplacian of gaussian energi and optim region scalabl fit energi
from the segment brain imag hand-craft featur are extract use the histogram of orient gradient gray level co-occurr matrix gray level run length matrix and deep featur are extract use the resnet50
the propos ialo is employ for the select of the best featur from handcraft and deep featur
the final step wa to classifi brain tumor use support vector machin naiv bay and recurr neural network
the propos ialo-bas rnn exhibit enhanc accuraci of 99.59% for brat and 99.18% for j. cheng brain imag respect
from the experiment result it is observ that our propos model outperform the exist metaheurist optim algorithm and effect remov the least signific featur while improv classif accuraci .
