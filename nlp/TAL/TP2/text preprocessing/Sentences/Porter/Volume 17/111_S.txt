an insight on recent advanc and futur perspect in detect techniqu of parkinson s diseas
parkinson s diseas ha no specif test for diagnosi which is usual detect through a review of sign and symptom like tremor stiff and slow of movement
over the past 10 15 year variou method were propos that use motor sign and voic data for the accur detect of parkinson s diseas pd
cutting-edg technolog like machin learn deep learn imag process and sever signal process mechan were employ in the effici diagnosi of pd
in view of thi we present a structur review of such techniqu
in the ongo research over the past few year variou dataset were gener to assess pd with the salient paramet of the voic signal acquir from healthi peopl and pd patient
also tremor and gait data were collect by record the movement of pd patient from sens unit such as acceleromet gyroscop and inerti measur unit sensor
an overal analysi ha been done on the variou techniqu with respect to the voic dataset and motion sensor data
a detail analysi suggest that machin and deep learn approach are optimist in develop clinic applic .
