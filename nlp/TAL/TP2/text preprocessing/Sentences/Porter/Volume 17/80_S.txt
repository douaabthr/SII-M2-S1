an economic/emiss dispatch base on a new multi-object artifici bee coloni optim algorithm and nsga-ii
the convent energi resourc have limit reserv and their util is advers affect the environ
henc it is necessari to gener electr with the least cost and emiss
the studi in the past reveal that the combin econom emiss dispatch ceed problem ha been solv by evolutionari and swarm intelligence-bas optim algorithm
howev the methodolog to identifi the best compromis solut for the ceed problem ha not been studi much in the literatur
in thi paper a multi-object optim algorithm which reduc fuel cost of power gener as well as emiss simultan is present
the algorithm is a combin of an artifici bee coloni algorithm abc and a non-domin sort genet algorithm nsga-ii with a new constraint handl featur
to valid the effect of the propos algorithm it is appli to three benchmark system commonli use to studi the effect of optim algorithm
moreov the best compromis solut obtain by the propos algorithm is identifi by use sixteen multi-attribut decision-mak madm method
the non-domin solut report in the past literatur for differ test system are also analys use madm method
it ha been shown that the propos algorithm give better result without violat the constraint and with the minimum number of iter .
