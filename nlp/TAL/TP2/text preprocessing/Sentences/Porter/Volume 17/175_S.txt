posit of new mobil tower use circl pack problem
the circl pack problem determin a circl of the largest area that can fit into the vacant space when varvec n arbitrary-s non-overlap given circl are place insid a given contain
one of it numer applic is to determin the optim posit of mobil tower in a citi
thi constrain nonlinear optim problem is solv use four variant of the real code genet algorithm
these four variant are creat by the combin of two well-known real-cod crossov oper arithmet crossov and hybrid crossov and two well-known real-cod mutat oper uniform mutat and discret uniform mutat
the perform of these algorithm is evalu use the mean standard deviat best worst of the object function valu and friedman s mean rank test is appli when 30 run of each variant are carri out
on the basi of the comput analysi the perform of the variant of rcga have arithmet crossover-uniform mutat ax-um outperform all other rcga consid in thi studi in term of faster converg and better accuraci of the solut
in a practic demonstr thi methodolog is implement to a case studi in roorke citi in uttarakhand of northen india
current there are 14 exist mobil tower in roorke citi
howev there are certain region in which internet connect is unsatisfactori
therefor base on the recommend of thi studi ax-um is recommend to instal three new mobil tower .
