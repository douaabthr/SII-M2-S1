optim convolut neural network use elitist firefli algorithm for remot sens classif
thi articl explor the applic of a new optim convolut neural network cnn to segment remot sens
the paper design a modifi version of the firefli algorithm to provid an optim structur of the cnn
the method is then appli to segment the remote-sens imag
the author compar the propos method with sever other architectur on two multispectr remot sens dataset evalu model perform and accuraci
the find demonstr that the project cnn method provid the most effici outcom and can be a viabl option for remot sens analysi and classif due to their rel eas of train and high accuraci rate
furthermor the author discuss the potenti for further request of cnn in remot sens statist analysi .
