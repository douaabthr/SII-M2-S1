to valid the effect of the propos runge-qdopp method thirty-four multidimension optim benchmark problem compris of unimod and multimod test function with variou dimension have been solv and the correspond result are compar against the predict obtain from the other opposition-bas learn variant as well as some state-of-art literatur optim
furthermor six constrain engin design problem with differ function characterist have been solv and the respect result are benchmark against those obtain for the well-known optim
comparison of the solut outcom with literatur optim for constrain and unconstrain test problem reveal that the propos qdopp ha signific advantag over it counterpart regard solut accuraci and effici .
