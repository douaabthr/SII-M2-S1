a new evolutionari neural network base on intrus detect system use locust swarm optim
the need to avoid comput system breach is increas
mani research have adopt differ approach such as intrus detect system idss to handl variou threat
intrus detect ha becom an imper system to detect variou secur breach
until today research face the problem of build reliabl and effect idss that can handl numer attack with chang pattern
thi paper deal with feed-forward neural network fnn train problem use the applic of a recent invent meta-heurist optim algorithm locust swarm optim lso for the first time
fnn is combin with lso fnn-lso to build an advanc detect system and improv the perform of id
our method is appli to a seri of experi to studi the capabl and perform of the propos approach
experiment studi began by use intrus detect evalu data name nsl-kdd and unsw-nb15 to benchmark the perform of the propos approach
the most common evolutionari trainer name particl swarm optim pso-bas trainer and genet algorithm ga-bas trainer were implement to verifi the result
compar with exist method in the literatur our propos approach provid to be more accur to be an altern solut for id
the experiment result show that our train algorithm not onli attain a veri good perform in term of speed converg but also achiev reliabl due to the reduc likelihood of be trap in local minima
furthermor our propos model improv the detect rate .
