a new genet optim tensor product function link neural network an applic to the daili exchang rate forecast
the train speed for multilay neural network is slow due to the multilay
therefor remov the hidden layer provid that the input layer is endow with addit higher order unit is suggest to avoid such problem
tensor product function link neural network tpflnn is a singl layer with higher order term that extend the network s structur by introduc supplementari input to the network i.e. joint activ
although the structur of the tpflnn is simpl it suffer from weight combinatori explos problem when it order becom excess high
furthermor similarli to mani neural network method select of proper weight is one of the most challeng issu in the tpflnn
find suitabl weight could help to reduc the number of need weight
therefor in thi studi the genet algorithm ga wa use to find near-optimum weight for the tpflnn
the propos method is abbrevi as ga tpflnn
the ga tpflnn wa use to forecast the daili exchang rate for the euro/u dollar and japanes yen/u dollar
simul result show that the ga tpflnn produc more accur forecast as compar to the standard tpflnn ga ga tpflnn with backpropag ga-funct expans flnn multilay perceptron support vector regress random forest for regress and naiv method
the ga help the tpflnn to find low complex network structur and/or near-optimum paramet which lead to thi better result .
