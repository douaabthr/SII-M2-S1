the anglerfish algorithm a deriv of random increment construct techniqu for solv the travel salesman problem
combinatori optim focus on arriv at a global optim solut given constraint incomplet inform and limit comput resourc
the combin of possibl solut are rather vast and often overwhelm the limit comput power
smart algorithm have been develop to address thi issu
each offer a more effici way of travers the search landscap
critic have call for a realign in the bio-inspir metaheurist field
we propos an algorithm that simplifi the search oper to onli random popul initi follow the random increment construct techniqu which essenti compartment optim into smaller sub-unit
thi reliev the need of complex oper normal impos on the current metaheurist pool
the algorithm is more gener and adapt to ani optim problem
benchmark is conduct use the travel salesman problem
the result are compar with the result of advanc metaheurist algorithm
henc suggest that arbitrari explor is practic as an oper to solv optim problem .
