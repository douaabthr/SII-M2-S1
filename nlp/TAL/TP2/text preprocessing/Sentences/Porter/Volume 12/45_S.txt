spectrum sens in cognit radio network use kernel recurs least squar
cognit radio cr environ help in solv the spectrum scarciti by predict the avail channel through the cooper spectrum sens
spectrum sens is consid to be one of the prime task in cr environ and mani research have contribut for the same
in thi paper a cooper spectrum sens css environ for the cr ha been develop to determin the channel avail for the commun
here a predict model name hybrid cooper spectrum sens hkrl ha been propos for detect the channel avail
initi a hybrid mixtur model is develop by deriv the eigen statist of the cr environ and the statist are provid to the hkrl predictor
the propos hkrl predict algorithm is an improv over the kernel recurs least squar krl as the propos algorithm contain sever kernel function for the predict
the propos hkrl model is implement by consid four differ channel for the simul and evalu base on metric such as probabl of detect and probabl of the fals alarm
the simul result of the propos hkrl scheme is compar with other compar model and the result prove that the model achiev improv channel estim .
