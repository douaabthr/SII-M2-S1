a risk-driven multi-object evolutionari approach for select softwar requir
explor iter and increment approach current softwar project defin variou deliveri releas which ought to be develop within budgetari constraint but rais custom satisfact as much as possibl
in search base softwar engin such a problem is refer to as next releas problem nrp in which the select of softwar requir for the next releas is reformul as an optim problem
more recent nrp propos have evolv to a multi-object perspect provid non-domin recommend that balanc the trade-off surfac with respect to custom satisfact and develop cost
despit key advanc in nrp propos most of them do not deal with softwar risk which repres a vital aspect that can deepli impact on project cost and custom satisfact
in such a direct use multi-object evolutionari algorithm moea thi paper propos and evalu a risk-driven systemat approach for the nrp problem in which a risk analysi is incorpor for estim the impact of softwar risk in develop cost and custom satisfact
by contrast three differ well-known moea empir result base on two semi-r dataset reveal the potenti effici and practic applic bring not onli more realist precis and meaning estim but also find a signific percentag of unanticip solut .
