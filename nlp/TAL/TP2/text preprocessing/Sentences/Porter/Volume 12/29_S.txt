short-term electr load forecast method base on stack auto-encod and gru neural network
with the rapid develop of smart grid to solv the power enterpris requir in short-term load forecast thi paper propos a short-term electr load forecast method base on stack auto-encod and gru gate recurr unit neural network
firstli the method input histor data which contain power load weather inform and holiday inform and use auto-encod to compress the histor data and then the multi-lay gru is use to construct the model to predict the power load
the experi result show compar with tradit model the propos method can effect predict the daili variat of power load and have lower predict error and higher precis .
