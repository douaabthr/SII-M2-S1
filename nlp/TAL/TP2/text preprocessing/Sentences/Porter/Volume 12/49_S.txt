optim fopid/pid control paramet tune for the avr system base on sine cosine-algorithm
to enhanc the control perform an advanc sine cosine-algorithm sca is employ for fraction order pid fopid control tune in thi paper
the sca-fopid control is base on model-bas control design method of physic system to get better perform
the fopid control is design by sca optim techniqu use the time domain object function for avr system
the sca techniqu is respons to optim five paramet of fopid control base on minimum valu of object function of the control design
the propos sca-fopid control is design at a global optimum of object function is acheiv
then the avr system ha good regul of termin voltag at the output to meet desir perform
the propos method ha a good refer track abil and frequenc respons
thi method is compar with the pid and fopid control design of avr system in the recent year the propos sca-fopid control give an excel perform from the extens simul studi .
