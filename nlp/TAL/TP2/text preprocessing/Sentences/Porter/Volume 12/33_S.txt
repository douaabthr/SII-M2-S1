implement of self adapt mutat factor and cross-ov probabl base differenti evolut algorithm for node local in wireless sensor network
node local or posit is essenti for mani posit awar protocol in a wireless sensor network
the classic global poison system use for node local is limit becaus of it high cost and it unavail in the indoor environ
so sever local algorithm have been propos in the recent past to improv local accuraci and to reduc implement cost
one of the popular approach of local is to defin local as a least squar local lsl problem
dure optim of lsl problem the perform of the classic gauss newton method is limit becaus it can be trap by local minima
by contrast differenti evolut de algorithm ha high local accuraci becaus it ha an abil to determin global optim solut to the lsl problem
howev the converg speed of the convent de algorithm is low as it use fix valu of mutat factor and cross-ov probabl
thu in thi paper a self-adapt mutat factor cross-ov probabl base differenti evolut sa-mcd algorithm is propos for lsl problem to improv converg speed
the sa-mcd algorithm adapt adjust the mutat factor and cross-ov probabl in each gener to better explor and exploit the global optim solut
thu improv local accuraci with high converg speed is expect from the sa-mcd algorithm
the rigor simul result conduct for sever local algorithm declar that the propos sa-mcd base local ha about 40 90 more local accuraci over the classic techniqu .
