an augment anim migrat optim algorithm use worst solut elimin approach in the backdrop of differenti evolut
a new algorithm ha been formul base on the basic anim migrat optim amo algorithm
dure the cours of thi propos work it wa reveal for the first time that amo algorithm is a true replica of degl algorithm and when mathemat analysi wa carri out the similar were brought to notic which wa till date not report
further dure the investig it wa also wit that amo algorithm in it virgin form is capabl of deliv a competit perform when appli to optim of non-linear function refer to cec 2014 test suit
such success achiev use basic amo algorithm inspir the present author to take it as a challeng for explor the possibl of improv the convent amo algorithm with an object of provid it with a new shape and build an effici framework for tackl the handicap encount in origin amo algorithm
in fact the incess quest of modifi the basic algorithm gave birth to a new algorithm known as augment anim migrat optim algorithm in the backdrop of differenti evolut aamo-d
the propos algorithm even though incorpor the philosophi of jaya algorithm it creat a memori hierarchi of worst solut gener in each iter
and unlik jaya algorithm where the posit updat equat employ the current worst solut the propos one pick up a random worst solut from the archiv to achiev better divers and also drop the global best term which often yield bias solut
the propos aamo-d algorithm could accomplish highli encourag result when cec 2014 test suit problem were subject to valid check
the perform of the propos algorithm wa truli impress in comparison with it counterpart compris of state-of-the-art algorithm
in case of applic to real world engin problem the outcom were veri promis and realli prove that the propos aamo-d algorithm is not onli a strong contend in the optim commun exhibit excel result but is also a potenti robust algorithm and ha the abil to converg toward global optima without be trap in local minima as evid from test exampl .
