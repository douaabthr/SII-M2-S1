multiobject environment adapt method for solv environmental/econom dispatch problem
environment adapt method is one of the evolutionari algorithm for solv singl object optim problem
although the algorithm converg veri fast and produc diversifi solut there are three weak in it
in thi paper first we have given the solut to resolv these weak and then we have extend the modifi method to deal with multipl conflict object simultan
a permutation-bas multiobject environment adapt method pmoeam ha been suggest to solv the environmental/econom dispatch eed problem of the power system
in thi paper total gener cost and environment emiss have been taken as two object that need to be minim simultan while meet the load demand under equal and inequ constraint
three test system are consid to evalu the perform of the propos algorithm
the perform of the suggest algorithm is compar against five multiobject algorithm
extens experiment result demonstr that the pmoeam method can obtain effect and feasibl solut for eed problem .
