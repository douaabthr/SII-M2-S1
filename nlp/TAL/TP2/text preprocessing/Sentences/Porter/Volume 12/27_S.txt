a ga sourc local algorithm base on nl initi optim of particl filter
a ga sourc local algorithm base on the initi nl valu optim of particl filter pf-nl is propos to solv the problem that the posit accuraci of nl algorithm is reduc due to rough initi valu estim and improp weight alloc of node
firstli the state space model of the system is establish by use the ga turbul diffus model the particl weight is updat by construct the likelihood function and then the initi posit and initi sourc strength of the ga sourc are obtain by use the nl algorithm
final the true inform of the ga sourc is accur estim by use the pf-nl algorithm
the simul result show that compar with nl the algorithm ha higher posit accuraci further improv the converg speed of the algorithm by optim the initi valu and can be well appli to practic scenario .
