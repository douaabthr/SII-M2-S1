a histogram base fuzzi ensembl techniqu for featur select
featur select fs is an integr part of mani machin learn problem in provid a better and time-effici classif model
in recent time mani new fs algorithm have been propos which combin well-establish algorithm to overcom drawback of the constitu algorithm
the gener process of combin is to allow them to oper consecut or simultan
these rudimentari combin in mani case do not allow for proper inclus of the advantag of the specif algorithm and thi necessit an altern approach for combin
initi without interrupt the flow of the algorithm we allow them to gener their result
after select of the most domin featur the rest of the combin is done use the concept of histogram and assign a weightag to the fuzzi featur base on the qualiti of the candid solut in which they appear
in the propos method the outcom of the three popularli use algorithm with complementari exploit explor trade-off name genet algorithm ga binari particl swarm optimis bpso and ant coloni optimis aco are combin togeth
then 14 popular uci dataset have been use to evalu the propos fs method
result obtain by our propos ensembl are compar with some popular fs model like gravit search algorithm histogram base multi object ga ga bpso and aco and it show that our algorithm outperform the other .
