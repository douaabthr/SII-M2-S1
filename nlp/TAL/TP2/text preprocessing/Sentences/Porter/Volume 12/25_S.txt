imbalanc data classif algorithm with support vector machin kernel extens
learn from the imbalanc data sampl so as to achiev accur classif is an import research content in data mine field
it is veri difficult for classif algorithm to achiev a higher accuraci becaus the uneven distribut of data sampl make some categori have few sampl
a imbalanc data classif algorithm of support vector machin ke-svm is propos in thi articl thi algorithm achiev the initi classif of data sampl by train the maximum margin classif svm model and then obtain a new kernel extens function
base on chi squar test and weight coeffici calcul through train the sampl again by the new vector machin with kernel function to improv the classif accuraci
through the simul experi of real data set of artifici data set it show that the propos method ha higher classif accuraci and faster converg for the uneven distribut data .
