remov of rain video base on tempor intens and chromat constraint of raindrop
an improv algorithm of frame time differ is propos and appli to raindrop remov of video imag . thi paper analyz the tempor intens waveform and chromat constraint properti of raindrop and the method is optim by these two properti
we make use of the differ between rain and non-rain move object in the pixel intens chang which realiz a broad classif between the rain and non-rain move object pixel
the candid raindrop pixel are optim in combin with the chromat constraint properti
the experiment result show that the propos algorithm ha a better effect of raini day in video imag restor than garg s and it is simpl and effect
the algorithm ha a strong applic and it can be further use for mani applic such as air pollut control manag outdoor surveil remot sens and intellig vehicl .
