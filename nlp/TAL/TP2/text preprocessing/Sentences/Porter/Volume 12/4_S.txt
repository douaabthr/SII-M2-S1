an optim pid control for a bipe robot walk on flat terrain use mciwo algorithm
the design of appropri control play an import role in achiev the dynam balanc gait of the bipe robot
the present paper deal with the tune of gain kp kdandki of the propos pid control use two non-tradit global optim algorithm name particl swarm optim pso and a variant of invas weed optim iwo call modifi chaotic invas weed optim mciwo algorithm which is newli propos by the author
the effect of the newli propos mciwo algorithm ha been verifi with the help of benchmark function by conduct the normal test parametr and non-parametr test
further the develop mciwo algorithm is use to develop the optim pid control for the bipe robot
onc the pid control are optim the perform of the control in term of variou perform measur of the bipe robot are compar
final the gait gener use the optim pid control are test on a real bipe robot .
