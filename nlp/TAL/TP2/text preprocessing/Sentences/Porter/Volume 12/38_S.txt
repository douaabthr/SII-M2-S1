dm-limga dual migrat local island model genet algorithm a better divers preserv island model
island model genet algorithm imga is a multi-popul base ga
imga aim to avoid local optimum by maintain popul island divers use migrat
there are sever mechan of migrat and individu select such as the best or worst individu select new natur inspir evolut model and dynam migrat polici
migrat can delay island local converg and intrins preserv divers
iron migrat is also potenti to bring overal island global converg faster
in a certain gener the migrat individu among island will have similar valu genet drift
so thi work aim to preserv global divers better by implement local imga limga and dual dynam migrat polici ddmp
limga creat uniqu evolut trend by use a differ kind of ga for each island
ddmp is a new migrat polici which rule the individu migrat
ddmp determin the state of an island accord to it divers and attract level
by determin it state ddmp ensur the individu migrat to the correct island dynam
we call the combin of limga and ddmp as dual migrat limga dm-limga
our experi show that dm-limga can preserv the divers better
as it implic dm-limga can creat a more extens search space and domin the result among other solver .
