learn complex overlap and nich imbal boolean problem use xcs-base classifi system
xc is an accuracy-bas learn classifi system which ha been success appli to learn variou classif and function approxim problem
recent it ha been report that xc cannot learn overlap and nich imbal problem use the typic experiment setup
thi paper describ two approach to learn these complex problem firstli tune the paramet and adjust the method of standard xc specif for such problem
secondli appli an advanc variat of xc
specif we develop previous an xc with code-frag action name xcscfa which ha a more flexibl genet program like encod and explicit state-act map through comput action
thi approach is examin and compar with standard xc on six complex boolean dataset which includ overlap and nich imbal problem
the result indic that to learn overlap and nich imbal problem use xc it is benefici to either deactiv action set subsumpt or use a rel high subsumpt threshold and a small error threshold
the xcscfa approach success solv the test complex overlap and nich imbal problem without paramet tune becaus of the rich alphabet inconsist action and especi the redund provid by the code-frag action
the major contribut of the work present here is overcom the identifi problem in the wide-spread xc techniqu .
