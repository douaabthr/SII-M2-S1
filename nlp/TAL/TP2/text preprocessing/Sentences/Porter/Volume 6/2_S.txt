acceler iec and ec search with elit obtain by dimension reduct in regress space
we propos a method for acceler interact evolutionari comput iec and evolutionari comput ec search use elit obtain in one-dimension space and use benchmark function to evalu the propos method
the method project individu ontonone-dimension space correspond to each of thensearch paramet axe approxim each landscap use interpol or an approxim method find the best coordin from the approxim shape obtain the elit by combin the bestnfound coordin and use the elit for the next gener of the iec or ec
the advantag of thi method is that the elit may be easili obtain thank to their project onto each one-dimension space and there is a higher possibl that the elit individu locat near the global optimum
we compar the propos with method for obtain the landscap in the origin search space and show that our propos method can significantli save comput time
experiment evalu of the techniqu with differenti evolut use a simul iec user gaussian mixtur model with differ dimens and 34 benchmark function show that the propos method substanti acceler iec and ec search .
