knowledg extract and rule set compact in xc for non-markov multi-step problem
the applic of the xc famili of classifi system within multi-step problem ha shown promis but xc classifi system usual solv those problem with a larg number of classifi
if they can gener compact and readili interpret solut when use in multi-step problem it will enhanc their applic and use in a wide rang of robot control and knowledg discoveri task
in thi paper we describ some method develop for xc to compact the rule set and acquir explicit polici knowledg for multi-step problem especi non-markov problem
experiment result show the abil to obtain a veri compact rule set out of the final popul of classifi with littl or no degrad of overal perform .
