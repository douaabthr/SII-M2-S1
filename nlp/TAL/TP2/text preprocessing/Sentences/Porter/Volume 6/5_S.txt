self organ classifi first step in structur evolutionari machin learn
learn classifi system lcss are evolutionari machin learn algorithm flexibl enough to be appli to reinforc supervis and unsupervis learn problem with good perform
recent self organ classifi were propos which are similar to lcss but have the advantag that in it structur popul no balanc between nich and fit pressur is necessari
howev more test and analysi are requir to verifi it benefit
here a variat of the first algorithm is propos which use a parameterless self organ map som
thi algorithm is appli in challeng problem such as big noisi as well as dynam chang continu input-act maze grow and compress maze are includ with good perform
moreov a genet oper is propos which util the topolog inform of the som s popul structur improv the result
thu the first step in structur evolutionari machin learn are shown nonetheless the problem face are more difficult than the state-of-art continu input-act multi-step one .
