analysi of evolutionari process of fog comput system base on ba and er network hybrid model
fog comput is orient to the internet of thing which integr network comput storag and applic capabl
it is a semi-virtu distribut servic comput paradigm
it extend data data process and applic to the edg of the network and provid intellig servic for user nearbi
the purpos of thi paper is to design a safe stabl and effici fog comput model
on the basi of the structur of fog comput system the evolut process of fog comput node is model base on ba scale-fre network and er stochast network model
then the evolut process of network hybrid model is analyz
final the evolut model of fog comput system is solv and a network model with two network characterist is obtain
experi show that the hybrid network model ha the advantag of two basic network .
