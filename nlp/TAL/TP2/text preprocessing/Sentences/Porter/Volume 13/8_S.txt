a node-prior base large-scal overlap commun detect use evolutionari multi-object optim
commun structur is one of the most import featur in complex network
howev with increas of network scale some exist method cannot effect detect the commun structur of complex network and the avail method mostli aim at non-overlap network
in thi paper we focu on overlap commun detect in large-scal network becaus most of the commun in real-world network are overlap
in order to improv the accuraci of large-scal overlap commun detect we suggest a commun detect method base on node prioriti
the propos algorithm ha two advantag 1 we defin a prioriti function text f _ text nn to assess the close between adjac node
it explor the potenti commun structur in advanc and reduc the scale of network
2 we employ nsga-ii and select all pareto front to mine large-scal overlap commun
the propos algorithm is test by the artifici and real dataset
the result show that the propos algorithm can effect improv the accuraci of commun detect and ha better optim effect .
