motion plan for redund robot manipul use a novel multi-group particl swarm optim
metaheurist optim algorithm are wide use in motion plan of redund robot manipul
exist method may converg to a local minimum
in thi paper a new multi-group particl swarm optim algorithm psoel is propos to solv the motion plan of manipul
psoel consist of one elit group and sever child group
the popul is initi with a pre-select mechan in which the member of the elit group are initi with the best-perform particl of the child group
in the process of iter the elit group and the child group evolv separ
when the elit group fall into a local optimum or is inferior to child group for a certain time an interact mechan is trigger
in the interact mechan some of the best particl select from the child group will replac the bad particl of the elit group
with these mechan of pre-select and interact psoel can jump out of the local optimum and reach the global optimum or global suboptimum
simul result show that the propos algorithm psoel is superior to the compar algorithm and converg toward the optimum .
