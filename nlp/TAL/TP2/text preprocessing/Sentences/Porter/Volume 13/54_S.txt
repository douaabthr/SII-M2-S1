an intellig program genet algorithm with advanc determinist divers creat oper use object surfac visual
thi paper present a new fast intellig program genet algorithm ipga base evolutionari optim algorithm which requir lesser number of object function evalu for reach optima
the propos algorithm apart from use probabilist genet oper i. e
crossov and mutat also use a determinist divers creat oper for gener new solut in the current popul
thi is done by first project object surfac from higher dimens to lower dimens for visual purpos and then determinist gener new solut use some predefin rule in the region with higher object function valu
as the newli gener solut is in lower-dimension space these solut are again project back to higher dimension space and then the object function is evalu at that point
the propos ipga is test on three differ categori of standard test function viz
unimod function 2 test function unrot multimod function 6 test function and rotat multimod function 5 test function
simul result were compar with that obtain use binari code ga real code ga recent propos ga with differenti evolut crossov oper ga dex and anoth success-history-bas adapt ga with age mechan ga adexsp in term of mean and standard deviat of the object function averag number of object function evalu requir to reach optima and algorithm complex
simul result clearli demonstr better perform of the propos ipga when compar with other variant of ga .
