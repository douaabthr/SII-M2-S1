a neighborhood search base cat swarm optim algorithm for cluster problem
cluster is an unsupervis techniqu that group the similar data object into a singl subset use a distanc function
it is also use to find the optim set of cluster in a given dataset and each cluster consist of homogen data object
in present work an algorithm base on cat swarm optim cso is adopt for find the optim set of cluster center for alloc the data object
further some improv are also incorpor in cso algorithm for improv cluster perform
these modif are describ as an improv solut search equat to improv converg rate and an acceler veloc equat for balanc explor and exploit process of cso algorithm
moreov a neighborhood-bas search strategi is introduc to handl local optima problem
the perform of propos algorithm is test on eight real-lif dataset and compar with well-known cluster algorithm
the simul result show that propos algorithm provid qualiti result in comparison to exist cluster algorithm .
