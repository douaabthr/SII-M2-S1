a space transform crow search algorithm for optim problem
new and effici meta-heurist algorithm are alway in demand to solv real world optim problem due to it exploit capabl in the search domain to gener the global optim solut
crow search algorithm csa is one of the latest meta-heurist algorithm introduc in the literatur to solv optim task
the clever behaviour of crow attract the research to think how to achiev a better optim by use crow as a base element
like other optim algorithm the csa suffer with local optima and stagnat problem
in addit for complex real world problem csa ha not suffici explor capabl
therefor in the current work an attempt is made to enhanc the explor behaviour of the csa by combin the space transform search st method
the propos algorithm is name as sts-csa
the propos sts-csaintegr space transform search techniqu and comput the solut in current search space and transform search space simultan to gener solut that is closer to global optimum solut
to assess the perform in solv optim problem sts-csa ha been evalu by appli standard ieee cec 2017 benchmark function
three real-world engin problem are also verifi to assess the effect of the propos algorithm in solv the practic problem
the perform analysi such as statist measur converg analysi and complex measur reveal that the propos method is reliabl and effici in solv practic optim problem .
