metaheurist anophel search algorithm
today variou optim problem have been solv use differ optim techniqu such as linear program nonlinear program and dynam program
these method mainli tri to find optim solut in the proxim of start point
due to increas in complex of optim problem and number of optim point effici of these method in find global optima ha decreas
the mention challeng encourag research to introduc novel method inspir by natur phenomena
in thi studi anophel metaheurist search algorithm which is inspir by transmiss of malaria diseas by anophel mosquito is propos
our propos method might be util in engin optim problem with continu design variabl
the algorithm explor search space use random search in order to elimin unnecessari inform
the effici of anophel optim algorithm is evalu use famou optim problem
also the perform of the propos method is compar with other optim method .
