an enhanc moth-flam optim algorithm for permutation-bas problem
moth-flam optim mfo is one of the recent propos metaheurist optim techniqu which ha been success use in wide rang of applic
howev there are two issu with the mfo algorithm
first as a stochast techniqu mfo may prematur converg at some local minima dure the search process
second the origin mfo wa develop for continu search space problem and is not directli applic to e.g. permutation-bas problem pbp
in thi paper a novel perturb strategi is introduc to the mfo algorithm to avoid probabl local minima region
thi strategi work as follow if the best solut obtain so far doesn t improv for a given number of consecut iter the current popul of solut is perturb use some crossov mechan as an attempt to explor new promis neighbourhood in the search space
in addit smallest posit valu map techniqu is employ in order for the propos term crossmfo comfo algorithm to be applic to pbp problem
it is notic that despit these modif the propos comfo ha the same time complex order as the origin mfo
extens simul experi are conduct to compar the propos comfo to the mfo other enhanc version of mfo and some metaheurist optim in solv the well-known travel salesman problem tsp
empir result show that the solut obtain use mfo are improv by a factor of 24 47% on averag for larg tsp instanc have more than 100 citi use comfo and can even reach 38 58% use differ set
in addit compar to other algorithm in the literatur the propos algorithm provid on averag better solut
henc it can be consid a promis and effici techniqu for thi type of problem .
