a hybrid evsa approach in cluster search space with ad-hoc partit for multi-robot search
thi paper examin the problem of multi-robot target search in an unknown environ
sinc no inform is avail about the target so the search is similar to the explor problem
in thi paper a new method is propos to improv the effici of explor
the object of the propos approach is to minim the explor time by reduc the redund coverag and comput overhead
for explor the concept of frontier is be use
the follow hypothesi formul in order to improv the explor 1 introduct of an ad-hoc partit method to handl redund coverag
2 reduct of the search space by cluster group the frontier cell to minim the comput overhead
3 introduct of method for robot next posit assign problem name nearest frontier-clust center method when a singl robot is search in the sub-region
a hybrid of egyptian vultur and simul anneal base approach when more than one robot are search within a sub-region
perform of the propos approach is evalu through simul in two differ workspac with a team size of 2 and 4 robot
four differ perform measur name redund coverag object local time explor time and explor percentag are consid to evalu the perform of the propos method
result show that propos hybrid-evsa method complet explor much faster in both the workspac with the team size of 2 and 4 robot as compar to other state of art approach due to low comput overhead and reduc redund coverag .
