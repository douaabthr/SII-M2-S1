a novel hybrid bat algorithm with a fast clustering-bas hybrid
bat algorithm ba is a new and promis metaheurist search algorithm which could outperform exist algorithm
howev ba can be easili trap in a local optimum regard to low explor abil
the present studi propos a new local-search-bas hybrid heurist to escap such scenario
the propos hybrid ba hba use a clustering-bas hybrid method which detect the earli converg of ba popul by analyz similar among individu
the main motiv for such an analysi is that when ba is continu converg the similar among individu becom higher
the propos hba is extens evalu on cec2017 benchmark suit
the experi demonstr that the algorithm achiev better result than continu variant of ba in everi way
moreov as a case studi a binari version of the propos hba hbba is appli to the well-known featur select problem
the record result on 13 dataset demonstr that hbba would be consid as a new state-of-art in metaheuristic-bas wrapper featur select method .
