we appli thi method to solv thestein tree problem stp a well-known np-hard problem have applic to area like telecommun rout or vlsi design among mani other
we show that the gradient orient of rfd make it especi suitabl for solv thi problem and we report the result of sever experi where rfd as well as an implement ofant coloni optim aco dorigo in ant coloni optim
mit press new york 2004 are appli to some benchmark graph from the steinlib testdata librari koch in steinlib testdata librari
technic report konrad-zuse-zentrum für informationstechnik berlin 2009
we also studi the capabl of rfd and aco to deal with a scenario where the graph is modifiedaftera solut is found and next a solut for the new graph ha to be found either by run the algorithm from scratch or by adapt the structur previous form by the algorithm to construct their previou solut .
