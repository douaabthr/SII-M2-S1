artifici immun optim system solv constrain omni-optim
thi work investig an artifici immun optim system suitabl for singl and multi-object constrain optim
in thi optim an evalu index which can decid the import of individu in the current popul is develop to acceler popul divis the niching-lik prolifer scheme is introduc to strengthen the divers of popul
thereaft those divers antibodi with the help of immun evolut oper evolv their structur along differ direct
theoret result show that such optim system is converg with low comput complex
experiment one such optim is suffici examin by a suit of singl and multi-object test problem
compar experi illustr that the optim with some strike characterist is a potenti altern optim tool for constrain omni-optim .
