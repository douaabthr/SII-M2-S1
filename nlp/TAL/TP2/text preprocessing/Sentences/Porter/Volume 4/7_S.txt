collect classif of textual document by guid self-organ in t-cell cross-regul dynam
we present and studi an agent-bas model of t-cell cross-regul in the adapt immun system which we appli to binari classif
our method expand an exist analyt model of t-cell cross-regul carneiro et al
in immunol rev 216 1 48 68,2007 that wa use to studi the self-organ dynam of a singl popul of t-cell in interact with an ideal antigen present cell capabl of present a singl antigen
with agent-bas model we are abl to studi the self-organ dynam of multipl popul of distinct t-cell which interact via antigen present cell that present hundr of distinct antigen
moreov we show that such self-organ dynam can be guid to produc an effect binari classif of antigen which is competit with exist machin learn method when appli to biomed text classif
more specif here we test our model on a dataset of publicli avail full-text biomed articl provid by the biocr challeng kralling in the biocr ii
5 challeng overview p 19,2009
we studi the robust of our model s paramet configur and show that it lead to encourag result compar to state-of-the-art classifi
our result help us understand both t-cell cross-regul as a gener principl of guid self-organ as well as it applic to document classif
therefor we show that our bio-inspir algorithm is a promis novel method for biomed articl classif and for binari document classif in gener .
