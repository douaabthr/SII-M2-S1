an evolutionari cognit architectur made of a bag of network
a cognit architectur is present for model some properti of sensorimotor learn in infant name the abil to accumul adapt and skill over multipl task in a manner which allow recombin and re-us of task specif compet
the control architectur invent consist of a popul of compart unit of neuroevolut each contain network capabl of control a robot with mani degre of freedom
the node of the network undergo intern mutat and the network undergo stochast structur modif constrain by a mutat and recombin grammar
the node use consist of dynam system such as dynam movement primit continu time recurr neural network and high-level supervis and unsupervis learn algorithm
edg in the network repres the pass of inform from a send node to a receiv node
the network in a compart oper in parallel and encod a space of possibl subsumption-lik architectur that are use to success evolv a varieti of behaviour for a nao h25 humanoid robot .
