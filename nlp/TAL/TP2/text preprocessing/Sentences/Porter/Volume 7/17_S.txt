improv of the perform of the quantum-inspir evolutionari algorithm structur popul oper
popul divers is veri import in give the algorithm the power to explor the search space and not get trap in local optima
in thi respect use a probabilist represent for the quantum individu the quantum-inspir evolutionari algorithm qiea claim higher divers in the popul
here consid thi import featur of qiea we propos differ structur to offer better interact between the q-individu and propos new oper to preserv the divers in the popul and thu improv the perform of the qiea
the effect of the structur popul is investig on the perform of the algorithm
addit two oper are propos in thi paper
be call the divers preserv qiea the first oper find the converg similar q-individu around a local optimum and while keep the best q-individu by reiniti the inferior one push them out of the basin of attract of the local optimum so help the algorithm to search other region in the search space
the other oper is a reiniti oper which by reiniti the whole popul help it escap from the local optima it is trap in
by studi the effect of the paramet of the propos oper on their perform we show how the propos oper improv the perform of qiea
experi are perform on knapsack trap and fourteen numer object function and the result show better perform for the propos algorithm than the origin version of qiea .
