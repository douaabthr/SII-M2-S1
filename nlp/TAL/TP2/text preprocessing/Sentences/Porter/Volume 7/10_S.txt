simultan versu increment learn of multipl skill by modular robot
thi paper is concern with the problem of learn multipl skill by modular robot
the main question we address is whether it is better to learn multipl skill simultan all-at-onc or increment one-by-on
we conduct an experiment studi with modular robot of variou morpholog that need to acquir three differ but correl skill effici locomot navig toward a target point and obstacl avoid use a real-tim on-board evolut as the learn method
the result indic that the one-by-on strategi is more effici and more stabl than the all-at-onc strategi .
