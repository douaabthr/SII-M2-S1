cooper coevolutionari algorithm for dynam optim an experiment studi
in thi paper we studi the cooper coevolutionari algorithm ccea for dynam optim
we introduc the ccea with two popular type of individu 1 random immigr ri that increas the divers for chang environ and 2 elitist individu that increas the local converg to the optima
the ccea are evalu on a standard suit of benchmark problem and are compar with evolut strategi es
our experiment result show that the ccea are effici in locat and track optima in dynam environ
they are superior to the es when the ri individu and the elitist individu are use
in addit we empir investig how the ccea perform with differ paramet set
these set includ collabor method the use of plu comma select and the number of ri individu and elitist individu
we also investig the ccea that use a mutativeσ-self adapt
the ccea perform the best when they use the best collabor method and the plu select
the use of the mutativeσ-self adapt is insignific
our result also show that the ccea are more scalabl than the es in dynam environ .
