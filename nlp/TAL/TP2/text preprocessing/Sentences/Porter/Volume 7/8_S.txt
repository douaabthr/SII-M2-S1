the distribut co-evolut of an on-board simul and control for swarm robot behaviour
we investig the realiti gap specif the environment correspond of an on-board simul
we describ a novel distribut co-evolutionari approach to improv the transfer of control that co-evolv with an on-board simul
a novelti of our approach is the the potenti to improv transfer between simul and realiti without an explicit measur between the two domain
we hypothesis that a variat of on-board simul environ model across mani robot can be competit exploit by comparison of the real control fit of mani robot
we hypothesis that the real control fit valu across mani robot can be taken as indic of the vari fit in environment correspond of on-board simul and use to inform the distribut evolut an on-board simul environ model without explicit measur of the real environ
our result demonstr that our approach creat an adapt relationship between the on-board simul environ model the real world behaviour of the robot and the state of the real environ
the result indic that our approach is sensit to whether the real behaviour perform of the robot is inform on the state real environ .
