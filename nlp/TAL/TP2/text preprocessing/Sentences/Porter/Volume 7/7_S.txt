beyond black-box optim a review of select pressur for evolutionari robot
evolutionari robot er is often view as the applic of a famili of black-box optim algorithm evolutionari algorithm to the design of robot or part of robot
when consid er as black-box optim the select pressur is mainli driven by a user-defin black-box fit function and a domain-independ select procedur
howev most er experi face similar challeng in similar setup the select pressur and in particular the fit function is not a pure user-defin black box
the present review show that becaus er experi share common featur select pressur for er are a subject of research on their own
the literatur ha been split into two categori goal refin aim at chang the definit of a good solut and process helper design to help the search process
two sub-categori are further consid task-specif approach which requir knowledg on how to solv the task and task-agnost one which do not need it
besid highlight the divers of the approach and their respect goal the present review show that mani task-agnost process helper have been propos dure the last year thu bring us closer to the goal of a fulli autom robot behavior design process .
