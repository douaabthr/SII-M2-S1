classif model for meticul presag of heart diseas through nca use machin learn
for the design and implement of clinic decis support system comput time and prognost accuraci are veri import
to analyz the larg collect of a dataset for detect and diagnosi diseas machin learn techniqu are use
accord to the report of world health organ heart diseas is a major caus of death and killer in urban and rural area or worldwid
the main reason for thi is a shortag of doctor and delay in the diagnosi
the outcom presag of thi diseas is a veri challeng job
thi propos work use the approach of self-diagnosi algorithm fuzzi artifici neural network and nca and pca and imput method
by the use of thi techniqu reduc the comput time for predict of coronari heart diseas
for the implement of thi the two dataset are use such as cleveland and statlog dataset
in thi research work heart diseas is a diagnosi by use the clinic paramet of patient for earli stage
classifi use for that random forest algorithm ann and k-nn algorithm
the dataset for the diseas predict measur are use to accur calcul the differ between variabl and to determin whether they are correl or not
for thi classif model the perform measur is calcul in requisit of their accuraci precis recal and specif
thi approach is evalu on the heart diseas dataset for improv the accuraci perform result obtain
the experiment result obtain by nca provid greater perform in term of perform metric for the multipl classifi like rf dt nb svm
the aim of thi studi to develop the classif model as well as show a compar analysi between exist system is discuss
in thi paper for cleveland dataset ha taken 303 instanc and 14 attribut are use
thi dataset ha preprocess dataset
thi paper depict the higher accuraci score with the multipl classifi such as random forest svm and nb use nca is 99.34 and for dt is 98
overal nca is best in term of classif accuraci
the result show not onli accuraci for the propos method but obtain better result for multipl classifi that exhibit their reliabl . in medic scienc thi approach is use to predict heart diseas at it earli stage . the outcom for knn sda nca fuzzi ann for cleveland dataset accuraci achiev 98.56% and for statlog dataset 98.66%
thi result describ the hybrid method use for predict of heart diseas and achiev better result .
