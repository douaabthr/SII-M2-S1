diagnosi of covid-19 use chest x-ray imag base on modifi darkcovidnet model
coronaviru diseas also known as covid-19 is an infecti diseas caus by sars-cov-2
it ha a direct impact on the upper and lower respiratori tract and threaten the health of mani peopl around the world
the latest statist show that the number of peopl diagnos with covid-19 is grow exponenti
diagnos posit case of covid-19 is import for prevent further spread of the diseas
current coronaviru is a seriou threat to scientist medic expert and research around the world from it detect to it treatment
it is current detect use revers transcript polymeras chain reaction rt-pcr analysi at the most test center around the world
yet know the reliabl of a deep learn base medic diagnosi is import for doctor to build confid in the technolog and improv treatment
the goal of thi studi is to develop a model that automat identifi covid-19 by use chest x-ray imag
to achiev thi we modifi the darkcovidnet model which is base on a convolut neural network cnn and plot the experiment result for two scenario binari classif covid-19 versu no-find and multi-class classif covid-19 versu pneumonia versu no-find
the model is train on more than 10 thousand x-ray imag and achiev an averag accuraci of 99.53% and 94.18% for binari and multi-class classif respect
therefor the propos method demonstr the effect of covid-19 detect use x-ray imag
our model can be use to test the patient via cloud and also be use in situat where rt-pcr test and other option aren t avail .
