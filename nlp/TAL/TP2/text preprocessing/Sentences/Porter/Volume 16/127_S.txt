scenario-bas passeng evacu optim with multipl travel mode in transit termin
the transit termin is dens popul place with limit road and park capac
the contradict between suppli and demand will reduc the evacu effici of passeng arriv the transit termin
thi paper consid the evacu capac of multipl travel mode on the arriv passeng at the transit termin at the same time regard multipl travel mode as a whole and coordin the transport capac of variou mode
a bi-object model is propos
the first object is minim the evacu cost while the second object is minim the number of passeng transfer
the propos bi-object model is transform into a single-object one by linear weight method
the transform model is essenti a mixed-integ linear program which is solv by lingo
to valid the valid of the propos model a case studi of beij west railway station is present
the result indic thi propos methodolog is ration and effect and can help passeng evacu in practic applic .
