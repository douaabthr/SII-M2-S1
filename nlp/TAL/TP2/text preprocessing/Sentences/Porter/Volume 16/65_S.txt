min max kurtosi mean distanc base k-mean initi centroid initi method for big genom data cluster
genom cluster is a big data applic that use the k-mean km cluster approach to discov hidden pattern and trend in gene for diseas diagnosi biolog analysi and tissu detect
the km algorithm is highli depend on the initi centroid becaus it determin the effect effici comput resourc and local optima of the km cluster
the exist initi centroid initi approach trap local optima due to random and achiev high comput cost due to the enorm interrel dimens
therefor the km algorithm produc the lowest qualiti cluster and maxim the comput time and resourc consumpt
to address thi issu thi studi ha present the min max kurtosi mean distanc mkmd algorithm for big data cluster in a singl machin environ
the mkmd algorithm enhanc the effect and effici of the km algorithm by measur the distanc between data point of the minimum maximum kurtosi dimens and their mean
the perform of the present algorithm ha been compar against km km adv mkm mean-km nfd k-mam nrkm2 fmnn and mukm algorithm use intern and extern effect evalu criteria with effici assess on sixteen genom dataset
the experiment result reveal that the mkmdkm algorithm minim iter distanc comput data comparison local optima resourc consumpt and improv cluster perform effect and effici with stabl converg and result as compar to other algorithm
accord to the statist analysi the propos mkmdkm algorithm ha achiev statist signific by employ the friedman test and the post hoc test .
