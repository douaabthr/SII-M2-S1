evolutionari algorithm applic for iot dedic to precis irrig system state of the art
the world is current undergo water scarciti problem even if it seem to be the most abund resourc on earth
howev the freshwat account is realli in small amount while agricultur product consum 70% of the major of water withdraw than ani other sourc
therefor in order to preserv it the irrig oper ha to be optim by control effici the water use for irrig
for that purpos sever technolog can be appli such as the internet of thing iot technolog which can perform as decis support in the irrig process
the precis irrig system base on iot involv sever intricaci such as huge amount of data and integr of larg system compon which make it difficult to be optim analyt or with determinist method
for thi reason it wa necessari to develop stochast multi-object optim method such as the evolutionari algorithm ea which can solv complic problem with a larg number of paramet in relat
the ea may be of relev use except that they introduc process time constraint
in thi articl we aim at make a state of the art about the use of ea combin with iot and appli to precis irrig
we will focu particularli on their use classif as well as the manner in which they have been implement to reduc their comput time in distribut comput architectur particularli those use the cloud as well as in hardwar acceler form .
