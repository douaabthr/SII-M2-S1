reference-lin steer guid assign and updat for pareto-bas many-object particl swarm optim
the reference-lines-framework ha been success use for develop effici many-object evolutionari algorithm
in thi paper the concept and methodolog of such evolutionari algorithm are adapt in the parlanc of multi-object particl swarm optim mopso for address the challeng of assign and updat the global and local guid
the propos algorithm which is refer to as rmaopso is develop via five modul use the framework so that a divers set of guid can be select to steer the search of mopso toward the pareto-optim front
the modul includ global guid assign local and global guid updat line assign to the guid and swarm and evolutionari search for global guid
the propos algorithm is test on dtlz and wfg test instanc of 3 5 8 10 and 15 object
result obtain from rmaopso show it efficaci over six multi-object evolutionari and mopso algorithm from the literatur .
