a self-learn particl swarm optim algorithm with multi-strategi select
particl swarm optim ha been wide util to tackl variou real optim problem as an effect and simpl optim approach
howev the phenomenon of prematur converg ha alway exist
to amelior the drawback a self-learn particl swarm optim algorithm with multi-strategi select mslspso is propos in thi studi
in mslspso an elit particl guidanc strategi is propos
thi strategi make elit particl particip in the search process to strengthen the guidanc of the popul
a lévi flight perturb strategi is design which util the random walk characterist of lévi flight to perturb the histor and global optim of particl increas the divers of the popul
in addit a fit distanc correl self-learn mechan is propos which can self-learn accord to the characterist of the popul in the search process
a set of test function are util for experiment analysi and compar with four well-known pso variant
experiment result show that the mslspso algorithm ha effici robust and competit solut can be obtain .
