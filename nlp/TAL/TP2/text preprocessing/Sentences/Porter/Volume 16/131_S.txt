new direct for secur attack privaci and malwar detect in wban
wireless bodi area network wban is an excel platform to transfer crucial health data from a human bodi to the databas over a public channel
thu it is essenti to protect sensit data as an adversari can intercept commun
besid it is also vital to verifi the user sender and receiv befor provid data access for health inform
to deal with these challeng differ messag transmiss protocol are design to check the user legitimaci data correct and secreci of inform
the big data-driven futurist fabric system b ff databas contain a lot of user data
b ff is group into three categori data collect data gather and error check
by collect use user data from multipl sourc a smart b ff enhanc the busi decis support process
the data come from a varieti of way includ sensor that collect traffic health weather and transfer data as well as updat to variou social network site
research in thi work have suggest differ data transmiss scheme for wban to enhanc secur while exchang messag
they have discuss variou featur limit and construct of exist wban data transmiss mechan to clearli understand the strength and weak of the exist work
to make it more clearli to reader research in thi studi have describ differ essenti secur properti for wban commun
in addit research have explain variou secur attack which can be launch dure messag transmiss in wban
moreov possibl countermeasur are discuss to resist the discuss attack
final while deal with the wban system thi survey studi present a comprehens discuss of the secur properti attack and countermeasur
final thi work aid research in develop wban data transfer techniqu .
