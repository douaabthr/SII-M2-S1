bat competit swarm optim enabl dmn for automat recommend of learn object
the e-learn recommend system in the learn academi is progress grow with respect to the prefer deliveri mode as it deleg learn anywher anytim
in gener e-learn system fail to satisfi the need of the individu learner with respect to their profil
thi research focus on design an automat recommend approach for the learner use the propos optim algorithm name bat competit swarm optim bcso
initi the e-learn content are ad into one learn repositori where the learn object are upload manual as well as dynam
the web crawler is use for the automat content prepar by input the parent link with the restrict rule list
thereaft the categor of the e-learn object is done on the basi of type topic and prepar method use interv type-2 fuzzi local enhanc base rough k-mean cluster automat
onc the e-learn topic are categor the automat recommend of learn object to the user is carri out by deep maxout network dmn
here the train of dmn is perform base on bcso which is devis by the combin of bat algorithm with competit swarm optim
furthermor the perform of the develop approach is analyz and compar with the exist method
the analysi depict that the propos method ha the precis of 0.941 recal of 0.941 and f-measur of 0.938 .
