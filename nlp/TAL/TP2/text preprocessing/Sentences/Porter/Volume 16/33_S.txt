an improv monarch butterfli optim base multivari fuzzi time seri approach for forecast gdp of india
gross domest product gdp is a crucial indic to evalu nation econom develop of a nation and the statu of the macro-economi of a countri
in the present work we have propos a novel approach for predict india s nomin gdp
six new variabl have been consid to predict the gdp of india for which a hybridis model compris of the multivari fuzzi time seri mvft model and the monarch butterfli optim mbo algorithm is use
mbo is use to determin the optim length of interv in the univers of discours uod while keep the number of interv constant
the accuraci of the result algorithm is determin by take the measur mean absolut percentag error mape and root mean squar error rmse
the outcom obtain show that the propos mvfts-mbo algorithm outperform the exist method for the predict of india s gdp .
