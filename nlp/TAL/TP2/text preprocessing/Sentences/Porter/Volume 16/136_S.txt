mobil robot monocular vision-bas obstacl avoid algorithm use a deep neural network
in recent decad obstacl avoid ha been one of the main challeng in autonom vehicl navig which ha been use in a wide rang of differ autonom devic and it is also a fundament requir for mobil robot
in thi paper a novel method is propos and evalu for mobil robot navig in an unknown environ while avoid collis with unexpect obstacl
thi mobil robot ha been equip with a mono-vis sensor which commun with the environ
therefor the decision-mak unit is entir vision-bas and no other sensor is use to commun with the environ
the deep neural network method ha been use to inform the robot about the suitabl direct of movement but central decision-mak unit will do some preprocess on the output command befor send it to the oper unit
in thi research variou techniqu are investig to train the convolut neural network in a better way to gener more accur command for the mobil robot s movement toward the safe area without collid into ani obstacl
besid lot of variou method have been use to increas the perform of the neural network
the most import one is use an adjust learn rate
the result show the vital role of learn rate in network perform
the design network attain a 96.88% accuraci and a 0.14 loss which indic that thi approach could success improv the neural network perform and reason solv the obstacl avoid problem .
