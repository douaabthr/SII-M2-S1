multi-object evolutionari algorithm for vehicl rout problem with time window under uncertainti
vehicl rout problem vrp are to arrang the optim rout under the variou requir and it is becom signific in the logist industri as electr commerc is rise
howev uncertainti is inevit in vrp
in thi manuscript we consid the vrp with time window vrptw under uncertainti
we formul the robust multi-object vrptw rmovrptw model and propos a robust optim algorithm base on moea/d r-moead-vrp for simultan optim the total distanc and the number of vehicl requir for transport
first we use the prioriti of the custom be serv to encod and use the defin transform approach to form the feasibl rout
next we employ order crossov and exchang mutat oper to increas popul divers
for the new rout by reproduct we use monte-carlo test to check the feasibl of the rout after ad uncertainti
for the feasibl rout we calcul the solut robust valu base on the defin method
final we consid both optim and robust to form a set of highli robust and rel optim solut
for verifi the avail of the present algorithm the simul experi conduct on solomon s benchmark problem compar with sever relat algorithm
experiment result show that our propos algorithm can bring more robust and non-domin solut under uncertainti and can achiev good perform .
