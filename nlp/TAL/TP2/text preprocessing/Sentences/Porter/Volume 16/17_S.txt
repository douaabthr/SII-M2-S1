nature-inspir optimum-path forest
the optimum-path forest opf is a graph-bas classifi that model pattern recognit problem as a graph partit task
the opf learn process is perform in a competit fashion where a few key sampl i.e. prototyp tri to conquer the remain train sampl to build optimum-path tree opt
the task of select prototyp is paramount to obtain high-qual opt thu be of great import to the classifi
the most use approach comput a minimum span tree over the train set and promot the sampl nearbi the decis boundari as prototyp
although such methodolog ha obtain promis result in the past year it can be prone to overfit
in thi work it is propos a metaheuristic-bas approach opfmh for the select of prototyp be such a task model as an optim problem whose goal is to improv accuraci
the experiment result show the opfmhcan reduc overfit as well as the number of prototyp in mani situat
moreov opfmhachiev competit accuraci and outperform opf in the experiment scenario .
