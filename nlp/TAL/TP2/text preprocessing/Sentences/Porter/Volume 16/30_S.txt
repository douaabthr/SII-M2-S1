an island-bas hybrid evolutionari algorithm for caloric-restrict diet
the most popular and success way to maintain a healthi bodi is to have a rich and balanc diet combin with physic exercis
sinc the diet dilemma wa propos sever work in the literatur suggest calcul a diet that respect the nutrit need of each person
in the caloric-restrict diet problem crdp the goal is to find a reduced-calori diet that meet these nutrit need enabl weight loss
thi paper propos an island-bas hybrid evolutionari algorithm ibhea that use a genet algorithm ga and a differenti evolut de algorithm with differ paramet set in differ island commun through sever migrat polici to solv the crdp
comput experi show that ibhea outperform more than 5% compar with non-distribut and non-hybrid implement gener a greater varieti of diet with a small calori count .
