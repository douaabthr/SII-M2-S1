optim coverage-awar trajectori plan forauvsfor effici data collect in underwat acoust sensor network
in the autonom underwat vehicl auv base underwat acoust sensor network uasn effici data collect with minimum delay and high throughput is a fundament research challeng
most of the exist data collect scheme usingauvsar suffer from unbalanc energi consumpt long delay partial coverag and incomplet data collect problem
to overcom these problem thi paper propos an optim coverage-awar target node select and trajectori plan scheme forauvsfor fast and effici data collect in the underwat sensor network
optim select of coverage-awar target node and trajectori plan of the multipleauvsar propos use backtrack search optim bso techniqu
after deploy of the underwat sensor node first network is partit into a set of load balanc cluster-region
after that optim coverage-awar target node is select from each cluster-region for collect of the sens data usingauv
for optim the trajectori of theauv abso-bas trajectori plan scheme is propos with novel fit function
the propos scheme dispatch multipleauvsconcurr for high avail and low delay in the data collect from the cluster-region
perform of the propos scheme is evalu and compar with some latest state-of-art exist scheme in term of coverag ratio total travel distanc maximum travel distanc delay and averag energi consumpt
simul result confirm that the propos scheme perform well and veri capabl in provid the fast and high avail of the sens data collect fromuasn .
