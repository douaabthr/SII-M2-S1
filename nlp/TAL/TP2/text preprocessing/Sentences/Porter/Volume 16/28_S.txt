a hybrid metaheurist method for solv resourc constrain project schedul problem
resourc constrain project schedul problem rcpsp is a renown variant of the schedul problem
rcpsp is veri import in product and manag but comput hard
it is wide use in mani field like job shop schedul flow shop schedul transact plan wireless commun etc
the object of solv rcpsp is to obtain minimum makespan maintain all constraint
there are some exact approxim heurist and metaheurist algorithm which were propos to solv thi problem
rcpsp is an np-hard problem
chemic reaction optim cro is a popul base metaheurist method to solv such problem and it show better perform compar with some other exist algorithm
cro explor the larg search space both local and global use it four oper
genet algorithm ga is also a natur inspir algorithm which is use to solv variou optim problem
in thi paper we are propos a hybrid metaheurist approach that integr chemic reaction optim cro and genet algorithm ga name cro-ga to solv rcpsp
we have redesign the basic oper of cro and ga to find out the solut
an addit oper call prioriti base select oper is use in cro to adjust with ga
our propos method is compar with other relat approach such as adapt particl swarm optim a-pso multi agent optim algorithm maoa artifici bee coloni abc genet algorithm ga which are state of the art for the rcpsp
the experiment result show that our propos methodolog give better result than other exist algorithm to solv rcpsp with less comput time .
