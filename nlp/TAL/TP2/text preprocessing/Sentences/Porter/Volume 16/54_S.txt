evolutionari approach for the weight anti-cov locat problem
given a set of potenti facil locat site along with a posit weight associ with each site as per it import the anti-cov locat problem aclp is about locat a set of facil at some of these potenti locat such that no two facil are closer than a given distanc from each other and sum of weight of chosen locat is as larg as possibl
thi mathcal np hard problem ha sever import real-world applic such as telecommun equip site locat militari unit locat franchis outlet locat obnoxi facil forest manag and dna sequenc match
there are weight and unweight version of aclp
the unweight version of aclp is wide studi in the literatur
howev the weight version did not receiv much attent despit sever real-world applic
in thi paper we have propos two evolutionari approach base on genet algorithm ga and discret differenti evolut dde to solv the weight version of the aclp
the propos approach are use to solv the 80 aclp instanc with upto 1577 potenti site
comput result show the effect of our approach .
