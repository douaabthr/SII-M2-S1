heart failur recognit use human voic analysi and artifici intellig
heart failur hf is a clinic syndrom that disabl the heart from pump blood to effect nourish the bodi or doe it to elev intracardiac pressur
current the main diagnost method for thi patholog are perform clinic by the measur of biomark such as b-type natriuret peptid bnp and by cardiac imag method
as cardiovascular diseas are the primari caus of prematur death new technolog to identifi these diseas at an earli stage are of great import
thu thi research present the develop of two artifici neural network ann one for each gender that recogn the vocal distort caus by hf in an individu
therefor the voic of 142 individu were collect separ by sex and age
among these 142 84 voic of peopl alreadi diagnos with hf were collect at the heart institut of sao paulo univers incor usp and the metropolitan hospit of paraiba
also the voic of 58 healthi individu were collect in an extra-hospit environ
then the follow techniqu were appli to extract the signal featur statist analysi fft discret wavelet transform and mel-cepstr analysi
the select featur were use to develop ann that aim to identifi hf
both ann achiev an effici of 96.7%
also valu of 91.86% 88.1% and 92.1% were obtain for accuraci sensit and specif respect
therefor compar the result reach by thi research to other studi in the field it is possibl to conclud that the use of voic analysi repres a great improv in hf recognit and earli treatment .
