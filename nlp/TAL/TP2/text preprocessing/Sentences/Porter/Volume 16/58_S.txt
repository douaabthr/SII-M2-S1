perform comparison of inertia weight and acceler coeffici of bpso in the context of high-util itemset mine
one of the best perform method in high-util itemset mine is base on binari particl swarm optim
thi paper aim to improv the qualiti of that method by find way to increas both the number of obtain itemset and the associ total util of those itemset
the method use is base on binari particl swarm optim which is one of the best algorithm to obtain high-util itemset base on swarm intellig
to get the maximum result we tune up the method to determin the optim configur of four paramet initi popul inertia weight acceler coeffici and veloc clamp
our experiment result on five dataset indic that the best configur is combin constrict factor or adapt method for set inertia weight and use self-adapt for acceler coeffici
the use of frequent itemset or transact of the highest total util for initi popul doe not have a signific addit compar to the inertia weight and acceler coeffici paramet
the correct configur of the binari particl swarm optim can increas the number of high-util itemset compar to the standard configur
the percentag increas of the number of itemset compar to the exist standard method is 157.93% for chess dataset 134.39% for connect dataset 42.69% for accid dataset 4.62% for foodmart dataset and 1.58% for mushroom dataset .
