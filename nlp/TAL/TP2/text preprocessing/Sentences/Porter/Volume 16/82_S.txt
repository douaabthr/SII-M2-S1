damag identif in structur element by grasshopp optim algorithm use dynam structur behavior
time inspect of structur is necessari to prevent damag progress and ensur the safeti and effici of structur at the lowest cost
the exist of defect and partial failur in structur is the sourc of gener failur and threat to the behavior of structur
in mani case impend failur may not be appar from it appear
henc the studi of structur failur is one of the essenti area of research that help increas the structur s life and control the failur of structur
thi research aim to investig an approach for detect damag in the structur especi in the plate
an effici method util the grasshopp optim algorithm goa as an optim solver is present here to detect the multiple-damag of structur system
acceler chang of a structur are consid as a criterion for damag occurr
the structur damag detect problem is first transmut into a standard optim problem deal with continu variabl
then the goa is util to solv the optim problem for find the site and sever of structur damag
to assess the perform of the propos method for damag identif numer exampl with consid measur nois are consid
all the result demonstr the effect of the propos method for accur determin the site and sever of multiple-damag
also the perform of the goa for damag detect compar to the differenti evolut algorithm dea is confirm by a numer exampl .
