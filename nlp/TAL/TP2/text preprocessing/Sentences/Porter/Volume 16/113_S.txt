smart advertis design a visual aesthet effect improv base on imag data analysi
smart advertis is an import part of the modern inform industri
the main problem of smart advertis in chines citi at thi stage includ clutter set singl form lack of coordin and integr between advertis and citi and urban build and inconspicu visual effect
in order to deal with these problem it is necessari to optim the design of smart advertis to enhanc the visual aesthet effect
imag aesthet qualiti assess ha good applic prospect in industri such as imag recommend and imag edit aesthet and can be use to help smart advertis improv visual aesthet
thi paper propos an object quantit score method for imag aesthet base on a multi-scal featur extract network which is a comput intellig approach
the model is mainli compos of multipl multi-scal featur extract unit cascad and each unit contain a featur extract layer compos of 3 differ convolut kernel fusion layer and map layer
the featur extract layer form the input end of the network by combin the global view and local view of the imag
at the output end the emd function is use as the loss function and the output distribut is a probabl densiti mass function of 1 10 point
in order to verifi the effect of the method in thi paper the ava dataset which is commonli use in the field of imag aesthet evalu is select for test experi
in thi paper two paramet spearman rank correl coeffici and accuraci rate are select as indic to evalu the method in thi paper
the experiment result show that the method propos in thi paper is feasibl and effect
outperform sever mainstream model on the ava dataset .
