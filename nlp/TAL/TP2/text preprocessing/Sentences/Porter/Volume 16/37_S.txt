fast partial imag encrypt with fuzzi logic and chaotic map
the propos techniqu offer an autom imag encrypt as an altern to the manual select encrypt of color imag
fuzzi rule base on color detail are appli to select the area to encrypt
it can be use for secur commun of sensit part of the imag without disturb the remain part of the imag
strength of thi algorithm is it speed immun to differenti attack and entropi
it is six time faster as compar to the normal encrypt
thi algorithm is more suitabl for satellit imag and medic imag
it find an applic in the area of inform secur and data forens where imag are larger in size .
