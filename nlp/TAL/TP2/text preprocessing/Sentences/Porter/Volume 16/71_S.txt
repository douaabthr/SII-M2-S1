adult content imag recognit by boltzmann machin limit and deep learn
adult content imag have a detriment effect on internet user a signific number of whom are minor
therefor it is essenti to control and detect adult content imag use multimedia process and comput vision techniqu
previou studi have typic focus on manual-engin visual featur that may be difficult to detect and analyz
thi paper present a new model that employ deep convolut neural network within a gaussian-bernoulli limited-tim for adult content imag recognit of a wide varieti in a precis and effect manner
there are variou layer within convolut neural network for featur extract and classif
gaussian-bernoulli limited-tim wa use for featur extract to describ the imag and these featur were summar use the boltzmann machin limit in the featur summari phase
the benefit of such an approach is conveni in carri out featur extract
addit when test on the most modern criterion dataset thi find is believ to be more precis compar to other state-of-the-art approach
the result obtain prove that the propos approach lead to a higher effici .
