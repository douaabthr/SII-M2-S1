track and field train state analysi base on acceler sensor and deep learn
one action of a human is complet under the control of the relev system of bodi
the realiz of movement is complex divers and detail with flexibl and variabl that cannot be achiev by machineri
human motion analysi and recognit is a challeng research topic that play an essenti role in promot bionic engin medic engin sport competit and game anim
the tradit human motion estim method reli heavili on imag segment so it may be affect by inaccur segment in the process of athlet movement detect result in error in the follow analysi
thi paper propos a track and field train state recognit method base on the acceler sensor and deep learn algorithm
the propos method use an acceler sensor to detect the accur motion inform of the human bodi in real-tim and a deep learn method to process and analyz the data which can provid robust data and analysi result even in inclement weather such as on raini or snowi day
the propos method doe not reli on unstabl imag segment or percept result
howev it onli carri out state analysi through real-tim sensor data which can provid robust analysi result of track and field train
practic test show that the propos method is robust stabl and robust to sensor and motion nois
at the same time thi method can provid more accur motion estim and state analysi
base on the valid of the public dataset utd-mhad the propos method significantli improv action recognit accuraci .
