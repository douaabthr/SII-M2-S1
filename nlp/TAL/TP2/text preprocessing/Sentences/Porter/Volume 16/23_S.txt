cat hunt optim algorithm a novel optim algorithm
thi articl introduc a new version of cat behavior in hunt
cat hunt optim cho algorithm unlik cat optim algorithm search strategi is not limit to track and attack
the cho algorithm ha variou behavior such as chang the natur of the search from global to local creat the number of posit base on the merit of a point for the cat to roam search between the optim space and the current solut search strategi at the graviti point of the solut and so on
the advantag of the propos algorithm over the standard cat algorithm is that the answer do not attack the prey quickli and thi provid a chanc to find more effici solut in the global search
in the propos method for intellig search the problem space of the search radiu around the optim solut chang in a new way base on trigonometr relat such as cosin
the cho algorithm consid a kind of individu learn between cat and experienc cat inspir young cat to identifi optim solut
experi on a set of standard benchmark function show that in most of the function the optim calcul error of the cho is less than sho goa gwo fa de pso coa algorithm
implement on the experi show that in the most exam the cho ha the first rank in term of the accuraci of the global optim calcul in the frieden test
the cho algorithm offer less cost in solv engin optim problem than woa ldf and hho algorithm .
