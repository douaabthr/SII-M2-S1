quantum entangl inspir grey wolf optim algorithm and it applic
meta-heurist optim algorithm are becom increasingli popular for their simplic and effici
grey wolf optim gwo is one such effect algorithm that wa propos recent
it ha been research extens owe to it impress characterist easi to understand and implement few paramet to be tune capabl to balanc explor and exploit and high solut accuraci
but in solv high depend or complex optim problem gwo can stagnat into local optima owe to poor explor strategi and can converg prematur
to overcom these drawback of gwo we propos quantum entangl enhanc grey wolf optim qegwo
quantum entangl is particularli use in significantli improv the treatment of multimod and high depend problem
one more element local search is use and is help in the search intensif
the qegwo algorithm is benchmark on 12 standard benchmark function unimod as well as multimod and result are compar with some exist variant of gwo
further it is also benchmark on congress of evolutionari computing-2019 cec 19 benchmark set consist of 10 shift and rotat function
further the applic of the qegwo is test over harmon estim design problem
a bench of smooth and noisi function is employ to test estim accuraci of qegwo
the result reveal that qegwo perform significantli better as compar to other gwo variant .
