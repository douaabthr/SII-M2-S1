modifi gener adversari network for imag classif
in the imag classif task the exist neural network model have insuffici abil to character the featur of the classifi object which lead to the problem of low recognit accuraci
therefor we propos a modifi gener adversari network gan for imag classif
base on the tradit gener adversari network by construct multipl gener model and introduc collabor mechan the gener model can learn from each other and make progress togeth in the train process to improv the fit abil of the model for real data and further improv the classif qualiti
final a gener adversari network is design to gener the occlus sampl so that the model ha good robust for the occlus object recognit
the top-1 error rate is use as the evalu index
the experi are conduct on the public data set contain cifar10 cifar100 imagenet2012
the comparison experi result show that the propos method can improv the featur represent abil of the gan and improv the accuraci of imag classif
the averag accuraci is higher than 90% and the error rate is lower than 1.0% .
