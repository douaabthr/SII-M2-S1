disparity-aug trajectori for human activ recognit
numer method for human activ recognit har have been propos in the past two decad
mani of these method are base on spars represent which describ the whole video content by a set of local featur
trajectori as mid-level spars featur are capabl of describ the movement of interest point in two-dimension 2d space
howev 2d trajectori might be affect by viewpoint chang potenti decreas their accuraci
in thi paper we first propos and compar differ 2d trajectory-bas algorithm for human activ recognit
then we propos a new way of augment 2d trajectori with dispar inform without the calcul of the 3d reconstruct
our obtain har result have shown a 2.76% improv when use disparity-aug trajectori compar to use classic 2d trajectori inform onli
furthermor we have also test our method on the challeng hollywood 3d dataset on which we have obtain competit result at a much faster speed .
