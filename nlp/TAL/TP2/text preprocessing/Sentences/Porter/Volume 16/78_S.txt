a new fission fusion behavior-bas rao algorithm ffbbra for solv optim problem
there are variou problem in the engin field which can be model as an optim problem and can be solv through metaheurist optim algorithm
in thi paper a new metaheurist algorithm name as fission fusion behavior-bas rao algorithm ffbbra ha been propos
thi new algorithm util the concept of metaphor-less rao algorithm and the idea of fission fusion social behavior of spider monkey optim smo
the propos methodolog divid the entir popul into subpopul and then these subpopul are independ updat concern their local worst and global best candid use the ffbbra equat
the propos method ha been test over 20 unconstrain function includ multimod unimod and fix dimens benchmark function along with 2 constrain benchmark function
the perform of the propos algorithm is evalu through observ of the worst solut the best solut standard deviat and mean solut
converg analysi is also perform
the propos ffbbra ha shown good perform as observ by friedman test
thi propos algorithm is also easili util on parallel system due to it parallel work natur .
