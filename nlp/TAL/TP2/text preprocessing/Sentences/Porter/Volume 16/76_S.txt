hybrid machin learn method combin with comput vision approach to estim biophys paramet of pastur
with popul growth the search for technolog that enabl improv in product respect the environ and peopl s health ha becom an essenti point for societi
in thi context thi paper present a studi base on comput vision techniqu and machin learn ml to extract inform from pasturespanicum maximumcv
br zuri to assist in the manag and research on pastur condit possibilitando a obtenção de informaçõ da
comput vision approach are use to extract biophys paramet from imag acquir orthogon from the canopi of veget
the extract inform serv as input for machin learn ml method to predict pastur height and biomass
the contribut of thi paper is develop a possibl new solut compar to tradit method in the large-scal studi of plant biophys paramet which can be labori and costli and sometim depend on destruct harvest
for thi three techniqu were use support vector regress multi-lay perceptron mlp and least absolut shrinkag and select
in addit the differenti evolut techniqu wa use to select the best model
thirti independ run of the differenti evolut techniqu were perform to assess the approach s perform
the cross-valid method result show the mlp obtain the best result reach an averag of coeffici of determin r 2 equal 0.496 to estim biomass and 0.656 to estim the pastur height .
