driver drowsi detect use modifi deep learn architectur
thi paper propos a non-invas approach to detect driver drowsi
the facial featur are use for detect the driver s drowsi
the mouth and eye region are extract from the video frame
these extract region are appli on hybrid deep learn model for drowsi detect
a hybrid deep learn model is propos by incorpor both modifi inceptionv3 and long short-term memori lstm network
inceptionv3 is modifi by ad global averag pool layer for spatial robust and dropout techniqu to prevent overfit on train data
the propos hybrid model is compar with convolut neural network incpetionv3 and lstm over nthu-ddd dataset
the propos model perform better than the other model in term of perform measur
the propos model is abl to detect driver fatigu effect .
