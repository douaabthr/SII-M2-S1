metaverse-driven remot manag solut for scene-bas energi storag power station
the metavers is a new internet applic and social form that integr a varieti of new technolog
with the carbon peak carbon neutral goal and the propos of a new power system the construct of a power system in the metavers is the trend of futur develop
for the applic of the metavers in the power system the metavers is recogn by mean of digit twin technolog internet of thing technolog and other mean and then the energi storag power station system in the metavers is analyz
to thi end thi paper propos a metaverse-driven remot manag scheme for energi storag power station and give a specif design scheme
with the help of large-scal comput experi and the parallel execut of virtual and real close loop the remot manag and virtual-r interact of the real energi storag power station system is realiz and the energi storag power station system is promot from the manag and control that reli on simul to the intellig manag and control driven by the metavers
in addit in view of the demand of energi storag power station system for high-precis power load predict thi paper also propos a power load predict model base on genet algorithm-bp neural network
consid the data characterist a scene-bas classif model gener method is design
the simul result show that compar with the bp neural network algorithm the perform of the predict model propos in thi paper ha been significantli improv and it can achiev effect predict of power load .
