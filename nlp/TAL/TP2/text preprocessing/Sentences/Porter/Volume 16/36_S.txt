a new approach base on exponenti entropi with modifi kernel fuzzi c-mean cluster for mri brain segment
imag cluster is one of the most import and challeng process of digit imag process and comput vision refer to partit an imag into meaning region
in medic imag the segment of anatom magnet reson imag mri is a crucial step to a multitud of applic includ computer-aid diagnosi monitor of cancer patholog morphometr analysi and visual of human tissu
unfortun mr imag contain intens inhomogen and nois produc by the scan tool can lead to inaccur and unreli result segment
in thi context we propos a robust and effici fuzzi cluster method call modifi kernel with exponenti entropi mk2e which is introduc by modifi the kernel fuzzi c-mean method and by incorpor the fuzzi exponenti entropi and a logarithm penalti term
moreov we have examin an import theoret question regard the mathemat properti behind our fuzzi mk2e cluster algorithm such as converg
experi were perform on normal brain imag from t1-weight mri scan with vari nois level and intens inhomogen
the result illustr the superior of our propos method over other six compar method in term of accuraci segment and execut time .
