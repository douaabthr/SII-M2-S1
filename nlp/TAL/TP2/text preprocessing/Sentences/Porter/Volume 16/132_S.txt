cybernet a hybrid deep cnn with n-gram featur select for cyberbulli detect in onlin social network
cyberbulli is an experi that creat neg impact on individu
becaus of the begin of the social network cyberbulli becom seriou issu
state of art machin learn base approach outperform to provid the maximum accuraci at charact level detect of abus word caus cyberbulli
to achiev the promin accuraci in thi paper we adopt the deep learn mechan with seven layer convolut neural network cnn model with n-gram featur select name as hybrid deep cnn hdcnn
by util thi model in four stage architectur the word level and charact level cyberbulli detect perform effect
even though the attack creat the neg impact on social network use varieti of uncategor and abus word
to solv thi problem thi research work majorli focus on synonym-charact level cyberbulli detect which is refer as cybernet model here after
the propos cybernet model train with synonym of all word with charact to prevent malici user from send cyberbulli text in no possibl way
experiment result conduct on real world dataset the qualit result analysi prove that the propos approach provid much better perform compar to the convent approach .
