toward fair machin learn use combinatori method
with the rise of artifici intellig and machin learn in the last decad there ha been an increas interest in develop a solid theori and implement algorithm fair which ha eventu result in a larg volum of work over the past few year
despit the enorm amount of work done on the topic over a concis period there ha been littl consensu of a unifi theori of algorithm fair
in thi paper we develop a notion of fair that is base on the notion of discrep of set system a wide studi topic in the theori of comput scienc and combinator
