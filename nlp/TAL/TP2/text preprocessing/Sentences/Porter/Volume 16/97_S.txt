evalu method of outward-bound base on neural network
outward-bound is of great signific in physic educ
how to use the neural network model for the outward-bound evalu in order to provid trainer and traine with train paramet that can be refer to for each extens exercis
thi not onli evalu the effect of each stretch but also quantifi variou metric of each stretch such as safeti effici train intens and more
in thi paper we propos an evalu model for outward-bound base on the neural network which is a comput intellig method to provid trainer and traine with train paramet that can be refer to for each extens exercis
first we analyz and categor differ type of outreach program
second we extract differ indic as featur data accord to the learn process of outbound train
third we adopt the power learn abil of a neural network to make evalu analysi
final we experiment verifi the effect of the propos method .
