hybrid chaotic system-ori artifici fish swarm neural network for imag encrypt
accord to the research work of the refer on chaotic cryptanalysi mani recent chaotic imag encrypt algorithm cannot resist chosen-plaintext attack
although some chaotic imag encrypt algorithm introduc plain-imag inform they still violat some design requir of modern cryptosystem
the tradit imag encrypt algorithm ha the disadvantag of low secur and time-consum
therefor after analyz mani literatur relat to chaotic imag encrypt and aim to improv the secur of ciphertext and effect resist plaintext attack we propos a hybrid chaotic system-ori artifici fish swarm neural network method for imag encrypt
firstli base on the nonlinear combin theori the logist tent and sine map are use to design the hybrid complex chaotic system
accord to the pixel valu of plaintext it gener the initi valu to output the chaotic sequenc
take a chaotic sequenc as the input layer the artifici neural network is introduc to train and learn the chaotic sequenc
it elimin the chaotic period and output the neural network sequenc
the artifici fish swarm algorithm is use to optim the initi weight and threshold of the elman neural network
the set obfusc method is defin to scrambl the plaintext
a quantiz method is construct to quantifi the neural network sequenc and obtain the key flow
the mix imag are classifi the key flow is combin the pixel valu is chang and the ciphertext is output by design the piecewis diffus technolog
experiment result show that compar with the current state-of-the-art imag encrypt method the propos algorithm ha higher secur and resist plaintext attack abil .
