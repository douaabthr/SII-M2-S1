multi-scal multi-stream deep network for car logo recognit
vehicl logo retriev or recognit is be a popular studi of field in intelligent/smart traffic system
therefor thi paper propos a multi-scal multi-stream deep network for vehicl logo recognit
the propos network process the input vehicl logo imag through each of the multi-scal stream to extract the robust featur follow by the logo recognit modul
the propos network follow the knowledg share strategi by share learn featur at each stream across the network
we have util the exist large-scal benchmark vehicl logo imag dataset to valid the propos network for vehicl logo recognit task
the perform of the propos network is compar with the exist state-of-the-art deep network which exhibit that the propos network is superior for the vehicl recognit task .
