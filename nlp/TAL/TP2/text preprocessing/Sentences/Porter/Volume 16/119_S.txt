reduc the number of function evalu in derivative-fre algorithm for bound constrain optim
in thi paper we present a derivative-fre algorithm base on modifi minim posit base for bound constrain optim problem
compar with the derivative-fre algorithm base on the maxim 2nposit base the algorithm base on the minim n 1 posit base onli need at most n 1 function evalu at everi iter whereni the number of variabl
therefor we can reduc the number of function evalu from 2nto n 1 at each iter
but the minim posit base can caus undesir larg angl between some posit base direct and larg unexplor feasibl domain
in order to overcom thi defect we propos a modifi set of feasibl direct base on the minim posit base and the techniqu of search direct rotat to investig the unexplor domain at the next iter
accordingli converg to stationari point is prove
moreov the numer experi show that the method base on modifi minim posit base can reduc the number of function evalu and is benefici in a derivative-fre context .
