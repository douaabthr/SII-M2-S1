quadrat assign problem a landscap analysi
the anatomi of the fit landscap for the quadrat assign problem is studi in thi paper
we studi the properti of both random problem and real-world problem
use auto-correl as a measur for the landscap rugged we studi the landscap of the problem and show how thi properti is relat to the problem matric with which the problem are repres
our main goal in thi paper is to studi new properti of the fit landscap which have not been studi befor and we believ are more capabl of reflect the problem difficulti
use local search algorithm which exhaust explor the plateau and the local optima we explor the landscap store all the local optima we find and studi their properti
the properti we studi includ the time it take for a local search algorithm to find local optima the number of local optima the probabl of reach the global optimum the expect cost of the local optima around the global optimum and the basin of attract of the global and local optima
we studi the properti for problem of differ size and through extrapol we show how the properti chang with the system size and whi the problem becom harder as the system size grow
in our studi we show how the real-world problem are similar to or differ from the random problem
we also tri to show what properti of the problem matric make the landscap of the real problem be differ from or similar to one anoth .
