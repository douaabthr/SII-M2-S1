xcs-sl a rule-bas genet learn system for sequenc label
sequenc label is an interest classif domain where like normal classif everi input ha a class label but unlik normal classif predict of an input s label may depend on the valu of other input or their class and so a learner may need to refer to input and class at differ time stamp to classifi the current input
thi is more difficult becaus a learner doe not know where and how mani input are need to classifi the current input
our interest is in learn gener rule for sequenc label
the xc algorithm is a rule-bas knowledg discoveri system power by a genet algorithm which ha often been use for classif
here we present xcs-sl an extens of xc classifi system which can be applic to sequenc label
toward an applic of learn classifi system lc to sequenc label we propos a new classifi condit with memori call a variable-length condit and a rule-discoveri system for the new classifi condit which enabl xc to appli it to sequenc label
in xcs-sl classif rule call classifi here can includ extra condit on previou input which act as memori
in sequenc label the number of conditions/memori need may be differ for each input henc use a fix number of condit i.e. fixed-length condit for all classifi is not a good solut
instead xcs-sl classifi have a variable-length condit to provid more or less memori
the genet algorithm can grow and shrink condit to find a suitabl memori size
on two synthet benchmark problem xcs-sl learn optim classifi and on a real-world sequenc label task it deriv high classif accuraci and discov interest knowledg that show depend between input at differ time
the comprehens describ system is the first applic of a lc to sequenc label and we consid it a promis direct for futur work .
