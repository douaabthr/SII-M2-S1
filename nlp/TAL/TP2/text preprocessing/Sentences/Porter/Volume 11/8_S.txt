genet modifi glowworm swarm optim base privaci preserv in cloud comput for healthcar sector
cloud comput is a comput paradigm that provid vibrant access infrastructur for data applic and file storag as well
thi technolog advanc benefit in a signific lessen of consumpt cost applic host content storag as well as deliveri and henc the concept appear gradual more in all entiti that exploit in the healthcar sector
under such circumst effici analysi and data extract from a cloud environ is more challeng
moreov the extract data ha to be preserv for privaci
to handl these challeng thi paper ha come out with a privacy-preserv algorithm in both data sanit and data restor process
further sever research have contribut advanc in the restor process yet the accuraci of restor seem to be veri low
as a solut to thi problem thi paper use a hybrid algorithm term as genet modifi glowworm swarm for both data sanit and data restor process
further the develop hybrid model compar it perform with other convent model like convent glowworm swarm optim firefli particl swarm optim artifici bee coloni crow search group search optim and genet algorithm in term of statist analysi sanit and restor effect converg analysi and key sensit analysi and the domin of the develop model is prove .
