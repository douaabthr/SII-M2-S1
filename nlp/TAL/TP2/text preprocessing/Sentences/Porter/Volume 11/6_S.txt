crow search algorithm with discret wavelet transform to aid mumford shah inpaint model
inpaint play a signific role in solv a varieti of imag process issu that compris zoom remov of impuls nois remov of scratch etc
these specifi signific are all associ to inpaint in imag domain
even though more advanc inpaint model have been introduc it suffer from problem of have low qualiti
henc thi paper intend to develop a novel inpaint model on the basi of ms model
initi the pre-process of the imag is done by discret waveley transform dwt and further it given to ms inpaint model
moreov the filter coeffici in dwt algorithm is optim by crow search algorithm csa that is be consid as the main object
as the result imag involv more scratch thi propos model necessit smoothen imag model use reproduc kernel hilbert smooth rkh
with all these techniqu the propos inpaint model is term as crow search optim dwt kernel-bas ms codwtk-m
dure the perform analysi the propos method is compar over variou tradit inpaint model like ms dwt-base ms dwt kernel-bas ms and dragonfli optim dwt kernel-bas ms dodwtk-m in term of sever measur and prove the superior of propos inpaint model .
