optim paramet of tig weld process use grey wolf optim concern 15cdv 6 steel
weld is a fabric process that join materi by caus fusion
even though there avail variou weld type like mig/mag and mma weld they need addit electrod while do weld process
aspir of thi paper is to introduc tungsten inert ga tig weld via an optim approach name grey wolf optim gwo that is system for high-qual weld process and with thi aspect it discov the impact of tig weld process paramet on the weld bead profil of 15cdv 6 high strength low alloy hsla steel
furthermor the use gwo algorithm effect recogn the optim weld constraint for increas the depth of penetr dop and reduc bead width bw as well as heat-affect zone haz width as well
the cooper variabl for model investig are weld current wec torch speed to ga flow rate gar torch angl tog and arc gap arg
the investig is process undertak certain respond factor like dop bw and haz width
the supplementari factor of the propos model show it benefici work through of 15cdv 6 steel in progress rocket-motor hardwar program engin work in industri level pressur vessel fabric and so on
the attain outcom have demonstr it extrem level of benefit in some of the strategi which util 15cdv 6 steel in rocket-motor hardwar program industri pressur vessel fabric and so on .
