recombin oper and select strategi for evolutionari markov chain mont carlo algorithm
markov chain mont carlo mcmc method are often use to sampl from intract target distribut
some mcmc variant aim to improv the perform by run a popul of mcmc chain
in thi paper we investig the use of techniqu from evolutionari comput ec to design population-bas mcmc algorithm that exchang use inform between the individu chain
we investig how one can ensur that the result class of algorithm calledevolutionari mcmc emcmc sampl from the target distribut as expect from ani mcmc algorithm
we analyt and experiment show use exampl from discret search space that the propos emcmc can outperform standard mcmc by exploit common partial structur between the more like individu state
the mcmc chain in the popul interact through recombin and select
we analyz the requir properti of recombin oper and accept or select rule in emcmc
an import issu is how to preserv the detail balanc properti which is a suffici condit for an irreduc and aperiod emcmc to converg to a given target distribut
transfer ec techniqu to population-bas mcmc should be done with care
for instanc we prove that emcmc algorithm with an elitist accept rule do not sampl the target distribut correctli .
