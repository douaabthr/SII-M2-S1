composit of web servic through genet program
web servic are interfac that describ a collect of oper that are network-access through standard web protocol
when a requir oper is not found sever servic can be compound to get a composit servic that perform the desir task
to find thi composit servic a search process in a gener huge search space must be perform
the algorithm that compos the servic must select the adequ atom process and also must choos the correct way to combin them use the differ avail control structur
in thi paper a genet program algorithm for web servic composit is present
the algorithm ha a context-fre grammar to gener the valid structur of the composit servic and also it includ a method to updat the attribut of each node
moreov the propos tri to minim the number of servic and look for composit with the minimum execut path
a full experiment valid with four differ repositori with up to 1,090 web servic ha been done show a great perform in all the test as the algorithm find a valid solut with a short execut path .
