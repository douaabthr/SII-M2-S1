memet pareto differenti evolutionari artifici neural network to determin growth multi-class in predict microbiolog
the main object of thi research is to automat design artifici neural network model with sigmoid basi unit for multiclassif task in predict microbiolog
the classifi obtain achiev a doubl object a high classif level in the dataset and high classif level for each class
the memet pareto differenti evolut neural network chosen to learn the structur and weight of the neural network is a differenti evolutionari approach base on the pareto differenti evolut multiobject evolutionari algorithm
the pareto differenti evolut algorithm is augment with a local search use the improv resili backpropag with backtrack irprop algorithm
to analyz the robust of thi methodolog it ha been appli to two complex classif problem in predict microbiolog staphylococcu aureusandshigella flexneri
the result obtain show that the gener abil and the classif rate in each class can be more effici improv within thi multiobject algorithm .
