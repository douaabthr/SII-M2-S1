genetic-bas machin learn system are competit for pattern recognit
dure the last decad research ongenetic-bas machin learningha result in sever propos of supervis learn methodolog that useevolutionari algorithmsto evolv rule-bas classif model
usual these new gbml approach are accompani by littl experiment and there is a lack of comparison among differ propos
besid the competit of gbml system with respect to non-evolutionari highly-us machin learn techniqu ha onli been partial studi
thi paper review the state of the art in gbml select some of the best repres of differ famili and compar the accuraci and the interpret of their model
the paper also analyz the behavior of the gbml approach with respect to some of the most influenti machin learn techniqu that belong to differ learn paradigm such as decis tree support vector machin instance-bas classifi and probabilist classifi
the experiment observ emphas the suitabl of gbml system for perform classif task
moreov the analysi point out the strength of the differ system which can be use as recommend guidelin on which system should be employ depend on whether the user prefer to maxim the accuraci or the interpret of the model .
