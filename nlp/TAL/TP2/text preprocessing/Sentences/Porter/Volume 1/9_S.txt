improv the reliabl of real-tim embed system use innat immun techniqu
previou work ha shown that immune-inspir techniqu have good potenti for solv problem associ with the develop of real-tim embed system rte where for variou reason tradit real-tim develop techniqu are not suitabl
thi paper examin in more detail the gener applic of the dendrit cell algorithm dca to the problem of task schedul in rte
to make thi possibl an understand of the problem characterist is formalis such that the result produc by the dca can be examin in relat to the overal problem difficulti
the paper then contain a detail understand of how well the dca which demonstr that it gener perform well howev it clearli identifi properti of anomali that are difficult to detect
these properti are as anticip base on real-tim schedul theori .
