evolut of intern dynam for neural network node
most artifici neural network have node that appli a simpl static transfer function such as a sigmoid or gaussian to their accumul input
thi contrast with biolog neuron whose transfer function are dynam and driven by a rich intern structur
our artifici neural network approach which we callstate-enhanc neural network use node with dynam transfer function base onn-dimension real-valu intern state
thi intern state provid the node with memori of past input and comput
the state updat rule which determin the intern dynam of a node are optim by an evolutionari algorithm to fit a particular task and environ
we demonstr the effect of the approach in comparison to certain type of recurr neural network use a suit of partial observ markov decis process as test problem
these problem involv both sequenc detect and simul mice in maze and includ four advanc benchmark propos by other research .
