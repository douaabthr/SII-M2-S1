adapt ε-rank on many-object problem
thi work propos adapt ε-rank to enhanc pareto base select aim to develop effectivemany-object evolutionari optim algorithm
ε-rank fine grain rank of solut after they have been rank by pareto domin use a random sampl procedur combin with ε-domin to favor a good distribut of the sampl
in the propos method sampl solut keep their initi rank and solut locat within the virtual expand ε-domin region of the sampl solut are demot to an inferior rank
the paramet ε that determin the expand region of domin of the sampl solut is adapt at each gener so that the number of best-rank solut is kept close to a desir number that is express as a fraction of the popul size
we enhanc nsga-ii with the propos method and analyz it perform on mnk-landscap show that the adapt method work effect and that compar to nsga-ii converg and divers of solut can be improv remark on mnk-landscap with 3 m 10 object
also we compar the perform of adapt ε-rank with two repres many-object evolutionari algorithm on dtlz continu function
result on dtlz function with 3 m 10 object suggest that the three many-object approach emphas differ area of object space and could be use as complementari strategi to produc a better approxim of the pareto front .
