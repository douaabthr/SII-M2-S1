numer simplif for bloat control and analysi of build block in genet program
in tree-bas genet program there is a tendenc for the size of the program to increas from gener to gener a phenomenon known as bloat
it is standard practic to place some form of control on program size either by limit the number of node or the depth of the program tree or by ad a compon to the fit function that reward smaller program parsimoni pressur
other have propos directli simplifi individu program use algebra method
in thi paper we add node-bas numer simplif as a tree prune criterion to control program size
we investig the effect of on-lin program simplif both algebra and numer on program size and resourc usag
we also investig the distribut of build block within a genet program popul and how thi is chang by use simplif
we show that simplif result in reduct in expect program size memori use and comput time
we also show that numer simplif perform at least as well as algebra simplif and in some case will outperform algebra simplif
we further show that although the two on-lin simplif method destroy some exist build block they effect gener new more divers build block dure evolut which compens for the neg effect of disrupt of build block .
