improv the perform of evolutionari algorithm in grid-bas puzzl resolut
thi paper propos sever modif to exist hybrid evolutionari algorithm in grid-bas puzzl use a-priori probabl of 0 1 occurr in binari encod
thi calcul of a-priori probabl of bit is possibl in grid-bas problem puzzl in thi case due to their special structur with the solut confin into a grid
the work is focus in two differ grid-bas puzzl the japanes puzzl and the light-up puzzl each one have special characterist in term of constraint which must be taken into account for the probabl of bit calcul
for these puzzl we show the process of a-priori probabl calcul and we modifi the initi of the ea to improv their perform
we also includ novel mutat oper base on a-priori probabl which make more effect the evolutionari search of the algorithm in the tackl puzzl
the perform of the algorithm with these new initi and novel mutat oper is compar with the perform without them
we show that the new initi and oper base on a-priori probabl of bit make the evolutionari search more effect and also improv the scalabl of the algorithm .
