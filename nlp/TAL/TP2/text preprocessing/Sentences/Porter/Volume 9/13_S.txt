enhanc multiobject population-bas increment learn with applic in risk treati optim
the purpos of thi paper is to revisit the multiobject population-bas increment learn method and show how it perform can be improv in the context of a real-world financi optim problem
the propos enhanc lead to both better perform and improv in the qualiti of solut which can repres million of dollar for the insur compani in term of recoveri
it perform wa assess in term of runtim and speedup when parallel
also metric such as the averag number of solut the averag hypervolum and coverag have been use in order to compar the pareto frontier obtain by both the origin and enhanc method
result indic that the propos method is 22.1% faster present more solut in the averag better defin the pareto frontier and often gener solut have larger hypervolum
the method achiev a speedup of 15.7 on 16 core of a dual socket intel multi-cor machin when solv a reinsur contract optim problem involv 15 layer or sub-contract .
