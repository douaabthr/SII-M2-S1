an upper and lower cusum for signal normal in the dendrit cell algorithm
signal normal is a part of signal formal which is a vital data pre-process constraint requir for the function of the dendrit cell algorithm
in exist applic most normal algorithm are develop purpos for a specif applic with draw on human domain expertis and veri few algorithm are design for gener problem
thi make it difficult for the inexperienc user to exploit exist approach to anoth problem particularli when the initi inform about the problem is limit
therefor thi studi propos a new signal normal method for the dendrit cell algorithm that use the statist upper and lower cumul sum so that the algorithm can be appli to gener classif problem
in addit a new method to calcul the anomali threshold base on the averag mature-contact antigen valu is present to suit the propos algorithm
the propos model is evalu by appli it to eight univers classif dataset and assess it perform accord to four measur metric detect rate specif fals alarm rate and accuraci
it perform is compar with that of the exist dendrit cell algorithm and four non-bio-inspir classifi name rough set decis tree naïv bay and multilay perceptron
the result show that the propos model outperform the exist model and the other classifi as well as demonstr a signific improv in term of specif fals alarm rate and accuraci for all dataset
thi indic that the propos normal approach can be appli to gener classif problem and can improv detect perform .
