select and estim interest rate model with evolutionari method
select and estim parsimoni model is often desir but hard to achiev
thi is particularli true when model can potenti contain a veri larg number of paramet but data are scarc as is the case for mani macro-econom model in gener and interest-r model in particular
these model need to cater for a larg number of potenti relationship and depend but are fit on low-frequ data to focu on the bigger pictur and long-term effect
to identifi the ideal model and estim it is then particularli demand from an optim perspect
in thi paper we suggest an evolutionari approach that consid model select and estim simultan
numer experi with artifici data suggest that the approach is well suit for thi type of problem
in an empir applic for short-term and long-term interest rate denomin in us dollar euro and the japanes yen respect parsimoni model structur are identifi that highlight the depend as well as spill-ov across matur and currenc .
