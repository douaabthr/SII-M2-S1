Multi-sensor target tracking algorithm combining node energy planning and distributed collaboration

The traditional target tracking algorithm can only utilize the information of a single sensor and cannot fully utilize the advantages of multiple sensors. To address this issue, this study designs a multi-sensor target tracking algorithm based on node capacity planning and distributed collaboration. First, aiming at the problem of distributed tracking application in multi-sensor networks, a wireless sensor target tracking algorithm based on node energy constraints is constructed. By constructing a node tracking model, the energy consumption is reduced according to the distributed connection network and node planning is introduced. Then, for sensor networks with limited energy, a node planning algorithm using convex relaxation method is developed to solve complex integer programming problems. Finally, in view of the various complex problems existing in the sensor network, a distributed social learning algorithm based on its own data and neighboring decision-making is established. This algorithm ultimately improves the performance of the multi-sensor target tracking algorithm by transmitting decisions about environmental states. The results demonstrated that in the convergence comparison between the TrackingNet dataset and the MOT 15 dataset, the convergence of research algorithm began to stabilize when the system was iterated 106 and 48 times, respectively. In addition, when the system iterated to 200 and 157 times, the error of the algorithm slowly began to level off and was at a smaller value. The above results show that the research algorithm has achieved better performance in multi-sensor target tracking tasks. It can better handle the relationship between targets and improve the effect of target tracking.
