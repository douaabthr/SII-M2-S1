COVID-19 pneumonia level detection using deep learning algorithm and transfer learning

The first COVID-19 confirmed case was reported in Wuhan, China, and spread across the globe with an unprecedented impact on humanity. Since this pandemic requires pervasive diagnosis, developing smart, fast, and efficient detection techniques is significant. To this end, we have developed an Artificial Intelligence engine to classify the lung inflammation level (mild, progressive, severe stage) of the COVID-19 confirmed patient. In particular, the developed model consists of two phases; in the first phase, we calculate the volume and density of lesions and opacities of the CT scan images of the confirmed COVID-19 patient using Morphological approaches. The second phase classifies the pneumonia level of the confirmed COVID-19 patient. We use a modified Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and k-Nearest Neighbor; we also compared the results of both models to the other classification algorithms to precisely classify lung inflammation. The experiments show that the CNN model can provide testing accuracy up to 95.65% compared with exiting classification techniques. The proposed system in this work can be applied efficiently to CT scan and X-ray image datasets. Also, in this work, the Transfer Learning technique has been used to train the pre-trained modified CNN model on a smaller dataset than the original dataset; the modified CNN achieved 92.80% of testing accuracy for detecting pneumonia on chest X-ray images for the relatively extensive dataset.
