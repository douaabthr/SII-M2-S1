Hybridization of chaos theory and dragonfly algorithm to maximize spatial area coverage of swarm robots

Swarm robotics show collective behavior in order to work in multi agent scenario, where spatial area coverage is an emergent area of research. This work introduces a hybrid technique for optimized spatial area coverage. A combination of Dragonfly Algorithm (DA) and chaotic mapping is proposed and the entire study is carried out in two phases. In the first phase, DA’s parameters are measured on the basis of percentage of area covered, entropy and number of pop-up threats detected. In the second phase, Chaotic distribution is applied in swarm algorithms (i.e. DA along with Bat Algorithm and Accelerated Particle Swarm Optimization) to implement hybridized models. Chaotic Dragonfly Algorithm along with Chaotic Bat Algorithm and Chaotic Accelerated Particle Swarm Optimization) is implemented. To evaluate the performance of hybridized models, a comprehensive comparison is drawn among the Levy and Chaotic versions of all three swarm algorithms. It is concluded that the proposed DA outperforms the rest. DA not only showed better results for the mentioned metrics, but also displayed uniform behavior over multiple runs.
