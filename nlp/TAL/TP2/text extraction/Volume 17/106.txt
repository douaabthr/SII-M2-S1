Optimal allocation of water resources in Guyuan City based on improved NSGA-III algorithm

In order to alleviate the problem of water resources shortage and unequal distribution in time and space in Guyuan City, this paper firstly analyzes the basic situation of water resources in Guyuan City, and constructs a multi-objective optimal allocation model of water resources with economic benefits, social benefits and ecological benefits as the objectives. Then, NSGA-III algorithm is proposed to solve the optimal allocation scheme of water resources. Based on the original NSGA-III algorithm, multi-point crossover operator and multi-point mutation operator, namely non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-III with Random multipoint crossover mutation(RNSGA-III), are used. In the selection of the next generation, SAW and MCDM schemes were used to evaluate the chromosomes and set the weights to achieve better and more ideal results. Finally, the proposed scheme is compared with the existing configuration scheme based on NSGA-III and NSGA-II algorithms. Simulation experiments show that the proposed scheme is better than the allocation scheme based on NSGA-III algorithm and NSGA-II algorithm in the comprehensive cost of economic benefits, water shortage and ecological benefits, which can provide a basis for the rational allocation of water resources in Guyuan City, achieve unified management and sustainable utilization of water resources and support the sustainable development of economy and society.
