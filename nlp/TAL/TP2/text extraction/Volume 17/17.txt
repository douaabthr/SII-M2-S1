A hybrid GA-FS algorithm with fuzzy approximation scheme for solving credibilistic reliability optimization problem

In this paper, credibilistic safety-based design optimization (CSDO) model is firstly formulated as structural reliability optimization framework with credibilistic safety constraint, and fuzzy simulation (FS) approximation is presented to handle the credibilistic safety constraint and approximate the feasible domain. Then, we introduce GA to design the hybrid GA-FS algorithm by integrating FS scheme into GA, which enables the hybrid GA-FS algorithm to solve CSDO model effectively. Finally, two numerical examples are conducted to evidence the applicability of the proposed CSDO formulation and the hybrid GA-FS algorithm in practical engineering. By using out-of-sample back-testing, we provide the comparison between the predetermined reliability level and the backtesting reliability level, which shows the effectiveness of the hybrid GA-FS algorithm for the proposed CSDO formulation.
