Revolutionizing cultural heritage preservation: an innovative IoT-based framework for protecting historical buildings

Italy offers a cultural heritage of considerable value that needs to be protected. Indeed, natural deterioration linked to the passage of time affects ancient artifacts and buildings. Sometimes, the deterioration compromises the functionality of cultural assets, pushing them toward decay. In this scenario, effective intervention seems impossible on the various critical points because of the wide variability of factors involved and the wide range of possible treatments. However, the spread of low-cost technologies has led to the possibility of having different devices and sensors able to communicate and interact with each other and humans: the Internet of Things (IoT). In this scenario, the IoT paradigm makes it possible to map reality by defining a coherent virtual representation (Digital Twin), which could help preserve Cultural Heritage. This work introduces an IoT-based system combining monitoring, predictive maintenance, and decision-making regarding the implementable interventions for protecting cultural heritage buildings. For this purpose, deep and machine learning techniques allow for the detection and classification of damages on specific materials. The experimental phase consists of two phases: the first aims to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed architecture, and the second exploits a prototype capable of interacting with expert users. The results of the experimental campaign are promising.
