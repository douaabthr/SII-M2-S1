Research on storage method for fuzzy RDF graph based on Neo4j

With the wide application of the Semantic Web and the rapid development of the Resource Description Framework (RDF), the demand for data processing of inconsistent or imprecise information has become more and more urgent. Recently, the fuzzy extension of RDF data has received widespread attention because of their ability to represent and process fuzzy information. An important issue for the success of fuzzy RDF applications is how to achieve persistent data storage and query capabilities. In this article, we investigate the storage and query of fuzzy RDF data. To accomplish this, we study how to formally map fuzzy RDF graph represented by the labeled directed graph structure to Property Graphs (PGs) database storage model. We implement the process that the mapping relationship between fuzzy RDF graph and property graph. Moreover, we manage these data by a chosen Neo4j Graph DBMS in order to support expressive querying services over the stored data. Finally, we have compared our method based on Neo4j graph database with the method based on relational database, and the experimental results prove that using the graph database model to store fuzzy RDF graph data sets is effective and feasibility.
