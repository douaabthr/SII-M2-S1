ARDOD: adaptive radius density-based outlier detection

Outlier detection has garnered considerable attention in recent years due to its wide-ranging applications across various research domains. This surge in interest has led to the development of numerous detection techniques, predominantly based on distance or density metrics. A notable limitation of these existing methods is their reliance on parameter adjustments, significantly affecting the outcome. Additionally, these methods exhibit intrinsic flaws: distance-based approaches struggle with clusters with varying local densities, while density-based methods fail to identify patterns within low-density areas. Moreover, most prior techniques are adept at identifying only one kind of outlier—local, global, or group of outliers. Addressing these challenges, we introduce the Adaptive Radius Density-Based Outlier Detection (ARDOD) method, which departs from the traditional parameter-dependent approach. ARDOD is a novel parameter-free algorithm that dynamically determines the necessary parameters based on the data distribution within the feature space. This innovative method demonstrates robust performance in detecting all three categories of outliers. The efficacy and superior performance of ARDOD are validated through an extensive experimental analysis involving various synthetic and real-world datasets. This analysis showcases ARDOD's advantages over seven established methods: Local Outlier Factor (LOF), Angle-Based Outlier Detection (ABOD), Robust Distance-Based Outlier Score (RDOS), Directed density ratio Changing Rate-based outlier detection (DCROD), Empirical-Cumulative-distribution-based Outlier Detection(ECOD), mean-shift outlier detector(MOD +),and Local–Global Outlier Detection (LGOD), underscoring its potential as a versatile tool in outlier detection research.
