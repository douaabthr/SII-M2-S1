A performance simulation and verification method of packet scheduling algorithms for data stream based on QoS

In the process of network-based data flow transmission for various applications of information services, there are some problems, such as limited bandwidth and unclear priority level of business data, which affect the end-to-end reliable transmission efficiency because the system cannot perceive the link state. Traditional parallel link redundancy schemes have not fundamentally solved the problems of invulnerability and reliability. On the basis of sorting out the demand of service data flow transmission, this paper proposes a performance verification method of data flow packet scheduling algorithm based on QoS to solve the problems of network delay and congestion, and explores a reliable end-to-end service data flow transmission mode.
