Improving navigational parameters and control of autonomous robot using hybrid SOMA–PSO technique

With the development of science and technology, robots gained their popularity in automation and industrial applications. Because of this the researchers are more focussed towards motion planning analysis of mobile robots, bipeds and humanoids. During the investigation, it was discovered that the robots are more likely to become trapped in local minima and dead ends. So, this paper aims to provide a novel hybridized artificial intelligence technique by combining the Self organizing migrating algorithm (SOMA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for optimal path planning and control of single and multiple mobile robots in a static and dynamic environment. Different parameters of SOMA and PSO algorithm guides the robots to reach global optimized path in obstacle prone environment. The developed hybrid SOMA–PSO technique is tested in V-REP simulation environment with single and multiple robots, and the simulation outcomes have been authenticated in an experimental setup under laboratory conditions. Whenever sensors detects obstacle then the SOMA–PSO activates and negotiate with obstacles to move up to specified target. After simulation and real-time experiments the proposed novel hybrid technique is successfully achieved their target in an optimized manner. Further, a comparison analysis with its standalone techniques reveals that there is a significant improvement in navigational parameters. Again, the technique is tested against existing paper and an average improvement of 17.76% is observed by using the proposed hybrid technique.
