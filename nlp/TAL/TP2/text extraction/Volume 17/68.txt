Sighted particles: improving swarm optimization by making particles aware of their surroundings

Population-based meta-heuristics use particles represented by\(d-\)dimensional points to encode candidate solutions to an optimization problem. The goal of this work is to introduce a new type of particle represented by a\(d-\)dimensional hypercube. Our new representation offers a field of view to swarm particles, making them aware of their surroundings . This gives each particle its own coverage of the search space. We evaluated the effect of our approach in the performance of seven swarm-based algorithms, including artificial bee colony, cuckoo search optimization and particle swarm optimization. We used 30 well-known benchmark functions and six different numbers of dimensions. We compared the performances of the algorithms withblindandsightedparticles using Mann-Whitney tests. The results of our extensive experiments show thatsightedparticles perform at least as well asblindones in 93% of all scenarios, across different algorithms, benchmark functions and numbers of dimensions, showing significantly better results 51% of the time. We also proposed a new scale which measures an algorithm’s exploration and exploitation capabilities and we used it to explain our results. Finally, we followed asightedswarm throughout the convergence process, showing its ability to cover large portions of the search space. Our take-home message is that any swarm algorithm can adopt our particle representation in order to improve its performance, because any method can benefit from improving its exploitation and exploration capabilities.
