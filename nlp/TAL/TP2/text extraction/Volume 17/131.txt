Robotic vision based obstacle avoidance for navigation of unmanned aerial vehicle using fuzzy rule based optimal deep learning model

Recently, the topics associated with robotics are becoming an interesting research area. Meanwhile, intelligent mobile robots or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has great acceptance; however, the navigation and control of the devices are more complex. The shortage of dealing with static obstacles and evading them due to secure and safe routing is a fundamental need of the system. Therefore, an effectual robotic obstacle avoidance mechanism using deep learning (DL) model optimized with a swarm intelligence procedure is proposed. The main aim of this method is to avoid collision with static obstacles and attain the target in an optimal path. At first, the proposed method initializes the obstacles and target places for mobile robot navigation, and their positions are collected. An innovative path planning approach is presented using adaptive beetle swarm levy flight optimization (BSLFO) for optimal path calculation. Here, distance and path smoothness parameters are considered for optimal planning by the proposed BSLFO approach. The mobile robots are moved to the best positions obtained by the BSLFO approach. Additionally, optimal robots’ movement with collision avoidance has been performed by employing a fuzzy rule based optimal deep neural network (FRDNN). The proposed method is implemented in the MATLAB platform and evaluates the performance in terms of performance metrics, including accuracy, recall, precision, and planning time. The maximum accuracy reached by the proposed method for static and dynamic obstacles is 98.62, which offers better obstacle avoidance and effective path planning. Consequently, the overall experimental outcomes proved that the proposed model outperforms the existing models.
