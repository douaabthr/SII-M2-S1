A memetic quantum-inspired genetic algorithm based on tabu search

Over the past few years, quantum-inspired genetic algorithm, as the forerunner of quantum evolutionary algorithms has made significant achievements in solving optimization problems in various fields. The ability of this algorithm to comprehensively search the problem space and discover global extrema is due to the power of the exploration process in this algorithm, which in turn is attributed to the mutations resulting from quantum rotation gates. But the best results in evolutionary algorithms are obtained when there is a reasonable balance between the exploration process (general search) and the exploitation process (local search). Under such conditions, the convergence speed of the algorithm in finding the global optima is no longer suppressed. In this research, a memetic quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm is proposed, which is a combination of a quantum genetic algorithm and a local search-based meta-heuristic called tabu search. In the proposed method, mutations of the rotation gate cover the entire problem space and access distant solutions. Consequently, the impulses generated by the tabu search in each iteration limit the range of motion and access to nearby solutions. Consecutive execution of these two processes turns the classical mutation operator into a directional mutation and accelerates the convergence of evolution. The evaluation results of this algorithm on unimodal and multimodal benchmark functions reflect the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art methods in terms of convergence rate and running time.
