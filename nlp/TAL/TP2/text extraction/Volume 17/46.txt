Node positioning based on IPSO-IDE in WSNs

Due to the unreasonable connectivity of wireless sensor networks, there are errors in calculating the distance between the location-unaware nodes and the location-aware nodes. Therefore, a novel method combining improved particle swarm optimization and improved differential evolution (IPSO-IDE) is proposed. Firstly, the learning factor of the particle swarm optimization method is modified, and the disturbance term is added to prevent premature, thus strengthening its exploration ability. Then, the adaptive mutation and crossover mechanism are applied to the differential evolution method so that each chromosome can mutate and cross adaptively with individual fitness and average fitness, to improve its exploitation ability. Finally, the improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) and differential evolution method (IDE) are run in parallel in the node positioning model. After fixed number of iterations, the optimal individual information of the two methods is shared to obtain the IPSO-IDE method. Therefore, IPSO-IDE has the advantages of both. The results show that the IPSO-IDE algorithm not only has some advantages in time complexity, but also improves the positioning accuracy by 27.2%, 8.7%, 4.5% and 5.7% respectively, compared with particle swarm optimization with a variable neighborhood algorithm, modified particle swarm optimization algorithm, hybrid particle swarm optimization and differential evolution algorithm and artificial bee colony algorithm.
