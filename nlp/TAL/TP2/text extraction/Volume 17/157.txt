Application of FUZZY-3DOF-PID controller for controlling FOPTD type communication delay based renewable three-area deregulated hybrid power system

Renewable energy promises to be a good substitute for traditional sources for a constant supply of power. Large-scale electrical grids may experience major synchronization imbalances between various components as a result of system or communication delays. Engineers experience several challenges while attempting to replace conventional energy with sustainable power since the characteristics of renewable power plant generation are continually changing with climatic conditions. To manage a time-delayed automated generation control (AGC) system, one can use intelligent control such as the FUZZY-assisted three degrees of freedom PID controller. This study presents a new control strategy called the FUZZY-3DOF-PID controller for a First-Order Plus Time-Delay (FOPTD)-based three-area interconnected hybrid power system. The controller parameters are trained by different algorithms, such as FireBug Swarm Optimization (FSO), Levenberg Marquardt Algorithm (LMA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Big Bang Big Crunch (BB-BC) Algorithm, to prove their efficacy. The designed controller is robust to load variation (RLP) and the comparison of the various performance indices demonstrates the superiority of the proposed controller over other controllers available in the literature.
