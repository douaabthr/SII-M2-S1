Learning classifier systems: then and now

Broadly conceived as computational models of cognition and tools for modeling complex adaptive systems, later extended for use in adaptive robotics, and today also applied to effective classification and data-mining–what has happened to learning classifier systems in the last decade? This paper addresses this question by examining the current state of learning classifier system research.
