An interdisciplinary perspective on artificial immune systems

This review paper attempts to position the area of Artificial Immune Systems (AIS) in a broader context of interdisciplinary research. We review AIS based on an established conceptual framework that encapsulates mathematical and computational modelling of immunology, abstraction and then development of engineered systems. We argue that AIS are much more than engineered systems inspired by the immune system and that there is a great deal for both immunology and engineering to learn from each other through working in an interdisciplinary manner.
