Genetic-based machine learning systems are competitive for pattern recognition

During the last decade, research onGenetic-Based Machine Learninghas resulted in several proposals of supervised learning methodologies that useevolutionary algorithmsto evolve rule-based classification models. Usually, these new GBML approaches are accompanied by little experimentation and there is a lack of comparisons among different proposals. Besides, the competitiveness of GBML systems with respect to non-evolutionary, highly-used machine learning techniques has only been partially studied. This paper reviews the state of the art in GBML, selects some of the best representatives of different families, and compares the accuracy and the interpretability of their models. The paper also analyzes the behavior of the GBML approaches with respect to some of the most influential machine learning techniques that belong to different learning paradigms such as decision trees, support vector machines, instance-based classifiers, and probabilistic classifiers. The experimental observations emphasize the suitability of GBML systems for performing classification tasks. Moreover, the analysis points out the strengths of the different systems, which can be used as recommendation guidelines on which systems should be employed depending on whether the user prefers to maximize the accuracy or the interpretability of the models.
