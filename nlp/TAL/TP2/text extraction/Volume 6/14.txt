Methods for approximating value functions for the Dominion card game

Artificial neural networks have been successfully used to approximate value functions for tasks involving decision making. In domains where decisions require a shift in judgment as the overall state changes, it is hypothesized here that methods utilizing multiple artificial neural networks are likely to provide a benefit as an approximation of a value function over those that employ a single network. The card game Dominion was chosen as the domain to examine this. This paper compares artificial neural networks generated by multiple machine learning methods successfully applied to other games (such as in TD-Gammon) to a genetic algorithm method for generating two neural networks for different phases of the game along with evolving the transition point. The results demonstrate a greater success ratio with the genetic algorithm applied to two neural networks. This suggests that future work examining more complex neural network configurations and richer evolutionary exploration could apply to Dominion as well as other domains necessitating shifts in strategy.
