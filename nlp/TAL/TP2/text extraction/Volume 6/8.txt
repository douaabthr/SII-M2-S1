Performance analysis of rough set ensemble of learning classifier systems with differential evolution based rule discovery

Data mining, and specifically supervised data classification, is a key application area for Learning Classifier Systems (LCS). Scaling to larger classification problems, especially to higher dimensional problems, is a key challenge. Ensemble based approaches can be applied to LCS to address scalability issues. To this end a rough set based ensemble of LCS is proposed, which relies on a pre-processed feature partitioning step to train multiple LCS on feature subspaces. Each base classifier in the ensemble is a Michigan style supervised LCS. The traditional genetic algorithm based rule evolution is replaced by a differential evolution based rule discovery, to improve generalisation capabilities of LCS. A voting mechanism is then used to generate output for test instances. This paper describes the proposed ensemble algorithm in detail, and compares its performance with different versions of base LCS on a number of benchmark classification tasks. Analysis of computational time and model accuracy show the relative merits of the ensemble algorithm and base classifiers on the tested data sets. The rough set based ensemble learning approach and differential evolution based rule searching out-perform the base LCS on classification accuracy over the data sets considered. Results also show that small ensemble size is sufficient to obtain good performance.
