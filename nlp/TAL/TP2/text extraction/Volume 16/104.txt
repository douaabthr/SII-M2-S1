Refined education mechanism based on edge computing for college student management

Refinement management originated from the concept of enterprise management and is widely used in all walks of life. It is a management method that can maximize resource utilization and reduce time costs. In the era of networking, informatization and diversification, the world outlook, values and outlook on life of contemporary college students have undergone tremendous changes. This puts forward higher requirements for the management of college students. The refined management concept and model can bring great help to the daily management of college counselors, and can have a positive impact on the learning and growth of students. In order to alleviate the shortcomings of traditional college student management systems in terms of performance, security and privacy, this paper proposes a college student management system based on edge computing. This paper selects a computing edge computing server that mainly focuses on data processing, and focuses on edge computing on the network side. By adopting data mining algorithms, the local processing of edge computing data is realized. This can reduce the delay caused by data transmission. In addition, the system enhances some functions, performance and reliability according to the characteristics of the refined management needs of college students. This paper evaluates the data storage and query efficiency of the system. From the test results, the system proposed in this paper can meet the storage query requirements of millions of data items. To evaluate the throughput performance of the system, the system proposed in this paper is compared with three other solutions. Experimental results show that this system outperforms other solutions.
