Bat competitive swarm optimizer enabled DMN for automatic recommendation of learning objects

The e-learning recommender system in the learning academies is progressively growing with respect to the preferred delivery mode, as it delegates learning anywhere, anytime. In general, e-learning systems failed to satisfy the needs of the individual learners with respect to their profiles. This research focuses on designing an automatic recommendation approach for the learners using the proposed optimization algorithm, named Bat Competitive Swarm Optimizer (BCSO). Initially, the e-learning contents are added into One Learning Repository, where the learning objects are uploaded manually as well as dynamically. The web crawler is used for the automatic content preparation by inputting the parent link with the restricted rule list. Thereafter, the categorization of the e-learning objects is done on the basis of types, topics, and preparation methods using Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Local Enhancement based Rough K-Means Clustering automatically. Once the e-learning topics are categorized, the automatic recommendation of learning objects to the user is carried out by Deep Maxout Network (DMN). Here, the training of DMN is performed based on BCSO, which is devised by the combination of Bat Algorithm with Competitive Swarm Optimizer. Furthermore, the performance of the developed approach is analyzed and compared with the existing methods. The analysis depicts that the proposed method has the precision of 0.941, recall of 0.941, and f-measure of 0.938.
