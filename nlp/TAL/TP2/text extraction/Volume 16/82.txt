Damage identification in structure elements by grasshopper optimization algorithm using dynamic structure behaviors

Timely inspection of structures is necessary to prevent damage progression and ensure the safety and efficiency of structures at the lowest cost. The existence of defects and partial failures in structures is the source of general failures and threats to the behavior of structures. In many cases, impending failure may not be apparent from its appearance. Hence, the study of structural failure is one of the essential areas of research that helps increase the structure's life and control the failure of structures. This research aims to investigate an approach for detecting damage in the structure, especially in the plates. An efficient method utilizing the Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA) as an optimization solver is presented here to detect the multiple-damage of structural systems. Accelerations changes of a structure are considered as a criterion for damage occurrence. The structural damage detection problem is first transmuted into a standard optimization problem dealing with continuous variables. Then the GOA is utilized to solve the optimization problem for finding the site and severity of structural damage. To assess the performance of the proposed method for damage identification, numerical examples with considering measurement noise are considered. All the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for accurately determining the site and severity of multiple-damage. Also, the performance of the GOA for damage detection compared to the differential evolution algorithm (DEA) is confirmed by a numerical example.
