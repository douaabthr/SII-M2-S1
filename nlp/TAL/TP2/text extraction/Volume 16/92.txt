Metaverse-driven new energy of Chinese traditional culture education: edge computing method

How to make Chinese traditional culture shine again has become the focus of our research. The emergence of the metaverse has led to further development of Virtual Reality (VR) technology. Therefore, VR technology can be relied on to create a VR world in the form of three-dimensional interaction, so that traditional culture can break through the limitations of time and space, and deepen people’s understanding of traditional Chinese culture. Due to the wide application of edge computing technology, offloading VR computing tasks to edge servers can reduce the average time latency and improve the user experience. For this reason, we design a two-phase task offloading algorithm to obtain the optimal solution of the task offloading problem by implementing Nash equilibrium. Simulation results show that the Metaverse-driven VR of Chinese traditional culture can effectively reduce the average latency, so that users can deeply experience the new energy of Chinese traditional culture.
