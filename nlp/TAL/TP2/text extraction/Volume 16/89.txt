Optimization for reinforcement learning based 3D animation exercise

3D animation makes art “live” and gives works of art with vitality, thus enabling artistic charm to be better presented and artistic practice to create more value. Due to the superior 3D model creation of 3D animation, it has important practical prospects in the field of art. At the same time, 3D animation is an important part of the animation industry, and its artistic style affects the quality of animation works and derivatives. Against the backdrop of computer technology, computer has a great influence on 3D animation art, which greatly enhances the artistic expression of 3D animation and promotes new animation forms. The artistic expression of 3D animation is mainly reflected in the performance of light and film, space and motion, lens, details and texture, and traditional artistic expression of 3D technology. However, when viewing 3D animation, we are often affected by the network bandwidth which leads to lag in 3D animation video and affects the user Quality of experience (QoE). According to the duration of 3D animation videos, this paper divides them into three types and obtains better user QoE through reinforcement learning (RL). The datasets of 3D animation videos of different durations are used to train the RL model, and the corresponding reward function parameters of different 3D animation video durations are obtained. Therefore, duration-sensitive Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C)—RL algorithm is presented. The experimental results show that the A3C-RL algorithm has a much better user QoE for 3D animation video than that of state-of-the-art algorithms.
