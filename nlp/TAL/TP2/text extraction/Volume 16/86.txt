Special issue on “Recent advances on computational intelligence techniques and applications in big data”

In an era where Big Data has permeated every aspect of our lives, the importance of Computational Intelligence (CI) cannot be overstated. CI is not merely a set of computational techniques; it is a dynamic amalgamation of soft computing, machine learning, engineering disciplines, and more. It investigates, simulates, and analyzes exceptionally intricate issues and phenomena, closely related to Evolutionary Intelligence. This special issue aims to explore the rapid strides made in CI in the context of Big Data.
