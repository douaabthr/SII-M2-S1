A survey of image encryption for healthcare applications

Recently, medical image encryption has attracted many researchers because of security issues in the communication process. The recent COVID-19 has highlighted the fact that medical images are consistently created and disseminated online, leading to a need for protection from unauthorised utilisation. This paper intends to review the various medical image encryption approaches along with their merits and limitations. It includes a survey, a brief introduction, and the most utilised interesting applications of image encryption. Then, the contributions of reviewed approaches are summarised and compared regarding different technical perspectives. Lastly, we highlight the recent challenges along with several directions of potential research that could fill the gaps in these domains for researchers and developers.
