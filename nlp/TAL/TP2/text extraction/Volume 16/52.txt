MOSA/D: Multi-operator evolutionary many-objective algorithm with self-adaptation of parameters based on decomposition

In the domain of science and engineering optimization, many-objective problems have posed great challenges during the last few years. In response to this, several algorithms have been proposed that include generic as well as specific approaches for problem-solving. This paper proposes an improved evolutionary many-objective optimization (EMaO) method, MOSA/D, which is a Multi-Operator approach with Self-Adaptation of parameters based onDecomposition. It is a generic method based on the framework of the MOEA/D algorithm and aimed to explore the role of an ensemble of differential evolution operators for optimizing many-objective problems in the decomposition environment. Another contribution of this study is the detection of the start of the exploitation stage of evolution to enable the fine-tuning of solutions. The simulation studies involve comparing our approach with some selected state-of-the-art algorithms on standard test problems having 5-, 8-, 10-, 12- and 15-objective spaces. The experimental results show that the proposed MOSA/D is overall superior to other approaches in terms of attaining the convergence and diversity of solutions.
