Evaluation method of outward-bound based on neural network

Outward-bound is of great significance in physical education. How to use the neural network model for the outward-bound evaluation in order to provide trainers and trainees with training parameters that can be referred to for each extension exercise. This not only evaluates the effectiveness of each stretch, but also quantifies various metrics of each stretch, such as safety, efficiency, training intensity, and more. In this paper, we propose an evaluation model for outward-bound based on the neural network which is a computational intelligence method to provide trainers and trainees with training parameters that can be referred to for each extension exercise. First, we analyze and categorize different types of outreach programs. Second, we extract different indicators as feature data according to the learning process of outbound training. Third, we adopt the powerful learning ability of a neural network to make evaluation analysis. Finally, we experimentally verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.
