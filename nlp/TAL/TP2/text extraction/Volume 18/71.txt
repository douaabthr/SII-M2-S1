Application of interval Laplace transformation in a production system with price and quality dependent demand via water cycle algorithm

Laplace transformation is a potent mathematical approach utilised in many disciplines, including mathematics, engineering, physics, and control theory. It is generally used to simplify challenging mathematical issues and solve differential equations. Interval uncertainty is a notion used in decision theory, risk analysis, and statistics to express and manage uncertainty in a more flexible and less specific fashion. It is also known as interval-valued uncertainty or interval uncertainty analysis. It differs from point estimates and precise probabilities and is especially helpful when there is little knowledge of a variable’s specific value or when working with uncertain data. Here, we apply the concept of interval Laplace transformation for solving a manufacturing model as well as demand function is taken as interval forms on selling price and the quality of the item. We have solved the developed interval valued production model with the help of one numerical example, interval order relation and water cycle algorithm (WCA). In order to justify the results from WCA, we have compared the results from other popular metaheuristic algorithms. Lastly, an investigation of post optimality is being researched to offer some managerial insights.
