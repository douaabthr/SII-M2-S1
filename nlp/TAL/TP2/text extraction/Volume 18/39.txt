Multi-objective optimization for order assignment in the food cart evaluation system

The rapid growth of the food delivery industry, driven by increasingly busy lifestyles, presents customers with the challenge of finding high-quality food at an optimal price. This decision-making process is made more difficult by the lack of a trustworthy food cart evaluation system. This study proposes a model that enables customers to evaluate food carts based on service quality, food quality, and cost-effectiveness. The model applies multi-objective optimization to balance these factors, using three evolutionary algorithms: Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic algorithm II, Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2, and Indicator-Based Evolutionary Algorithm. The proposed system generates Pareto-optimal solutions that guide customers in selecting the best food carts. Additionally, the effectiveness of the proposed food cart evaluation system can be validated by comparing it with other algorithms in terms of Pareto optimal results, Hypervolume, Generational Distance, Inverted Generation Distance and Epsilon Indicator. The model was validated by Swiggy Food Chain data, which demonstrated that our approach effectively minimizes costs while maximizing food cart ratings. The results demonstrate that the proposed system can significantly enhance customer decision-making in selecting food carts, offering a practical tool for both consumers and the food delivery industry. Finally, using statistical techniques, we present a comparative study of the results with the current Zomato and Swiggy Food Chain data ratings.
