Mycelium neural architecture search

This paper proposes Mycelium-NAS, a novel, biologically inspired neural architecture search (NAS) approach based on mycelium network growth and adaptation. This novel approach formulates NAS as an emergent growth process, where architectures dynamically evolve through adaptive expansion, fusion, and reorientation of network components, mirroring the organic exploration of mycelium. In particular, it introduces hyphal growth strategies–branching, fusion, and orientation–as new operations for dynamically constructing neural architectures. A fitness-driven selection process optimizes performance while penalizing excessive parameters. Evaluated on image classification tasks, Mycelium-NAS demonstrates competitive performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Fashion-MNIST datasets, achieving a compelling balance between accuracy and parameter efficiency in comparison to established architectures. Our results highlight the potential of biologically-inspired search strategies to address the critical challenges in NAS, offering a resource-conscious and adaptable paradigm for automated neural network design.
