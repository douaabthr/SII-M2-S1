An intelligent approach for analyzing the effects of normal tumor immune unhealthy diet model through unsupervised physics informed neural-networks integrated with meta-heuristic algorithms

This paper presents the development of integrated intelligent computing using physics-informed neural networks to solve the mathematical normal-tumor immune-unhealthy diet model. The model considers vitamin intervention as a moderating factor within one day. A nonlinear activation function called sigmoid was used for the model across three different scenarios to define the fitness or error function. For computing the optimized biases and weights of physics-informed neural networks, hybridization of heuristic algorithms, particularly particle swarm optimization and neural networks algorithm are employed from\(-10\)to\(10\). The proposed technique's accuracy, reliability, and validity are demonstrated by consistently matching the results obtained using NDsolve from mathematics built-in function as a reference solution. Additionally, statistical analyses including absolute and mean squared errors are conducted to confirm further the precision and accuracy of the physics-informed neural networks. It is observed that the absolute errors and mean square error between the reference solution and proposed technique range from\({10}^{-2}\)to\({10}^{-9}\)and range from\({10}^{-6}\)to\({10}^{-11}\)for distinct cases. The novelty of this study highlights the importance of physics-informed neural networks for a balanced diet rich in vitamins for reducing the risk of deadly diseases, particularly cancer and the potential of machine learning algorithms in modelling and analyzing complex biological systems.
