Enhanced fractional probabilistic self-organizing maps with genetic algorithm optimization (EF-PRSOM)

The Fractional derivatives offer an effective method for incorporating memory into systems, increasing efficiency for tasks that require long-term memory processes. They provide considerable advantages over classical derivatives, enabling deeper analysis of complex processes through effective access to underlying aspects. Leveraging these benefits, this paper introduces a new clustering approach, Enhanced Fractional Probabilistic Self-Organizing Map and Genetic Algorithm optimization. This approach addresses the problem of kernel locality and the challenges associated with selecting the parameter\(\alpha\). To determine the appropriate order of\(\alpha\), we implemented an efficient method using Genetic Algorithm optimization, enhancing clustering quality by considering model complexity, goodness of fit, and cluster separation. Furthermore, the optimized EF-PRSOM was compared to several clustering methods across multiple datasets using the Dunn index. Remarkably, EF-PRSOM consistently outperformed its counterparts across all metrics. Additionally, the optimized EF-PRSOM has the potential to be applied to various tasks, including image compression, where its effectiveness could be assessed using performance measures such as Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio and Structural Similarity Index. This highlights the versatility of the proposed EF-PRSOM method across different applications.
