Voltage stability constrained transmission network expansion planning using fast convergent grey wolf optimization algorithm

Transmission network expansion planning problem (TNEP) is of utmost importance in power system now a days. In this paper, a voltage stability indicator (L-index) is applied to limit the voltage of buses. Hence TNEP is formulated incorporating this voltage stability feature. Thus formulated TNEP is termed as voltage stability constrained TNEP (VSC-TNEP). TNEP has been solved using various conventional and non-conventional strategies by various researchers in these days. Here, TNEP and VSC-TNEP for IEEE-24 bus test system is solved using grey wolf optimization technique (GWO) and modified GWO. The modified GWO algorithm namely, fast convergent GWO (FCGWO) is validated over 25 standard benchmark test functions and compared with other techniques.
