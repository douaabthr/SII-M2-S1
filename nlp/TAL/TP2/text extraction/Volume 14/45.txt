Visual topic models for healthcare data clustering

Social media is a great source to search health-related topics for envisages solutions towards healthcare. Topic models originated from Natural Language Processing that is receiving much attention in healthcare areas because of interpretability and its decision making, which motivated us to develop visual topic models. Topic models are used for the extraction of health topics for analyzing discriminative and coherent latent features of tweet documents in healthcare applications. Discovering the number of topics in topic models is an important issue. Sometimes, users enable an incorrect number of topics in traditional topic models, which leads to poor results in health data clustering. In such cases, proper visualizations are essential to extract information for identifying cluster trends. To aid in the visualization of topic clouds and health tendencies in the document collection, we present hybrid topic modeling techniques by integrating traditional topic models with visualization procedures. We believe proposed visual topic models viz., Visual Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (VNMF), Visual Latent Dirichlet Allocation (VLDA), Visual intJNon-negative Matrix Factorization (VintJNMF), and Visual Probabilistic Latent Schematic Indexing (VPLSI) are promising methods for extracting tendency of health topics from various sources in healthcare data clustering. Standard and benchmark social health datasets are used in an experimental study to demonstrate the efficiency of proposed models concerning clustering accuracy (CA), Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), precision (P), recall (R), F-Score (F) measures and computational complexities. VNMF visual model performs significantly at an increased rate of 32.4% under cosine based metric in the display of visual clusters and an increased rate of 35–40% in performance measures compared to other visual methods on different number of health topics.
