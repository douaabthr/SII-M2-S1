Hybrid encryption framework for securing big data storage in multi-cloud environment

In the present scenario, big data is facing many challenges regarding the data storage, data theft and unauthorized access. Many researchers are concentrated on developing the security mechanism for big data storage. To overcome the above issue, this paper concentrated on developing the encryption algorithm for storing big data in the multi cloud storage. The multi cloud storage environment permits the user to store the data in to different cloud storage services. This paper aims to develop the secure framework which restricts the insider attacks. The proposed framework contains data uploading, slicing, indexing, encryption, distribution, decryption, retrieval and merging process. The hybrid encryption algorithm was developed to provide the security to the big data before storing it in to the multi cloud. The Simulation analysis is carried with real time cloud storage environments. The proposed algorithm recorded around 2630 KB/S for the encryption process. The results prove the superiority of the proposed algorithm compared to the bench mark algorithms.
