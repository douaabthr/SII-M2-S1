Mesh smoothing of complex geometry using variations of cohort intelligence algorithm

Several approaches including optimization based methods were developed for mesh quality improvement using only node movement, keeping intact the element connectivity. In this research, a socio-inspired optimization approach referred to as cohort intelligence (CI) was investigated for mesh smoothing. Minimization of summation of condition numbers of all elements was the final aim. The geometrical boundaries of the object defined the surface and edge constraints for movement of external nodes. Movement of internal nodes was completely governed by variations of CI algorithm, viz. roulette wheel, follow best, follow better, alienation and random selection, follow worst and follow itself. The approach was demonstrated with pentagonal prism, hexagonal prism and hexagonal prism with hole. The performance of follow best and roulette wheel variations of CI algorithm was observed to be satisfactory as compared to other variations of the algorithm.
