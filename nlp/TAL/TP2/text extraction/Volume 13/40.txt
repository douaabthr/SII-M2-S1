Incremental document clustering using fuzzy-based optimization strategy

The technical advances in the information systems contribute towards the massive availability of the documents stored in the electronic database, such as e-mails, internet and web pages. Thus, it becomes a complex task for arranging and browsing the required document. This paper proposes an incremental document clustering method for performing effective document clustering. The proposed model undergoes three steps for document clustering, namely pre-processing, feature extraction and Incremental document categorization. The pre-processing step is carried out for removing the artifacts and redundant data from the documents by undergoing stop word removal process and stemming process. Then, the next step is the feature extraction based on Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF–IDF) and Wordnet features. Here, the feature is selected using support measure named ModSupport, and then, the incremental document clustering is performed based on the hybrid fuzzy bounding degree and Rider-Moth Flame optimization algorithm (RMFO) using the boundary degree. Here, the RMFO aims at the selection of the optimal weights for the boundary degree model and is designed by integrating Rider Optimization Algorithm (ROA) with Moth Flame optimization (MFO). The performance of the proposed RMFO outperformed the existing techniques using accuracy, F-measure, precision, and recall with maximal values 93.98%, 94.876%, 93.958% and 93.964% respectively.
