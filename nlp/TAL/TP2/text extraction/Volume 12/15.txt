Cross domain association using transfer subspace learning

Transfer learning has gained more attention recently by utilizing knowledge acquired from one domain to advance a learning performance in another domain. Existing homogeneous transfer learning methods have progressed to a point where feature spaces are common in training and testing domains. However, heterogeneous transfer learning is still in its nascent stage where features of training and testing domains are different. Taking this into account, Bregman Divergence Regularization is used to minimize the probability distribution difference between training and testing domains and to take them together to a shared subspace. To discriminate data within individual domains, a projection matrix is obtained using Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis subspace learning algorithm. Experimentation is performed on two efficiently used biometrics: the face and fingerprint. Two types of cross-domain settings are used: (1) Face + Finger2Finger where training samples come from face (labeled samples) and fingerprint (unlabeled samples) data sets, while testing is performed on a fingerprint dataset. (2) Finger + Face2Face where training samples come from fingerprint (labeled samples) and face (unlabeled samples) data sets while testing is performed on a face dataset. This paper proposes a cross domain association between face and fingerprint that finds utility in forensic applications.
