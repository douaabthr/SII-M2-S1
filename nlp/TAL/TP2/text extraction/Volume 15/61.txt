A survey of energy-aware cluster head selection techniques in wireless sensor network

Recently, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are becoming very famous as they are inexpensive and easy to maintain and manage. The network contains a group of sensor nodes, which are capable of sensing, computing, and transmitting. Energy efficiency is one of the most important challenging problems in WSN. Sensor nodes have inadequate energy and installed in remote areas. Hence, it is difficult to restore the batteries in WSN. Therefore, to maximize the network lifetime, appropriate clustering techniques and cluster head (CH) selection methods should be implemented. The main idea behind the clustering technique is that it clusters the sensor nodes and reduces the composed data simultaneously and then, it broadcasts the data. In this process, CH selection is an essential part. Therefore, this survey paper provides an overview of the clustering techniques for reducing energy consumption by reviewing several CH selection techniques in WSN that provide high energy efficiency. Several techniques have been employed for CH selection based on partitional clustering, optimization, low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy, hierarchical, distributed, and other classification methods. Finally, an analysis is done based on the implementation tools, metrics employed, accuracy, and achievements of the considered CH selection techniques.
