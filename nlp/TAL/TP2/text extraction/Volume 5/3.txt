Using genetical and cultural search to design unorganised machines

In 1948 Turing presented a general representation scheme by which to achieve artificial intelligence—his unorganised machines. Significantly, these were a form of discrete dynamical system and yet dynamical representations remain almost unexplored within evolutionary computation. Further, at the same time as also suggesting that natural evolution may provide inspiration for search mechanisms to design machines, he noted that mechanisms inspired by the social aspects of learning may prove useful. This paper presents results from an investigation into using Turing’s dynamical representation designed by Evolutionary Programming and a new imitation-based, i.e., cultural, approach. Moreover, the original synchronous and an asynchronous form of unorganised machines are considered.
