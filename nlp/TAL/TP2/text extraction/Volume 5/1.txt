Foreword: Special issue on Alan Turing

In a little known 1948National Physical Laboratory(NPL) report entitled “Intelligent Machinery” [3], which wasn’t published until 1968 [1], 14 years after his death, Alan Turing described bothconnectionist ideasandgenetical search. In his analogy between learning and search, he suggested that intellectual, genetical, and cultural searches may all be used to inspire mechanisms by which to achieve machine intelligence.“There is the genetical or evolutionary search by which a combination of genes is looked for, the criterion being survival value. The remarkable success of this search confirms to some extent the idea that intellectual activity consists mainly of various kinds of search” [4, p. 23].
