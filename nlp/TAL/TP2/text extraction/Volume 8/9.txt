XCSF with tile coding in discontinuous action-value landscapes

Tile coding is an effective reinforcement learning method that uses a rather ingenious generalization mechanism based on (1) a carefully designed parameter setting and (2) the assumption that nearby states in the problem space will correspond to similar payoff predictions in the action-value function. Previously, we extended XCSF with tile coding prediction and compared it to tabular tile coding, showing that (1) XCSF performs as well as parameter-optimized tile coding, while also (2) evolving individualized parameter settings in each problem subspace. Our comparison was based on a set of well-known reinforcement learning environments (2D Gridworld and the Mountain Car) that involved no action-value discontinuities and so posed no challenge to tabular tile coding. In this paper, we go a step further and test XCSF with tile coding on a set of problems designed to challenge tile coding by introducing discontinuities in the action value landscape. The new testbed (called MazeWorld) extends 2D Gridworld with impenetrable obstacles, a conceptually simple modification that can dramatically increase the problem complexity for tabular tile coding. We compare four versions of XCSF with tile coding (each adapting a different set of parameters) to tabular tile coding on four problems of increasing complexity. We show that our system (1) needs fewer training problems than standard tile coding to reach an optimal policy; (2) it can evolve adequate coding parameters in each subspace without any previous knowledge; and that (3) even when XCSF is not allowed to evolve these parameters, the genetic algorithm will still adapt classifier conditions to properly decompose the problem into subspaces thus being much less sensitive to the parameter settings than tabular tile coding.
