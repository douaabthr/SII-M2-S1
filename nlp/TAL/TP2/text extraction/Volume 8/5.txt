Special issue on the 20th anniversary of XCS

This issue is dedicated to Stewart Wilson both in recognition of his achievements and in appreciation for his guidance of the field. Not only has his research transformed the field, but his support, encouragement, and advice have been invaluable to many of us individually and to the community as a whole.
