Evolutionary computation as an artificial attacker: generating evasion attacks for detector vulnerability testing

Intrusion detection systems protect our infrastructures by monitoring for signs of intrusions. However, intrusion detection systems are themselves susceptible to vulnerabilities, which the attackers take advantage of to evade detection. In particular, we focus on evasion attacks in which the attacker aims to generate a stealthy attack that eliminates or minimizes the likelihood of detection. Attackers achieve stealth by mimicking normal behaviour while achieving the attack goals, hence bypassing the detector. Previous work focused on generating evasion attacks using the internal knowledge of the detectors, hence adopting a ‘white-box’ access to the detector. On the other hand, we adopt a ‘black-box’ approach and propose an evolutionary attacker based on Genetic Programming. The access of our ‘black-box’ approach is limited to the feedback of the detector such as anomaly rates and delays. We compare our ‘black-box’ approach with various ‘white-box’ approaches to investigate its effectiveness. In doing so, the impact of anomalies from the break-in stage of the attacks and the delays based on locality frame counts are also discussed. This is particularly important if the performance comparison is to reflect the real capabilities of detectors.
