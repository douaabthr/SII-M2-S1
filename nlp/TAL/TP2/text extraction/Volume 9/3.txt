An upper and lower CUSUM for signal normalization in the dendritic cell algorithm

Signal normalization is a part of signal formalization which is a vital data pre-processing constraint required for the functioning of the dendritic cell algorithm. In existing applications, most normalization algorithms are developed purposely for a specific application with drawing on human domain expertise and very few algorithms are designed for general problems. This makes it difficult for the inexperienced user to exploit existing approaches to another problem, particularly when the initial information about the problem is limited. Therefore, this study proposes a new signal normalization method for the dendritic cell algorithm that uses the statistical upper and lower cumulative sum so that the algorithm can be applied to general classification problems. In addition, a new method to calculate the anomaly threshold based on the average mature-contact antigen value is presented to suit the proposed algorithm. The proposed model is evaluated by applying it to eight universal classification datasets and assessing its performance according to four measurement metrics: detection rate, specificity, false alarm rate, and accuracy. Its performance is compared with that of the existing dendritic cell algorithm and four non-bio-inspired classifiers, namely, rough set, decision tree, naïve Bayes, and multilayer perceptron. The results show that the proposed model outperforms the existing model and the other classifiers as well as demonstrates a significant improvement in terms of specificity, false alarm rate, and accuracy for all datasets. This indicates that the proposed normalization approach can be applied to general classification problems and can improve detection performance.
