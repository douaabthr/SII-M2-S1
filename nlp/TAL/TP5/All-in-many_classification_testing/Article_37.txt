A hybrid approach towards content-based image retrieval for colored images using enhanced first type of pessimistic covering based lower approximation multi-granular rough sets.
Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) is used to follow a strategy which allows getting the desired images as identified by means of given input to the maximum extent possible, but in most of the occasions the result is bounded nearest to the expected but not exactly. In other words the result is nearest as along with the nearest output the user has maximum chances of getting other irrelevant results too. To overcome or to reduce this kind of situation we have decided to go with a method which accepts the input from the user and accordingly the images are classified into two covers based on the interest of the input. Further the first cover is resulted after applying a procedure which performs the task of averaging the cardinality of the given input. The second cover is resulted with some valuable values in the form of content which fulfills the nature of expected second input with the help of applying a moments oriented technique. The input from these two covers are passed to the next phase where the proposed algorithm is applied and which results into much filtered form of output and which further ease the task of proposed matching algorithm. The experiments are tested and validated using Corel dataset and the results proves that the proposed approach is looking better and sometimes equal with the other compared methods.
