Semantic approaches for query expansion.
To increase the Information Retrieval System’s efficiency, there is a requirement to expand the native user query. There are many approaches to enhance the user query in which the primary method consists of semantic-based query expansion (QE). In a semantic-based QE approach, relevant documents are retrieved by considering all the similar terms of a given user query. The semantic-based QE approach helps in dealing with the limitation of low recall and low precision value of the Information retrieval system and deals with ambiguity and vagueness. Query Expansion techniques contain the semantic concepts that are relevant to semantic computing, computational intelligence, and information retrieval area. Computational intelligence technique is required during automatic query expansion for advanced information processing. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the methods proposed by several researchers considering semantic-based query expansion. It also discusses the merits and demerits of each technique in a detailed manner. This paper presents the view of several semantic query expansion core techniques. This paper also discusses the various keyholes present in today’s era.
