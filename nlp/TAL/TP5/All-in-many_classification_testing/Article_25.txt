A review on various methodologies used for vehicle classification, helmet detection and number plate recognition.
Vehicle detection and classification has been an area of application of image processing and machine learning which is being researched extensively in accordance with its importance due to increasing number of vehicles, traffic rule defaulters and accidents. This paper aims to review various methodologies used and how it has evolved to give better results in the past years, closely moving towards usage of machine learning. This has resulted in advancing the problem statement towards helmet detection followed by number plate detection of defaulters. Object detection and Text recognition that are available in various frameworks offer built-in models which are easy to use or offer easy methods to build and train customized models.
