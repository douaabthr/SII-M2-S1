Particle swarm optimization based metamaterial inspired circularly polarized patch antenna for S band applications.
In this paper Particle Swarm Optimization technique (PSO) has been used to design a metamaterial inspired circularly polarised patch antenna with truncated corners and embedded square slots. The circular polarization has been achieved by trimming the corners of the square patch along one of its diagonal and square slots have been embedded along these truncated corners to improve the 3 dB axial ratio bandwidth of this proposed antenna. To achieve the maximum axial ratio bandwidth, the dimensions of this square slot have been optimized using PSO algorithm. Without any square slot, the axial ratio bandwidth of the patch antenna is 700 MHz. However, when square slots are embedded along the trimmed corners, with slot length w = 2.3 mm, axial ratio bandwidth of 1150 MHz is achieved. But, when PSO is applied to obtain the optimized dimension of this square slot so as to maximize this axial ratio bandwidth, the optimised w is determined to be 2.8 mm and the axial ratio bandwidth with this optimized slot length is determine to be 1600 MHz. Thus it is observed that by using the optimized value of w, obtained by using PSO technique, improvement in axial ratio bandwidth by 450 MHz is observed. To improve its gain, an array of splitted circular metamaterial rings is etched on the ground plane of this proposed patch antenna. The circularly polarised patch antenna with truncated corners resonates at 2.4 GHz with gain of 4.8 dBic and impedance bandwidth of 600 MHz. However, when square shaped slots of optimized length are embedded in the truncated corners and metamaterial substrate is loaded on the ground plane of this antenna, its gain reaches to 5.2 dBic. All simulations are done in an electronic simulator, HFSS.
