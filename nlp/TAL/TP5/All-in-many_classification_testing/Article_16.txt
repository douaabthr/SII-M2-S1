On deep ensemble CNN–SAE based novel agro-market price forecasting.
The prices of agro-commodities are highly volatile. Hence it is a challenge to the farmers to ensure fair and remunerative prices of these commodities. As a result, there is a need for prediction of agro market price appropriately. The closing price prediction of one soft commodity product, Cotton 29 mm and one agro-commodity product, Guar gum are chosen. The existing reported methods exhibit poor prediction performance. To alleviate this problem, the current investigation is undertaken for better prediction of closing prices. The deep ensemble approach using convolutional neural network (CNN) and stacked autoencoder (SAE) is employed to improve the prediction performance. For the ensemble strategy, the weights are optimized using three bio-inspired techniques such as genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO) and spider monkey optimization (SMO). Eighteen attributes relating to the closing price of each products are considered as input to the proposed models. The simulation based experimental results demonstrate the following contribution of the paper. Firstly, it is observed that CNN outperforms the SAE model in terms of short range prediction and vice versa for long range prediction. Secondly, the prediction performance of all the three ensemble models has been determined.
 Thirdly, out of three ensemble models, ensemble-SMO (ESMO) shows the best prediction performance in terms of mean square error and coefficient of multiple determination (R2). It is then followed by ensemble-PSO and ensemble-GA respectively. The performance of proposed best ESMO is compared with the Grey wolf optimization based multiquadratic kernel KELM model (GWO-KELM) and it is observed that the proposed ESMO outperforms the GWO-KELM model.
