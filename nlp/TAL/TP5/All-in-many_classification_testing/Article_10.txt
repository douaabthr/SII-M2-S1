The effective SVM-based binary prediction of ground water table.
Groundwater resources are limited, to measure the groundwater and predict the data is a challenging task. Water is the major resource for living being and nonrenewable, hence to model and predict the groundwater is great significance in the present day scenario. In this paper collected the recent datasets of longitude of and latitude of 2018, 2019 depth of groundwater level analyzed and predicted the datasets of Chittoor (Andhra Pradesh, India) and Greater Noida (Gautham Budh Nagar, Uttar Pradesh in India) regions. The proposed machine learning model, by using the Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based binary prediction, the proposed model carries out the effective results and optimized approach. The model is applied in South India region and North India region and compared. Results proved that the proposed approach is a better approach for predicting groundwater table by using SVM-based binary prediction since it also involves optimization.
