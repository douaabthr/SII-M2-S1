An efficient priority based resource management framework for IoT enabled applications in the cloud.
Internet of things (IoT) enabled applications are gaining importance in the recent times in many services likehealth care, smart homes, security services etc. The IoT enabled application generates huge volumes of data by continuously monitoring the environment. However, the IoT nodes are supported by cloud computing to meet computational and storage requirements due to limited computation capacity and storage. This paper presents cloud based framework for priority based IoT applications that use resources in an effective manner based on the emergency of the applications by the cloud. The simulation results proved the efficacy of the proposed framework with respect to CPU utilization and memory utilization. It is shown that the memory utilisation is 70% and CPU utilisation is 90% for the proposed framework and it performs better when compared with existing methods.
