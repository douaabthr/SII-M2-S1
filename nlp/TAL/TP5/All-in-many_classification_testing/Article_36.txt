An improved security and privacy management system for data in multi-cloud environments using a hybrid approach.
Storing and accessing the information in the multi-cloud hosting environment becomes popular these days. It offers benefits like the assurance of data protection, preventing information corruption, unethical issues from vendors. In this paper, a hybrid approach with the multi-cloud hosting environment is designed and implemented for improved security and privacy of cloud data. The hybrid method consists of three modules (a) Byzantine protocol to tolerant security breaches to server failures cloud, which is independent. (b) DepSky architecture enhances the reliability and secrecy of data preserved in the cloud using encoding and decoding techniques (c) Shamir secret sharing procedure to improve trustiness & privacy of data storage without affecting the performance. The privacy and security issues of the hybrid approach are implemented and compared with the protocols like SAML with proxy re-encryption and Kerberos for different user service requests. The performance of the hybrid approach in terms of memory utilization, encryption/decryption time, total authentication time is improved compared to that of protocol environments SAML, SAML with proxy re-encryption and Kerberos. The results were encouraging in the Hybrid Approach in terms of encryption time/decryption time, Memory utilization and average precision values.
