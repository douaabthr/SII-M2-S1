HABCGWO: a hybrid artificial bee colony and grey wolf optimization technique for energy efficient framework in WSN.
The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging technology that has multiple applications. Multiple Internet of Things (IoT) sensors gather environmental data. The hubs collect environmental data from sensor nodes. Global sensors send notifications to a central command center regarding any alterations. Nevertheless, the system may be hindered by constraints such as computing limitations, power restrictions, transmission limitations, and restricted sensor store capacity. Our goal is to decrease energy consumption in IoT systems by utilizing swarm intelligence. The effectiveness of swarm intelligence, which is based on stochastic global hunt phenomena, relies on the randomization of nodes in IoT networks. Our solution analyzes crucial metaheuristics for IoT network performance. We are researching techniques to minimize energy consumption in sensors in order to prolong the lifespan of IoT networks. This analysis selects the most efficient node for IoT energy use. Efforts should be made to enhance the exploration of wolves by promoting the exchange of knowledge, similar to how bees do, but yet preserving their hunting techniques. Modify the settings of GWO (Grey Wolf Optimizer) to prevent premature convergence and enhance the speed of searching the probable search zone. We assess the performance of ABC, GWO, GWO-GA, and PSGWO algorithms in comparison to HABCGWO. Findings: The suggested framework achieves a decrease in energy usage of 19.8% for ABC, 21.6% for GWO, 33.9% for GWO-GA, and 27.8% for PSGWO. Conclusion: This study enhances the performance of IoT nodes by prioritizing energy efficiency, network longevity, the number of active nodes, temperature, and throughput. Through the utilization of simulations and metaheuristics, we have observed that HABCGWO leads to a rise in energy usage and a decrease in energy consumption.
